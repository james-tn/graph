  2.4.1 in a professional and workmanlike manner, with due skill and care, and in accordance with generally accepted industry standards for similar services;

  2.4.2 in accordance with the schedules and milestones set forth in the applicable SOW, subject to Section 13.4 (Changes) and Article XV (Force Majeure);

  2.4.3 in compliance with Applicable Law and the written instructions of Contoso, provided such instructions are reasonably consistent with the SOW; and

  2.4.4 using personnel who are appropriately qualified and experienced for the tasks to which they are assigned.

2.5 **Project Management and Reporting.** Gamma shall appoint a project manager (“**Gamma Project Manager**”) who shall serve as Gamma’s primary point of contact for each SOW. Contoso shall appoint a corresponding project manager (“**Contoso Project Manager**”). The Parties’ project managers shall meet (in person or via teleconference/videoconference) at reasonable intervals as set forth in the SOW, to review progress, discuss issues, and track the status of Deliverables. Gamma shall provide, at a minimum, monthly written status reports summarizing work completed, upcoming tasks, and identified risks and issues.

2.6 **Acceptance of Deliverables.**

  2.6.1 Upon delivery of any Deliverable, Gamma shall notify Contoso in writing. Contoso shall have the review period specified in the applicable SOW (and if none is specified, fifteen (15) Business Days) to review and either accept or reject the Deliverable based on the acceptance criteria set forth in the SOW.

  2.6.2 If Contoso reasonably determines that a Deliverable does not conform in all material respects to the applicable acceptance criteria, Contoso shall provide Gamma with a written description of the non-conformities. Gamma shall, at no additional cost, use commercially reasonable efforts to correct such non-conformities and re-deliver the Deliverable within a reasonable period.

  2.6.3 The Deliverable shall be deemed accepted upon the earliest of: (a) Contoso’s written acceptance; (b) Contoso’s use of the Deliverable in a production environment (other than for testing); or (c) the expiration of the applicable review period without written rejection.

  (b) furnishing accurate and complete information and Client Materials;  
  (c) making timely decisions and approvals; and  
  (d) fulfilling any responsibilities specified in the applicable SOW.

Gamma shall not be responsible for delays or failures in performance caused by Contoso’s failure to fulfill its obligations; any related deadlines and Service Levels shall be reasonably extended to account for such delays.

2.8 **Subcontractors.** Gamma may, in its discretion, use subcontractors or Affiliates to perform any portion of the Services; provided that Gamma shall remain responsible for the performance of such subcontractors and Affiliates and shall ensure that they are bound by written obligations of confidentiality and data protection no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement.

2.9 **High-Risk Acknowledgment.** Contoso acknowledges that the Services may involve integration with critical production systems and business processes, and that incorrect implementation or use of such systems may create significant operational and financial risks. Contoso therefore agrees to cooperate fully with Gamma, to follow Gamma’s written implementation and configuration guidance, and to accept that Gamma’s recommendations may be a material condition for achieving the intended outcomes.

  (c) assist Contoso, to the extent reasonably practicable and at Contoso’s expense, in responding to requests from data subjects and in ensuring compliance with Contoso’s obligations under Data Protection Laws, such as security, breach notification, impact assessments, and consultations with supervisory authorities.

11.3 **Subprocessors.** Contoso authorizes Gamma to engage subcontractors and subprocessors to process Personal Data on behalf of Contoso, provided that Gamma shall: (a) impose on such subprocessors data protection obligations that are no less protective than those set out in this Article XI; and (b) remain liable for the acts and omissions of such subprocessors to the same extent Gamma would be liable if performing the services of the subprocessor directly.

11.4 **International Transfers.** To the extent Personal Data is transferred outside the jurisdiction in which it was originally collected, Gamma shall ensure that such transfer complies with applicable Data Protection Laws (e.g., through appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses, if required).

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized access, acquisition, or disclosure of Personal Data or other security incident that materially compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of Personal Data processed by Gamma on behalf of Contoso (a “**Data Breach**”), Gamma shall:

  (a) notify Contoso without undue delay (and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours) after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  
  (b) provide Contoso with information known to Gamma regarding the nature and impact of the Data Breach, including, where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records affected;  
  (c) cooperate with Contoso in investigating and mitigating the Data Breach; and  
  (d) take reasonably necessary steps to remediate and prevent a recurrence of the Data Breach.

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Gamma shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon Contoso’s written request or upon termination of this Agreement, Gamma shall, at Contoso’s option and subject to Applicable Law: (a) return to Contoso all Personal Data in Gamma’s possession or control; or (b) securely delete or anonymize such Personal Data, except to the extent retention is required by law. Any retained Personal Data shall remain subject to the data protection and confidentiality obligations herein.

12.2 **Response and Resolution Times.** Gamma shall adhere to the following incident response targets, unless otherwise specified in the SOW:

  - **Critical Incidents (Priority 1)** – System or major function unavailable, impacting critical business operations:  
    Response Time: within one (1) hour; Target Resolution or Workaround: within eight (8) hours.  

  - **High Incidents (Priority 2)** – Severe degradation with significant impact, but partial functionality remains:  
    Response Time: within four (4) hours; Target Resolution: within two (2) Business Days.  

  - **Medium Incidents (Priority 3)** – Limited impact and system still functional:  
    Response Time: within one (1) Business Day; Target Resolution: within five (5) Business Days.

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may, from time to time, propose changes to the scope of the Services, Deliverables, timelines, or other terms of an SOW (a “**Change Request**”). Change Requests shall be submitted in writing and shall describe the proposed changes, the rationale, and any requested timing.

13.2 **Evaluation of Changes.** Upon receipt of a Change Request, the receiving Party shall evaluate the request and may request additional information as reasonably necessary. Gamma shall assess the impact of any proposed change on the Fees, timelines, resources, and technical feasibility, and shall provide Contoso with a written impact assessment.

13.3 **Change Orders.** If the Parties agree to proceed with a proposed change, they shall document such change in a written amendment to the applicable SOW (a “**Change Order**”) signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. No Change Request shall be effective unless and until a corresponding Change Order is executed.

13.4 **Effect on Performance.** Gamma shall have no obligation to commence work on any requested change, nor shall it be bound by any assumed impact on Fees or schedules, until a Change Order is executed. If Contoso requests that Gamma commence work on a Change Request prior to execution of a Change Order, Gamma may do so at its discretion, and such work shall be performed on a time-and-materials basis at Gamma’s then-current standard rates, pending formalization in a Change Order.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any SOW (a “**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute promptly by negotiation between executives who have authority to settle the Dispute. Either Party may initiate such negotiation by providing written notice to the other Party, describing the Dispute in reasonable detail.

14.2 **Mediation.** If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through negotiation within thirty (30) days after the date of the notice initiating negotiations, either Party may require that the Dispute be submitted to non-binding mediation before a mediator mutually selected by the Parties.

The Parties shall share equally the mediator’s fees and expenses; each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs.

The language of the arbitration shall be English. The arbitral award shall be final and binding on the Parties and may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

14.4 **Interim Relief.** Nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking provisional, interim, or injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information or intellectual property rights, or to prevent irreparable harm, pending the final resolution of the Dispute.

14.5 **Confidentiality of Proceedings.** The Parties shall keep confidential the existence of the Dispute, the arbitration proceedings, and any settlement or award, except as required by law or to enforce an arbitral award.
