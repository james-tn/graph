  (i) Titan shall ensure that a qualified maintenance technician or building engineer is available onsite or on-call during Operating Hours for routine work orders and scheduled preventive maintenance affecting the Premises.  
  (ii) Titan shall also maintain an after-hours on-call rotation for Priority 1 (Critical) and Priority 2 (High) issues as described in **Section 12.3** of the Parent Agreement, with response times as refined in **Section 12.3** of this Amendment.  
  (iii) Preventive maintenance schedules for HVAC, electrical distribution, fire protection systems, and loading dock equipment serving the Premises shall be documented in writing and shared with Contoso on at least a quarterly basis.

  (i) Titan shall coordinate use of loading docks, driveways, and truck staging areas to accommodate Contoso’s increased inbound and outbound truck movements, while maintaining reasonable access for other tenants.  
  (ii) Titan shall implement reasonable procedures for traffic flow, signage, and operational rules for truck queuing, consistent with Applicable Law and safety standards.  
  (iii) Titan shall, in consultation with Contoso, schedule any disruptive common area work (e.g., major repairs or resurfacing of parking lots or loading areas) outside of Contoso’s peak logistics windows where commercially reasonable.

(c) **Enhanced Security Measures.**  
  (i) In addition to the base building security systems described in **Section 2.3(d)** of the Parent Agreement, Titan shall implement (or cause to be implemented) additional CCTV coverage focused on loading dock areas, primary warehouse entries, and designated high-value inventory zones within reasonable proximity to the Premises, subject to applicable privacy and labor laws.

(d) **Utilities Monitoring and Optimization.**  
  (i) Titan shall implement or utilize existing sub-metering and energy monitoring solutions to provide Contoso with monthly reporting on electricity, gas (if applicable), and water usage attributable to the Premises.  
  (ii) Titan shall, upon Contoso’s reasonable written request (not more than once per calendar quarter), participate in a joint energy review, identify peak usage patterns, and propose commercially reasonable cost-optimization measures, which may include changes in set points, scheduling of high-consumption equipment, and lighting management.  
  (iii) Titan’s obligations under this Section shall not reduce Contoso’s responsibility to pay for utilities as Additional Rent under **Section 3.3** of the Parent Agreement; rather, they are intended to provide transparency and opportunities for efficiency.

(e) **Reporting and Governance.**  
  (i) Titan shall provide Contoso with **monthly SLA performance reports** summarizing: (A) maintenance tickets opened and closed; (B) response and resolution times by priority; (C) uptime of critical systems; and (D) any SLA breaches and corrective actions.

(f) **Management of Tenant-Requested Improvements.**  
  (i) To the extent Contoso requests any Improvements pursuant to **Section 2.5(b) (Tenant Improvements)** of the Parent Agreement during the Amended Term, Titan shall, upon Contoso’s written request, provide project management services limited to coordination with contractors, scheduling access, and ensuring compliance with building standards.

  (ii) the Amended SLAs set forth in **Article XII** of this Amendment, which refine and supplement **Article XII** of the Parent Agreement; and  
  (iii) Applicable Law, including health, safety, environmental, and data protection requirements.

(b) Persistent and material failure to meet Amended SLAs may give rise to Rent Abatement Credits under **Section 12.4** of this Amendment, and may also constitute grounds for termination for cause by Contoso under **Section 4.4(b)(i)** of the Parent Agreement, as preserved by **Article IV** of this Amendment.

2.5 **No Expansion of Premises Without Written Agreement.**  

Nothing in this Amendment shall be construed as expanding the physical boundaries of the Premises as defined in **Section 1.1(m)** of the Parent Agreement; however, it does clarify that Contoso’s non-exclusive rights to parking, loading docks, driveways, and common areas shall include the additional coordination and security obligations described herein.
