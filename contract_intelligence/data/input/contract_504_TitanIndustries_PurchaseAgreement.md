## ARTICLE II  
SCOPE OF SERVICES AND WORK

2.1 **General Description.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Titan shall provide to Contoso, on a non-exclusive basis, the Services and Deliverables set forth herein and in each applicable SOW. The Parties anticipate that Titan’s Services will include, without limitation:

  (a) **Component Sourcing and Procurement.** Titan shall source and procure raw materials, components, and subassemblies required for the manufacture of Contoso’s industrial equipment, including electronics, mechanical parts, and packaging materials, in accordance with the Specifications and any approved vendor lists provided by Contoso. Titan shall manage supplier relationships, negotiate pricing where authorized, and maintain appropriate safety stock as agreed in an SOW.

  (b) **Manufacturing and Assembly.** Titan shall perform precision manufacturing and assembly of designated Contoso products, including CNC machining, sheet metal fabrication, PCB assembly, mechanical integration, and system-level assembly. Titan shall ensure that all assembly processes comply with the Specifications, quality standards, and Applicable Laws, including any industry-specific standards (e.g., ISO 9001, IPC-A-610, as applicable).

  (c) **Testing and Quality Assurance.** Titan shall develop and implement testing and quality assurance procedures consistent with the Specifications and quality requirements of Contoso. This includes functional testing, burn-in, environmental stress screening, calibration, and final inspection, as applicable. Titan shall maintain traceability records, test reports, and non-conformance logs, and shall provide such documentation to Contoso upon request.

  (d) **Packaging, Labeling, and Logistics.** Titan shall package and label the Deliverables in accordance with Contoso’s branding and packaging requirements, including barcodes, serial numbers, regulatory marks, and documentation inserts. Titan shall coordinate outbound logistics, including preparation for shipment, loading, and documentation, and will either arrange transportation (if specified in an SOW) or cooperate with Contoso’s designated carriers.

  (e) **Engineering and Technical Support.** Titan shall provide engineering support, including design-for-manufacturability reviews, process optimization, and cost-reduction recommendations. Titan may propose engineering changes to improve quality, yield, or cost, subject to Contoso’s prior written approval as set forth in Article XIII (Change Management).

  (f) **After-Sales and Field Support (if applicable).** To the extent set forth in an SOW, Titan shall provide repair, refurbishment, rework, and field-return analysis services, including failure analysis, corrective actions, and reporting.

2.2 **Statements of Work.**  
All specific projects, product families, volumes, and detailed requirements shall be described in one or more SOWs. Each SOW shall reference this Agreement by its contract reference number **PUR-TIT-202504-504**, and shall include, at a minimum: (i) description of Deliverables and Services; (ii) applicable Specifications; (iii) schedule and milestones; (iv) pricing, fees, and payment schedule (consistent with Article III); (v) acceptance criteria; and (vi) any additional terms. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and an SOW, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail unless the SOW expressly states that it is intended to supersede a specific provision of this Agreement.

2.3 **Performance Standards.**  
Titan shall perform the Services and provide the Deliverables:

  (a) in a professional, workmanlike manner using personnel with appropriate skills and experience;

  (b) in accordance with the Specifications, Service Levels, and quality requirements defined in this Agreement and any SOW;

  (c) in compliance with Applicable Laws, including all applicable safety, environmental, import/export, and labor regulations; and

  (d) in accordance with generally accepted industry standards for comparable manufacturing and service engagements.

2.4 **Manufacturing Capacity and Forecasts.**  
Contoso shall provide Titan with rolling, good-faith non-binding forecasts of anticipated demand (e.g., three-, six-, or twelve-month horizons as specified in the SOW). Titan shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reserve manufacturing capacity to meet such forecasts. To the extent an SOW specifies forecast commitment levels (e.g., minimum order quantities, capacity reservations, or liability for excess or obsolete inventory), such provisions shall govern and may entitle Titan to compensation for unused capacity or excess material as further described in Article III.

2.5 **Orders and Acceptance.**  
Contoso shall issue POs to Titan referencing this Agreement and the applicable SOW. Each PO shall specify item numbers, quantities, pricing, requested delivery dates, ship-to addresses, and other relevant information. Titan shall confirm acceptance of each PO in writing (including electronic means) within five (5) Business Days of receipt. Failure by Titan to confirm a PO within such period shall not be deemed acceptance; Titan must affirmatively accept POs. Titan may reject any PO that materially conflicts with this Agreement or the SOW, provided such rejection is communicated to Contoso in writing with a reasonable explanation.

2.6 **Delivery; Title and Risk of Loss.**  
Unless otherwise stated in an SOW, Deliverables shall be shipped **FOB Titan’s facility (Incoterms 2020)**. Title and risk of loss to the Deliverables shall pass to Contoso upon Titan’s delivery of the Deliverables to the carrier at Titan’s shipping location. Contoso shall be responsible for freight, insurance in transit, customs, duties, and taxes related to transportation, unless otherwise specified in an SOW.

2.7 **Inspection and Acceptance of Deliverables.**  
Contoso shall have a period of **thirty (30) days** from receipt of each shipment of Deliverables (the “**Inspection Period**”) to inspect such Deliverables for conformity with the Specifications and applicable PO. If Contoso does not notify Titan in writing of any nonconformity within the Inspection Period, the Deliverables shall be deemed accepted. If Contoso reasonably rejects Deliverables due to nonconformity, Titan shall, as Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy (subject to Article IX), at Titan’s option, either (a) repair or replace the nonconforming Deliverables, or (b) credit or refund the purchase price of such nonconforming Deliverables, provided such Deliverables are returned to Titan in accordance with Titan’s return material authorization (“RMA”) instructions.

2.8 **Service Locations.**  
Titan will perform Services at its own facilities or at other locations as listed in the applicable SOW. Any Services performed at Contoso’s premises shall be subject to Contoso’s reasonable facility rules and safety policies communicated in advance, provided that such rules do not unreasonably interfere with Titan’s performance or conflict with this Agreement.

2.9 **Subcontractors.**  
Titan may engage subcontractors to perform portions of the Services, provided that Titan remains fully responsible for the acts and omissions of its subcontractors as if they were Titan’s own. Titan shall ensure that any subcontractors performing material portions of the Services are bound by obligations of confidentiality and data protection no less protective than those imposed on Titan under this Agreement.

2.10 **High-Risk Nature of Engagement.**  
The Parties acknowledge the high-risk nature of the Deliverables and Services, given their potential use in mission-critical industrial environments. Contoso further acknowledges that the pricing and commitments reflected in this Agreement, including the Contract Value of US$3,754,388, are premised upon the risk allocations, indemnities, warranty limitations, and liability provisions herein, which are more favorable to Titan than Contoso could obtain under lower-risk engagements.

## ARTICLE III  
FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Contract Value.**  
The Parties estimate that the aggregate value of all Services and Deliverables to be ordered under this Agreement during the Term shall be approximately **US$3,754,388** (the “**Contract Value**”). This Contract Value is an estimate only and does not constitute a minimum purchase commitment by Contoso unless expressly specified in an SOW. Actual amounts payable shall be based on POs issued by Contoso and accepted by Titan, plus any other fees, charges, and reimbursable expenses as set forth in this Agreement and the applicable SOWs.

3.2 **Pricing and Fee Schedule.**  
The pricing for Deliverables and Services shall be as set forth in the SOW(s) and/or attached pricing schedules. Such pricing may include, without limitation:

  (a) **Unit Prices** for each type of Deliverable, based on volume tiers or other agreed parameters;

  (b) **NRE (Non-Recurring Engineering) Fees** for initial tooling, test fixtures, process development, and other one-time costs;

  (c) **Service Fees** for engineering support, after-sales services, or other labor-based activities, billed on a time-and-materials basis or fixed-fee basis as specified; and

  (d) **Surcharges or Adjustments** for expedited orders, small-lot production, or extraordinary materials handling, as mutually agreed in an SOW or Change Order.

3.3 **Payment Terms.**  
Unless otherwise specified in an SOW, Titan shall invoice Contoso upon shipment of Deliverables or completion of the applicable Services milestone. All undisputed amounts shall be due and payable within **sixty (60) days** from the date of Contoso’s receipt of a valid invoice (“**Net 60**”). Payment shall be made in U.S. Dollars by wire transfer or other mutually agreed method.

3.4 **Milestone Payments.**  
For significant projects or NRE work, the Parties may agree to milestone-based payments as specified in the SOW. Each milestone invoice shall be payable on Net 60 terms following achievement of the applicable milestone and submission of a valid invoice.

3.5 **Late Payments.**  
Any undisputed invoice amount not paid when due shall accrue interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law, whichever is lower, from the due date until paid in full. Titan may, upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Contoso and without liability to Contoso, suspend deliveries or performance of Services if Contoso fails to pay undisputed amounts within thirty (30) days after written notice of non-payment, until all overdue amounts and applicable interest are paid in full.

3.6 **Disputed Amounts.**  
If Contoso disputes any portion of an invoice, Contoso shall notify Titan in writing within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the invoice, specifying the reasons for the dispute. Contoso shall pay all undisputed portions of the invoice in accordance with Section 3.3. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve the disputed amounts promptly. Failure by Contoso to timely dispute an invoice shall be deemed acceptance of such invoice.

3.7 **Taxes.**  
All fees and prices are exclusive of federal, state, local, and foreign taxes, duties, levies, and similar governmental charges (collectively, “**Taxes**”). Contoso shall be responsible for all applicable Taxes arising from or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, excluding Taxes based on Titan’s net income or employment-related Taxes. If Titan is required to collect Taxes from Contoso, Titan shall include such Taxes on its invoices, and Contoso shall pay such amounts unless Contoso provides a valid exemption certificate.

3.8 **Expenses and Reimbursements.**  
To the extent specifically authorized in an SOW or otherwise approved in writing by Contoso in advance, Contoso shall reimburse Titan for reasonable and actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing the Services (e.g., travel, lodging, meals, special shipping). Titan shall provide appropriate documentation of such expenses with its invoices.

3.9 **Inventory and Cancellation Charges.**  
To the extent an SOW includes provisions related to forecast-based procurement, minimum order quantities, or long-lead-time components, and Contoso cancels or reduces orders in a manner that leaves Titan with excess or obsolete inventory procured specifically for Contoso, Contoso shall reimburse Titan for: (a) Titan’s documented cost of such inventory, plus (b) a reasonable handling and restocking fee not to exceed ten percent (10%) of such cost, provided Titan uses commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such losses. Any such reimbursement shall be invoiced and payable under the Net 60 terms.

Given the high-risk nature of the engagement and the allocation of risk agreed by the Parties, Contoso shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Titan and its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (collectively, “**Titan Indemnitees**”) from and against any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from any Third-Party Claim to the extent based on:  

  (a) Contoso’s use, resale, integration, or deployment of the Deliverables, including any claims relating to Contoso’s products into which the Deliverables are incorporated, except to the extent such claims are expressly assumed by Titan under Section 8.1;

  (b) any allegation that the Specifications or Contoso IP infringe or misappropriate any IP rights of a third party;

  (c) Contoso’s violation of Applicable Law related to its business, products, or use of the Deliverables; or

  (d) Contoso’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

8.3 **Indemnification Procedures.**  
The Party seeking indemnification (the “**Indemnified Party**”) shall: (a) promptly notify the other Party (the “**Indemnifying Party**”) in writing of any Third-Party Claim for which indemnity is sought, provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent it is materially prejudiced thereby; (b) grant the Indemnifying Party sole control of the defense and settlement of the Third-Party Claim; and (c) provide the Indemnifying Party with all reasonable cooperation and assistance, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense. The Indemnified Party may participate in the defense of the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its own choosing at its own expense. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Third-Party Claim that imposes any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party (other than payment of amounts indemnified hereunder) without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

8.4 **Infringement Remedies.**  
If any Deliverable is, or in Titan’s reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of a third-party IP infringement claim, Titan may, at its option and expense: (a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using such Deliverable; (b) modify the Deliverable so that it becomes non-infringing while retaining substantially equivalent functionality; or (c) replace the Deliverable with a non-infringing product of substantially equivalent functionality. If none of the foregoing options is commercially reasonable, Titan may terminate the affected Deliverable or SOW and refund to Contoso the amounts paid for the affected Deliverables, less a reasonable allowance for use.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.**  
Titan shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso and solely for the purpose of performing the Services, except where otherwise required by Applicable Law.

In the event of a confirmed Personal Data breach affecting Personal Data processed by Titan on behalf of Contoso, Titan shall notify Contoso without undue delay (and in no event later than seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the breach) and provide available information regarding the nature of the breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects affected, and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach.

Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement or upon Contoso’s written request, Titan shall, at Contoso’s option, delete or return all Personal Data processed on Contoso’s behalf, except to the extent Titan is required by Applicable Law to retain such data.

12.4 **Service Level Credits.**  
If Titan fails to meet the uptime or response time Service Levels for any calendar month in a material and repeated manner, Contoso may be entitled to service credits as specified in the applicable SOW.
