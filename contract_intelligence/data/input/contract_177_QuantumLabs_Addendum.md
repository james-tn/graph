### 9.3 Exceptions to Limitations

The Addendum Liability Cap and the exclusion of consequential damages in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 of this Addendum shall **not** apply to:

- A Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under **Article V** of the Parent Agreement, Existing SOW, or this Addendum;  
- A Party’s breach of its data protection and privacy obligations under **Article XI** of the Parent Agreement, Existing SOW, or this Addendum;  
- A Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII** of the Parent Agreement and Existing SOW with respect to third‑party claims arising from this Addendum; or  
- Quantum Labs’ liability for its gross negligence or willful misconduct, to the extent such limitations are not permitted by applicable law.

In such cases, liability shall still be subject to any non‑waivable legal limitations imposed by applicable law.
