## ARTICLE III  
## FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Contract Value.** In consideration for the Services and Deliverables provided under this Addendum, Client shall pay to Vendor fees in the total amount of **USD $2,794,462** (the "**Contract Value**"), subject to adjustment pursuant to Article XIII and any agreed Change Orders.

3.2 **Fee Structure.** Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the Contract Value shall be allocated as follows:

  3.2.1 **Phase 1 (Discovery & Design):** USD $279,446.20 (10% of the Contract Value);  

  3.2.2 **Phase 2 (Build & Integration):** USD $1,117,784.80 (40% of the Contract Value);  

  3.2.3 **Phase 3 (UAT Support):** USD $418,? (approx; but keep consistent)  

  Let us specify precisely for internal consistency:  
  - 10% Phase 1 = $279,446.20  
  - 40% Phase 2 = $1,117,784.80  
  - 15% Phase 3 = $419,169.30  
  - 15% Phase 4 = $419,169.30  
  - 20% Phase 5 = $558,?; calculate: 0.2 × 2,794,462 = 558,892.40  

  3.2.3 **Phase 3 (UAT Support):** USD $419,169.30 (15% of the Contract Value);  

  3.2.4 **Phase 4 (Production Deployment):** USD $419,169.30 (15% of the Contract Value); and  

  3.2.5 **Phase 5 (Operational Support & Optimization):** USD $558,892.40 (20% of the Contract Value).

Any undisputed portion of an invoice shall be paid in accordance with this Section 3.4.

3.5 **Late Payment.** Any undisputed invoice amount not paid when due shall accrue interest at a rate of:

  3.5.2 interest shall accrue from the due date until the date of actual payment, whether before or after judgment.  

Vendor shall also be entitled to recover from Client reasonable costs of collection, including legal fees, incurred in connection with materially overdue payments. Persistent non-payment may give rise to suspension rights under Section 4.4.

## ARTICLE VIII  
## INDEMNIFICATION

8.1 **Client Indemnity in Favor of Vendor.** In view of the high-risk nature of the engagement, Client shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Vendor, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and subcontractors (collectively, "**Vendor Indemnitees**") from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, proceedings, damages, losses, liabilities, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and court costs) (collectively, "**Losses**") arising out of or relating to:

  8.1.1 Client’s breach of this Addendum, the Master Agreement, or Applicable Law;  

  8.1.2 any claim that the Client Data, when used as permitted hereunder, infringes the intellectual property or other rights of any third party or violates any Data Protection Laws, except to the extent caused by Vendor’s breach of Article XI;  

  8.1.3 Client’s misuse or unauthorized use of the Deliverables or Services, including use contrary to Vendor’s documentation or instructions; or  

  8.1.4 any claim asserted by a third party against Vendor arising from Client’s products, services, or business decisions made in reliance upon the Deliverables or Services.

8.2 **Vendor Indemnity in Favor of Client.** Vendor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Client and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, and employees ("**Client Indemnitees**") from and against any Losses arising out of or relating to any third-party claim that the Deliverables, as provided by Vendor and used by Client in accordance with this Addendum, infringe any Intellectual Property Rights of such third party in the United Kingdom. Vendor’s obligations under this Section 8.2 shall not apply to the extent the alleged infringement arises from:

  8.2.1 any modification of the Deliverables not made or authorized in writing by Vendor;  

  8.2.2 combination or use of the Deliverables with any data, software, or systems not provided by Vendor, where such infringement would not have arisen but for such combination;  

  8.2.3 Client Data; or  

  8.2.4 Client’s failure to implement a modification or update provided by Vendor that would have avoided the alleged infringement without material loss of functionality.

8.3 **Mitigation Measures.** In the event that the Deliverables are, or in Vendor’s reasonable opinion are likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, Vendor may, at its option and expense:

  8.3.1 procure for Client the right to continue using the Deliverables;  

  8.3.2 modify the Deliverables so that they are non-infringing while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or  

  8.3.3 replace the Deliverables with non-infringing products or services of substantially equivalent functionality.  

If none of the above options is commercially reasonable, Vendor may terminate the affected Services or Deliverables and refund to Client the pro-rata portion of any prepaid fees for the period following the effective date of termination.

8.4 **Indemnification Procedure.** A Party seeking indemnification ("**Indemnified Party**") shall:

  8.4.1 promptly notify the other Party ("**Indemnifying Party**") in writing of any claim for which indemnification is sought, provided that failure to provide prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent materially prejudiced thereby;  

  8.4.2 permit the Indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of such claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim that imposes any admission, liability, or non-monetary obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and  

  8.4.3 provide the Indemnifying Party with reasonable assistance, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defense and settlement of the claim.

8.5 **Exclusive Remedy.** The indemnification obligations in this Article VIII set forth the Indemnifying Party’s entire liability and the Indemnified Party’s exclusive remedy with respect to third-party claims described herein, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available for breach of contract or under Applicable Law.

Each Party assumes full and unlimited liability for its obligations as set forth herein, subject only to Applicable Law.

  9.2.2 the usual exclusion of consequential damages is hereby **disapplied**.

9.3 **Mandatory Limitations.** Nothing in this Addendum shall exclude or limit either Party’s liability:

  9.3.1 for death or personal injury caused by its negligence;  

  9.3.2 for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;

## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Role of the Parties.** For the purposes of Data Protection Laws, Client shall be deemed the **controller** (or equivalent term under applicable law) of Personal Data contained in Client Data, and Vendor shall be deemed the **processor** (or equivalent term) processing such Personal Data on behalf of Client.

11.2 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in the performance of its obligations under this Addendum.

  11.4.1 Vendor imposes on such sub-processors written obligations substantially similar to those set out in this Article XI; and

  11.6.1 ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage;

  11.7.2 provide Client with sufficient information to enable Client to meet any obligations to report or inform data subjects or regulators of the breach; and

Deletion shall be performed in accordance with industry-standard secure deletion practices.

11.10 **Audit Rights.** Upon at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, and no more than once in any twelve (12) month period (except following a security breach), Client may audit Vendor’s compliance with this Article XI, either by means of Vendor-provided audit reports (such as SOC 2, ISO27001 certificates) or by an on-site audit conducted by Client or a mutually agreed independent auditor, subject to reasonable confidentiality and security obligations. Such audits shall be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with Vendor’s business operations.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS
