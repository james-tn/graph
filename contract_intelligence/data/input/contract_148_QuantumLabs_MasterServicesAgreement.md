While Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts and professional skill and care consistent with generally accepted industry standards to achieve the objectives stated in the SOWs, the Parties agree that certain outcomes may be inherently uncertain and may be based on experimental methodologies.

2.2 **Types of Services.**  

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Services may include:

(a) **Research and Development Services.**  
Designing, conducting and documenting R&D projects, including feasibility studies, proof-of-concept development, algorithmic experimentation, and technology evaluations in accordance with specifications in the applicable SOW.

(b) **Data Analytics and Modeling.**  
Ingestion, cleansing, transformation and analysis of Client Data and other datasets; development and tuning of statistical models and machine learning algorithms; generation of analytical reports, dashboards and visualizations; and recommendations for business optimization.

(c) **Software Development and Integration.**  
Design, development, configuration, and testing of software components, APIs, tools, or platform features; integration with Client’s existing systems; and preparation of technical documentation, user guides, or runbooks.

(d) **Platform Access and Managed Services.**  
Provision of access to Vendor-managed platforms, environments and tools, including staging and production environments, subject to Service Levels specified in **Article XII** and relevant SOWs; ongoing monitoring, incident management, maintenance, and enhancement services.

(e) **Consulting and Advisory Services.**  
Strategic consulting, architecture review, technology roadmap development, training sessions, workshops, and similar professional services aimed at assisting Client in leveraging the Deliverables and Vendor’s technologies.

2.3 **Deliverables.**  

(a) Each SOW shall clearly define the Deliverables, including format (e.g., code repositories, documents, presentations, data files), level of detail, and any related documentation.

(b) Vendor shall deliver the Deliverables in accordance with the timelines and milestones set forth in the applicable SOW. Time is of the essence only where explicitly stated in the SOW. Unless otherwise specified, delivery shall be deemed completed when the Deliverables are made available electronically to Client (e.g., via secure file transfer, shared repository, or Vendor’s platform).

(c) Client acknowledges that certain Deliverables, including prototype models, may depend on third-party tools, platforms or data, and that continued operation of such Deliverables may be subject to third-party license terms and availability.

2.4 **Performance Standards.**  

(a) Vendor shall perform the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner, exercising the degree of skill and care ordinarily exercised by similarly-situated service providers performing similar services. Vendor shall assign qualified personnel with appropriate skills and experience, and may use subcontractors as permitted under **Section 16.10**, provided Vendor remains responsible for all subcontractors’ acts and omissions.

(b) Vendor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in performing the Services, including Data Protection Laws as addressed in **Article XI**.

(c) Where Service Levels are specified, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet or exceed such Service Levels, subject to the exclusions and limitations in **Article XII** and any SOW.

2.5 **Client Responsibilities.**  

(a) Client shall provide Vendor with timely access to Client personnel, systems, environments, and Client Data, as reasonably necessary for Vendor to perform the Services. Client shall ensure that all such access is provided in a secure manner and in accordance with Client’s policies, which shall be communicated to Vendor in advance.

(b) Client shall be responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and legality of all Client Data provided to Vendor. Vendor is entitled to rely on information and instructions provided by Client or its designated representatives without independently verifying their accuracy.

(c) Client shall promptly review Deliverables and provide feedback, approvals, or acceptance in accordance with **Section 2.6**. Any delays by Client in providing access, information, or approvals may impact timelines and Fees, and Vendor shall be entitled to schedule adjustments and additional Fees as set forth in the applicable SOW and **Article XIII**.

2.6 **Acceptance of Deliverables.**  

(a) Each SOW shall set forth acceptance criteria and procedures. In the absence of specific criteria, Deliverables shall be deemed accepted if they substantially conform to the specifications in the SOW.

(b) Upon delivery, Client shall have the review period specified in the SOW, or, if none is specified, ten (10) Business Days, to notify Vendor in writing of any material non-conformities. If Client does not provide such notice within the applicable review period, the Deliverables shall be deemed accepted.

(c) If Client timely notifies Vendor of material non-conformities, Vendor shall, at its own cost and expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to correct such non-conformities within a reasonable period. Following correction, Client shall have a subsequent review period (of equal length to the original review period) to confirm acceptance. If the Deliverables continue not to conform materially after at least two (2) correction attempts, Client may, as its exclusive remedy, either (i) accept the Deliverables “as-is” with an equitable reduction in Fees (to be agreed in good faith), or (ii) reject the Deliverables, in which case Client shall be relieved from paying any Fees specifically attributable to the rejected Deliverables.

2.7 **Non-Exclusivity.**  

Unless expressly stated otherwise in an SOW, the relationship between the Parties is non-exclusive. Vendor may provide similar services to other clients, including competitors of Client, provided Vendor complies with its obligations under **Article V (Confidentiality)** and **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)**.

(b) If Client is required to withhold any Taxes from payments to Vendor, Client shall: (i) deduct such Taxes from the amount owed; (ii) pay the Taxes to the appropriate tax authority; and (iii) provide Vendor with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation.

Any undisputed amount not paid when due shall accrue interest at a rate of **one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month**, or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is lower, from the due date until the date of payment.

Without limiting **Section 9.1**, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, in view of the experimental and high-risk nature of the Services and the Contract Value of **US$4,225,077**, it is commercially reasonable that liability shall not be contractually capped and that all damages legally recoverable under applicable law may be pursued, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the indemnity allocations in **Article VIII**.

9.4 **Essential Basis.**  

The Parties acknowledge that the allocation of risk in this **Article IX** is an essential basis of the bargain between the Parties and that, in the absence of such allocation, the economic terms of this Agreement would be substantially different.
