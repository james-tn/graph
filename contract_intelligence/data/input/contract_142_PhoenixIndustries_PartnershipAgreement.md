8.4 **Infringement Remedies.**  
If any Work Product or Services are, or in Phoenix’s reasonable opinion are likely to be, the subject of an infringement Claim, Phoenix may, at its option and expense:
  - (a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using such Work Product or Services;  
  - (b) replace or modify such Work Product or Services so that they become non-infringing while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or  
  - (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected SOW and refund to Contoso the portion of fees pre-paid for the infringing Work Product or Services that relate to the period following such termination.

8.5 **Exclusions.**  
Phoenix shall have no obligation under Section 8.1(b) with respect to any Claim to the extent such Claim arises from:
  - (a) modifications to the Work Product made by anyone other than Phoenix or at Contoso’s direction;  
  - (b) combination of the Work Product with products, services, or data not provided or approved by Phoenix;  
  - (c) compliance with specifications, designs, or instructions provided by Contoso; or  
  - (d) Contoso’s use of the Work Product after Phoenix notifies Contoso of alleged or actual infringement and provides a non-infringing alternative.

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its performance or use of the Services under this Agreement.

11.3 **Subprocessors.**  
Phoenix may engage Approved Subcontractors as subprocessors to process Personal Data, provided that:
  - (a) Phoenix enters into a written agreement with each subprocessor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Article XI; and

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (“Dispute”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiations between their respective project managers.

If the Dispute is not resolved by mediation within sixty (60) days after the appointment of the mediator, either Party may pursue its rights in a court of competent jurisdiction as provided in Section 16.3.

14.4 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in order to prevent or stop any actual or threatened breach of its Intellectual Property Rights or Confidentiality obligations, without first complying with the negotiation or mediation procedures in this Article XIV.
