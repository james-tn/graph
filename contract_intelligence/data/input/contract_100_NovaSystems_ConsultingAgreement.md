  2.7.3 If Client reasonably determines that the Deliverable materially fails to conform, Client shall provide Vendor with a written notice describing the non-conformities in reasonable detail. Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct such non-conformities and re-deliver the Deliverable for further review.

  2.7.4 If Client does not provide written notice of non-conformity within the applicable review period, the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted as of the last day of such period.

2.8 **Subcontractors.** Vendor may engage subcontractors and Affiliates to perform portions of the Services, provided that Vendor remains responsible for the performance of such subcontractors and for compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Vendor shall ensure that any such subcontractors are bound by obligations of confidentiality and data protection substantially similar to those set forth in Articles V and XI.
