Ownership and IP treatment of Additional Deliverables shall be governed by **Article VI** of the Original SOW as modified by **Article VI of this Amendment**.

2.5 **Detailed Description of Extended Services (Summary).**  

2.5.1 **Transition and Hand-Over to Managed Operations.**  
The Vendor shall plan and execute a structured Transition Period from Hypercare (Phase 6) to Managed Operations (Phase 8), including:

The acceptance procedures in Section 2.8 of the Original SOW (10 Business Day review, notice of non-conformity, correction, and deemed acceptance if no response following reminder) shall apply to the Additional Deliverables AD1–AD6 and to any other Deliverables produced under this Amendment, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

The Vendor reaffirms its warranties under Section 7.2 of the Original SOW and further warrants that:

## ARTICLE VIII – INDEMNIFICATION (AMENDED – HIGH RISK PROFILE)

8.1 **Vendor Indemnification.**  

The Vendor’s indemnification obligations under Section 8.1 of the Original SOW remain in effect with respect to Extended Services and Additional Deliverables, including indemnification for:

- third-party Intellectual Property infringement claims arising from the Services or Deliverables (excluding Client Materials and Client instructions);  
- claims arising from the Vendor’s gross negligence or wilful misconduct; and  
- claims relating to the Vendor’s breach of confidentiality or data protection obligations.

8.2 **Client Indemnification (Broadened).**  

In addition to the indemnification obligations in Section 8.2 of the Original SOW, the Client shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Vendor and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all Losses arising out of or in connection with:

- Client’s misuse of the Extended Services or Additional Deliverables;

The procedures set out in Section 8.3 of the Original SOW (prompt notice, control of defence, cooperation, and mitigation) apply to indemnification claims under this Amendment.

---

## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (AMENDED – HIGH RISK, UNCAPPED)

9.1 **No Overall Cap on Liability.**  

Notwithstanding **Article IX** of the Original SOW, including Section 9.2 which caps aggregate liability at two (2) times the total Fees under the SOW (and the increased five (5) times cap under Section 9.2 of the Original SOW), the Parties agree that, **with respect to claims arising solely out of or in connection with this Amendment and the Extended Services**, there shall be **no contractual cap on liability** for either Party, subject only to Applicable Law.

9.2 **Consequential and Indirect Damages.**  

In light of the High Risk Profile, the exclusion of certain damages in Section 9.1 of the Original SOW is modified such that:

- **consequential, incidental, and indirect damages, including lost profits, loss of data, and business interruption, shall not be excluded** as between the Parties for claims relating to this Amendment; and  
- the Parties acknowledge that such damages were reasonably foreseeable at the time of entering into this Amendment, given the criticality of the Extended Services and the Client’s reliance thereon.

9.3 **Exceptions and Non-Excludable Liability.**  

Any statutory limitations on exclusion of liability under Applicable Law continue to apply. For clarity, nothing in this Amendment shall limit or exclude liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any liability that cannot be excluded under Applicable Law.

9.4 **Aggregation of Claims.**  

Multiple or related claims arising under this Amendment may be aggregated for purposes of determining liability, but there is no monetary cap. Section 9.4 of the Original SOW is superseded solely to the extent it purports to impose an aggregate cap.

---

## ARTICLE X – INSURANCE

10.1 **Insurance Requirements.**  

The Vendor shall maintain insurance coverage at least equivalent to that required under Article X of the Original SOW (Professional Indemnity, Public/General Liability, Cyber and Data Security Liability) throughout the Extended SOW Term and for twelve (12) months thereafter, with limits reflective of the High Risk Profile and the uncapped liability under Article IX of this Amendment.

10.2 **Evidence of Insurance.**  

Upon reasonable request by the Client, the Vendor shall provide certificates of insurance or other evidence of coverage, as contemplated in Section 10.2 of the Original SOW.

10.3 **No Limitation.**  

The existence of insurance does not limit the Vendor’s or Client’s liability except as expressly permitted under Applicable Law and as may be stated in the relevant policy.

---

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  

The Parties reaffirm their obligations under Article XI of the Original SOW, including compliance with UK GDPR, EU GDPR (where applicable), and analogous data protection laws, as well as any Data Processing Addendum (DPA) executed pursuant to Section 11.3 of the Original SOW.

11.2 **Processing under Extended Services.**  

To the extent the Vendor Processes Client Personal Data in providing Extended Services, the Client remains the controller and the Vendor the processor, as set out in Section 11.2 of the Original SOW. The scope and nature of Processing may be expanded by this Amendment and shall be reflected in an updated DPA, if necessary.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  

The Vendor shall maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with Section 11.4 of the Original SOW, and such measures shall be commensurate with the extended processing operations and the sensitivity of data involved in Extended Services and Additional Deliverables.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.**  

In the event of a Security Incident or Data Breach affecting Client Personal Data in connection with Extended Services, the Vendor shall notify the Client without undue delay and cooperate as required by Section 11.5 of the Original SOW and any applicable DPA.

12.2 **Uptime Commitment.**  

For any hosted, managed, or monitored components directly operated by the Vendor as part of Extended Services, the Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain an uptime of at least **99.9% per calendar month**, excluding scheduled maintenance and outages attributable to the Client, third parties, or Force Majeure Events.

12.4.2 SLA Credits shall be the Client’s primary monetary remedy for SLA breaches but shall not limit the Client’s broader rights and remedies under the High Risk Profile, including claims for consequential damages under Article IX of this Amendment.

12.5 **Reporting.**  

The Vendor shall provide regular SLA performance reports through the Managed Operations Dashboard (AD5) and other agreed mechanisms, enabling the Client to monitor compliance and request SLA Credits where applicable.

At the Client’s written request, the Vendor may commence interim work on a Change Request prior to formal execution of a Change Order, under Section 13.4 of the Original SOW, provided scope and applicable rates have been agreed in writing (email sufficient).

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION
