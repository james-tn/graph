Each SOW shall define in detail the scope, specifications, and requirements for the Services and Deliverables applicable to a particular project or engagement.

2.2 **Initial Scope of Work.**  
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the initial scope of work under this Agreement shall include the following phases, each of which may be detailed further in an SOW:

  2.2.1 **Discovery and Requirements Gathering.**  
  Vanguard shall conduct discovery sessions with Contoso’s designated stakeholders to gather and document business requirements, current-state system architecture, data flows, integration points, and performance expectations. Vanguard shall prepare a Requirements Specification Document summarizing such findings and recommendations. This document shall be treated as a Deliverable subject to Contoso’s review and acceptance as set forth in Section 2.6.

  2.2.2 **Solution Design and Architecture.**  
  Based on the approved Requirements Specification Document, Vanguard shall design a target-state solution architecture, including system components, integration mechanisms, data models, security framework, and operational procedures. Vanguard shall deliver a Solution Design Document describing the proposed architecture, technology stack, and implementation approach, including any dependencies on Third-Party Materials. Vanguard shall incorporate Contoso’s feedback in good faith and shall not materially deviate from the approved design without Contoso’s prior written approval pursuant to Article XIII.

  2.2.3 **Implementation, Configuration, and Integration.**  
  Vanguard shall implement and configure the solution consistent with the Solution Design Document and Applicable Laws, including the integration of agreed third-party systems and data sources. Vanguard shall adhere to industry best practices and Contoso’s then-current security and IT policies, as provided to Vanguard in writing. Vanguard shall perform unit testing, integration testing, and system testing prior to presenting the solution to Contoso for User Acceptance Testing (“**UAT**”).

  2.2.4 **Testing and Acceptance Support.**  
  Vanguard shall support Contoso during UAT by preparing test plans, test scripts, and expected results for review and approval by Contoso. Vanguard shall log and track defects identified during UAT, remediate issues in a timely manner, and provide updated builds or configurations for retesting. Acceptance criteria for each Deliverable and milestone shall be defined in the applicable SOW, and the acceptance process shall follow Section 2.6.

  2.2.5 **Deployment, Training, and Knowledge Transfer.**  
  Following successful completion of UAT and acceptance by Contoso, Vanguard shall support the deployment of the solution to the agreed production environment. Vanguard shall provide training sessions and training materials for Contoso’s personnel, including administrators, business users, and support staff as applicable. Vanguard shall perform knowledge transfer to Contoso’s designated personnel, including documentation of key operational procedures, known limitations, and escalation paths.

  2.2.6 **Ongoing Support and Managed Services.**  
  Subject to the terms and Fees set forth in the applicable SOW, Vanguard shall provide ongoing support and managed services for the solution, including incident management, problem resolution, routine maintenance, performance monitoring, and periodic reporting of system health and SLA performance.

2.3 **Performance Standards.**  
Vanguard shall perform the Services:  
(a) in a professional and workmanlike manner, consistent with generally accepted industry standards for similar services;  
(b) in compliance with this Agreement, the applicable SOW, and all Applicable Laws; and  
(c) in accordance with the service levels specified in Article XII. Vanguard shall maintain sufficient personnel, resources, and technical expertise to meet or exceed the performance standards and SLA commitments.  

If Vanguard fails to perform the Services in accordance with this Section 2.3, Vanguard shall, at its own cost and expense and as Contoso’s exclusive remedy for such nonconforming Services (subject to Article IX), promptly re-perform the affected Services to bring them into conformity, provided that Contoso notifies Vanguard of the nonconformity within a reasonable period after discovery.

2.4 **Timeline and Milestones.**  
Each SOW shall include a detailed project plan or schedule that sets forth the timelines, milestones, dependencies, and key dates applicable to the Services and Deliverables. Vanguard shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet all agreed timelines and milestones. If Vanguard becomes aware of any actual or potential delay, Vanguard shall promptly notify Contoso in writing, describing: (a) the nature and cause of the delay; (b) the potential impact on the project schedule; and (c) the remedial actions Vanguard proposes to undertake. Any material change to the schedule or milestones shall be handled pursuant to Article XIII (Change Management).

2.5 **Project Management; Status Reporting.**  
Vanguard shall designate a project manager who shall serve as Vanguard’s primary point of contact for Contoso. Contoso shall likewise designate a project manager. Vanguard shall provide periodic status reports as specified in the SOW, which may include updates on progress, completed tasks, open issues, risk assessments, and upcoming milestones. The Parties’ project managers shall meet (in person or via teleconference) at a frequency agreed in the SOW to review progress and address issues.

2.6 **Deliverable Review and Acceptance.**  

  2.6.1 **Submission.** Vanguard shall submit each Deliverable to Contoso in accordance with the applicable SOW. Each Deliverable shall be delivered in the format and by the method specified in the SOW.

  2.6.2 **Review Period.** Unless otherwise specified in the applicable SOW, Contoso shall have fifteen (15) Business Days (the “**Review Period**”) from receipt of each Deliverable to review and either: (a) accept the Deliverable in writing; or (b) reject the Deliverable in writing, specifying in reasonable detail any nonconformity with the applicable requirements, specifications, or acceptance criteria.

  2.6.3 **Deemed Acceptance.** If Contoso does not provide written acceptance or a written rejection within the Review Period, the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted; provided, however, that Vanguard provided the Deliverable to the correct Contoso contact and clearly identified it as being submitted for acceptance.

  2.6.4 **Correction and Resubmission.** If Contoso rejects a Deliverable, Vanguard shall, at no additional cost to Contoso, promptly correct the deficiencies identified by Contoso and resubmit the Deliverable. Contoso shall have an additional Review Period for each resubmitted Deliverable. If, after two (2) resubmissions, the Deliverable continues to fail to meet the applicable acceptance criteria, Contoso may, at its option and in addition to its other rights and remedies: (i) accept the Deliverable with a mutually agreed reduction in Fees; or (ii) treat such failure as a material breach and pursue its rights under Section 4.3 (Termination for Cause).

2.7 **Subcontracting.**  
Vanguard may not subcontract any material portion of the Services without Contoso’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Vanguard shall remain fully responsible and liable for the acts and omissions of its Subcontractors as if performed by Vanguard itself, and shall ensure that each Subcontractor is bound by confidentiality, data protection, and security obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement.

2.8 **Cooperation by Contoso.**  
Contoso shall provide Vanguard with access to relevant systems, facilities, personnel, and information reasonably necessary for Vanguard to perform the Services, subject to Contoso’s security and access policies. Vanguard’s performance is dependent upon such cooperation, and Vanguard shall not be liable for delays or failures to the extent caused by Contoso’s failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Laws relating to data protection, privacy, and information security, including, as applicable, GDPR, CCPA, and other similar laws. To the extent Vanguard processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso, Vanguard shall be deemed a “processor” or “service provider” and Contoso a “controller” or “business,” as those terms are defined under Applicable Law.

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.**  
Vanguard shall process Personal Data solely on documented instructions from Contoso, as set forth in this Agreement, the applicable SOW, or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties.

At a minimum, such measures shall include access controls, encryption (in transit and at rest where appropriate), vulnerability management, and incident response procedures.

11.4 **Subprocessors.**  
Vanguard shall not engage any Subcontractor to process Personal Data without Contoso’s prior written consent. Where Contoso has approved a Subcontractor, Vanguard shall ensure that such Subcontractor is bound by written contractual obligations that are no less protective of Personal Data than the obligations imposed on Vanguard under this Article XI.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of any confirmed unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personal Data or Client Data in Vanguard’s possession or control that results in actual or likely compromise of such data (a “**Data Breach**”), Vanguard shall:

  (a) notify Contoso in writing without undue delay and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  

  (b) provide Contoso with reasonably detailed information regarding the nature and scope of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records concerned, the likely consequences of the Data Breach, and the measures taken or proposed to be taken to mitigate its possible adverse effects; and  

  (c) cooperate with Contoso in investigating, containing, and remediating the Data Breach, and in any notifications to affected individuals or regulators that Contoso reasonably determines are required by Applicable Law.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.**  
To the extent feasible and permitted by Applicable Law, Vanguard shall assist Contoso, at Contoso’s expense (on a reasonable T&M basis), in fulfilling Contoso’s obligations to respond to requests from data subjects to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, or exercise other rights under applicable data protection laws, where such requests relate to Personal Data processed by Vanguard.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Vanguard shall retain Personal Data and Client Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon Contoso’s written request or upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Vanguard shall promptly delete or return all Personal Data and Client Data in its possession or control, except where retention is required by law.

12.1 **Service Availability.**  
For any managed or hosted Services provided under this Agreement, Vanguard shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the production environment is available at least 99.9% of the time during each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance windows and permitted downtime (“**Service Availability Commitment**”).

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  
Vanguard may schedule maintenance windows during which the Services may be unavailable, provided that Vanguard shall give Contoso at least five (5) Business Days’ prior notice of any planned maintenance that is expected to cause material service disruption, and shall schedule such maintenance outside of Contoso’s core business hours where reasonably practicable.

12.3 **Incident Response Times.**  
Vanguard shall respond to incidents in accordance with the following target response times, measured from the time Vanguard is notified of the incident:

- **Severity 1 (Critical):** System down or major function unavailable to a significant portion of users, with no workaround. Initial response within one (1) hour; continuous work until workaround or resolution is provided.  
- **Severity 2 (High):** Major functionality impaired, impacting business operations, but workaround exists. Initial response within four (4) hours; work until resolution or acceptable workaround.  
- **Severity 3 (Medium):** Non-critical functionality impaired, limited business impact. Initial response within one (1) Business Day.  
- **Severity 4 (Low):** Minor issues, cosmetic defects, or general inquiries. Initial response within two (2) Business Days.

12.4 **SLA Credits.**  
If Vanguard fails to meet the Service Availability Commitment in a given calendar month (excluding permitted downtime), Contoso shall be entitled to service credits as follows:

- Service availability between 99.0% and 99.9%: credit equal to 5% of the monthly Fees for the affected Services;  
- Service availability between 98.0% and 99.0%: credit equal to 10% of the monthly Fees for the affected Services;  
- Service availability below 98.0%: credit equal to 20% of the monthly Fees for the affected Services.

Service credits shall be applied against the next invoice(s) for the affected Services. Service credits are Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy for Vanguard’s failure to meet the Service Availability Commitment, subject to Contoso’s right to terminate for persistent or material SLA failures as provided below.

12.5 **Chronic SLA Failures.**  
If Vanguard fails to meet the Service Availability Commitment or the Severity 1 incident response time in three (3) consecutive months or in any four (4) months in a rolling twelve (12)-month period, Contoso may, in addition to other remedies, terminate the affected SOW for cause upon written notice, without penalty.

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT  

13.1 **Change Requests.**

13.2 **Change Order Process.**  
Upon receipt of a Change Request, Vanguard shall evaluate the impact on the project scope, timeline, resources, and Fees, and shall provide Contoso with a written proposal describing such impact (a “**Change Order**”). No Change Request shall be effective unless and until the Parties agree in writing to the corresponding Change Order, signed by duly authorized representatives. Once executed, the Change Order shall amend and become part of the applicable SOW and this Agreement.

13.3 **Effect on Timelines and Fees.**  
The Parties acknowledge that changes in scope may require adjustments to the project timeline and Fees. Vanguard shall not be obligated to perform any additional work beyond the original scope until the Parties have agreed to a Change Order. Contoso shall not be required to pay additional Fees unless the Parties have agreed to the applicable Change Order.

13.4 **Emergency Changes.**  
In emergency situations where immediate action is required to protect system integrity or prevent material harm to Contoso’s business, Vanguard may implement temporary changes without prior written Change Order, provided that Vanguard uses good faith efforts to obtain Contoso’s verbal approval and documents such changes in writing as soon as reasonably practicable. The Parties shall promptly negotiate any associated Change Order.

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION  

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  
If a dispute arises out of or relating to this Agreement, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute through informal negotiations between their respective project managers.

If the dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days after the appointment of a mediator, either Party may pursue its remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction as provided in Section 16.10. The Parties agree that any such litigation shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in King County, Washington.

14.4 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief or other equitable remedies from any court of competent jurisdiction at any time if necessary to prevent irreparable harm, without first engaging in the dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Article XIV.
