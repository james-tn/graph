## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  

To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, and consistent with the client-friendly risk posture (low risk), neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, revenue, or data, arising out of or relating to this Work Order, even if advised of the possibility of such damages, consistent with **Section 9.1** of the Parent Agreement.

9.2.2 For avoidance of doubt, this Work Order-specific cap is more favorable to Contoso (as Client) than the general cap in the Parent Agreement and is agreed as a client-friendly modification applicable only to this Work Order, as permitted by the last sentence of **Section 2.7** of the Parent Agreement (allowing an SOW to expressly supersede specific provisions of the Parent Agreement).

9.3 **Excluded Claims.**  

The limitations in **Section 9.1** and **Section 9.2** above shall not apply to:  

(a) A Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII** of this Work Order and the Parent Agreement;  
(b) A Party’s breach of the confidentiality obligations in **Article V** of this Work Order or **Article V** of the Parent Agreement;  
(c) A Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct;  
(d) Contoso’s obligation to pay Fees and reimbursable expenses owed under this Work Order.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.**  

The Parties acknowledge that the limitations of liability in this **Article IX**, read together with **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement, reflect a reasonable and negotiated allocation of risk given the Work Order Contract Value and the nature of the Services.
