## **ARTICLE XI  
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY**

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all Data Protection Laws applicable to its processing of Personal Data in connection with this Amendment. Without limiting the foregoing, Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access.

11.2 **Role of the Parties.** As between the Parties:

  (a) Client is the “controller” (or equivalent term under applicable law) of Personal Data contained in Client Data; and  
  (b) Vendor is a “processor” (or equivalent term) processing such Personal Data on behalf of Client, except to the extent Vendor processes Personal Data for its own legitimate business purposes (e.g., to manage Client accounts, billing, or compliance), in which case Vendor may be a separate controller.

11.3 **Processing Instructions.** Vendor shall process Client’s Personal Data only on documented instructions from Client, including with respect to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or international organization, unless Vendor is required to process Personal Data by Applicable Law, in which case Vendor shall inform Client of that legal requirement before processing, unless Applicable Law prohibits such disclosure.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Client hereby authorizes Vendor to engage subcontractors and subprocessors to process Personal Data in connection with the Services, provided Vendor remains responsible for the performance of such subprocessors and ensures that they are bound by written agreements that impose data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Amendment.

  (b) provide Client with information reasonably available to Vendor regarding the nature of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned, the categories and approximate number of Personal Data records concerned, and the likely consequences; and  
  (c) cooperate with Client in taking reasonable steps to investigate, contain, and remediate the Data Breach, and to comply with any legal or regulatory obligations (including breach notifications).

13.5 **Emergency Changes.** In the event of an emergency (including security incidents or critical defects) requiring immediate changes to the Services or Platform, Vendor may implement such changes without prior execution of a Change Order, provided Vendor reasonably believes that delay in implementing the changes would pose a material risk to the security, integrity, or availability of the Platform or Client Data.
