8.3.2 Allowing the indemnifying Party sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, provided that the indemnified Party may participate at its own expense and that the indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim that imposes any admission of liability or obligation on the indemnified Party without the indemnified Party’s prior written consent; and

8.3.3 Providing the indemnifying Party with reasonable assistance, at the indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defense and settlement of the claim.

8.4 **IP Infringement Mitigation.**  
If the Services or Deliverables are held, or Vendor reasonably believes they may be held, to infringe any third party IP Rights, Vendor may, at its option and expense:

8.4.1 Modify the Services or Deliverables so that they become non-infringing while substantially preserving their functionality;  
8.4.2 Obtain for Client a license to continue using the Services or Deliverables; or  
8.4.3 If neither (8.4.1) nor (8.4.2) is commercially reasonable, terminate the relevant Services or Deliverables and refund to Client the Fees paid for such Services or Deliverables, less a reasonable allocation for use prior to termination.

8.5 **Exclusions.**  
Vendor shall have no obligation to indemnify Client for any claim of IP infringement to the extent that such claim arises from: (a) Client’s unauthorized modification of the Deliverables; (b) combination of the Deliverables with other products, services, or materials not supplied or approved in writing by Vendor; or (c) Client’s use of the Deliverables in breach of this Work Order or beyond the scope of the licenses granted.

## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Cap on Liability.**  
Subject to Sections 9.3 and 9.4, each Party’s aggregate liability to the other Party arising out of or in connection with this Work Order (whether in contract, tort, negligence, breach of statutory duty, or otherwise) shall be limited to an amount equal to **two (2) times** the total Fees paid or payable by Client to Vendor under this Work Order in the **twelve (12) months** immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

9.2 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  
Subject to Sections 9.3 and 9.4, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any:

9.2.1 Loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of business, or loss of anticipated savings;  
9.2.2 Loss of or corruption of data (except to the extent recovery costs are covered as direct damages under the Services);  
9.2.3 Loss of goodwill or reputation; or  
9.2.4 Indirect, consequential, or punitive damages,  
in each case, whether or not such damages were foreseeable or the Party was advised of the possibility of such damages.

9.3 **Exceptions to Exclusions and Cap.**  
The limitations and exclusions in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 shall not apply to:

9.3.1 A Party’s fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;  
9.3.2 A Party’s liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence;  
9.3.3 Vendor’s indemnification obligations under Section 8.1.1 (IP infringement) and Client’s indemnification obligations under Section 8.2.1 (IP infringement); or  
9.3.4 A Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under Article V (but excluding any indirect, consequential, or punitive damages).

9.4 **Data Protection Liability.**  
For liabilities arising out of a breach of Data Protection Laws or this Work Order’s data protection provisions, the limitation of liability in Section 9.1 shall apply, provided that such cap shall not be less than an amount equal to the Contract Value. The Parties acknowledge that this is reasonable in light of the low risk classification and the nature of the Services.

9.5 **Client-Friendly Interpretation.**  
Given the low risk classification of this engagement, the Parties intend these limitations to fairly allocate risk in a manner that is favorable to the Client while ensuring that Vendor’s liability is reasonably predictable.
