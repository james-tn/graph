3.2.2 The Addendum Contract Value constitutes a good-faith estimate of Base Rent and projected Additional Rent attributable to the Additional Premises and related Addendum Services, subject to adjustment based on actual operating expenses, taxes, and other variables, consistent with **Section 3.3** of the Parent Agreement.

3.3.2 The Addendum Base Rent shall be as set forth in **Exhibit B-1 (Addendum Rent Schedule)**, which shall specify, for each Lease Year or portion thereof during the Addendum Term:  

(a) the annual Addendum Base Rent for the Additional Premises (expressed in US$ per rentable square foot per year);  
(b) the corresponding annual aggregate Addendum Base Rent; and  
(c) the equal monthly installments payable by Contoso.

3.3.3 The Parties agree that the Addendum Base Rent reflects (i) the rental rate applicable to similar space in the building, (ii) the High Risk Classification and extended term of this Addendum, and (iii) the incremental services and capacity required for the Additional Premises.

3.4.1 In addition to Addendum Base Rent, Contoso shall pay its proportionate share of **operating expenses, Real Property Taxes, insurance, CAM charges, and utilities** allocable to the Additional Premises (i.e., Addendum Additional Rent), as determined in accordance with the methodology set forth in **Section 3.3 (Additional Rent)** of the Parent Agreement.

(c) Additional Rent allocateable to the original Premises under the Parent Agreement; and  
(d) Addendum Additional Rent for the Additional Premises.

3.6.3 **Late Payment; Interest.** The provisions of **Section 3.6** of the Parent Agreement (Late Payment; Interest) shall apply to all late or unpaid amounts owed under this Addendum. For avoidance of doubt, interest shall accrue on any delinquent amount from the due date until paid, and Epsilon may impose late fees as specified in the Parent Agreement.

3.6.4 **Disputes.** Any disputes regarding invoices issued under this Addendum shall be handled in accordance with **Section 3.7 (Disputed Amounts)** of the Parent Agreement; provided, however, that any written notice of dispute shall explicitly reference this Addendum and the specific invoice(s) at issue.

## ARTICLE IV – TERM AND TERMINATION

4.1 **Addendum Term; Alignment with Parent Agreement.**  

4.1.1 The Term of this Addendum (the “Addendum Term”) shall commence on the **Addendum Commencement Date** as determined under **Section 2.4** and shall continue until the **Addendum Expiration Date**, which is **November 08, 2027**, unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Article IV and **Article IV** of the Parent Agreement.

4.1.2 The Parties acknowledge that the Parent Agreement currently provides for an **Expiration Date of December 02, 2027** (see **Section 1.1.6** and **Article IV**). For the Additional Premises, the Parties agree to an earlier expiration of November 08, 2027, such that, as of that date, the Additional Premises shall cease to be part of the Premises, unless the Parties mutually agree in writing to renew or extend the Addendum Term.

4.1.3 Nothing herein shall be construed to shorten the Term of the Parent Agreement with respect to the original Premises, except to the extent the Parent Agreement is terminated in its entirety in accordance with **Article IV** thereof.

4.2 **Renewal Options.**  

4.2.1 The renewal option granted to Contoso in **Section 4.2 (Renewal Options)** of the Parent Agreement shall **not automatically apply** to the Additional Premises. Any renewal or continuation of the lease of the Additional Premises beyond the Addendum Expiration Date shall require a separate written agreement or a further addendum executed by both Parties.

4.3 **Termination for Convenience – Addendum.**  

4.3.1 **By Contoso.** Notwithstanding **Section 4.3.1** of the Parent Agreement, which permits Contoso to terminate the entire Lease for convenience after the first twelve (12) months with sixty (60) days’ notice, the Parties agree that, due to the **High Risk Classification** and significant build-out obligations, Contoso may not terminate this Addendum for convenience sooner than **twenty-four (24) months** following the Addendum Commencement Date and, thereafter, only upon not less than **one hundred eighty (180) days’** prior written notice to Epsilon.  

4.3.1.1 Such termination may be limited to the Additional Premises, leaving the Parent Agreement in effect for the original Premises, unless Contoso expressly elects to terminate the entire Lease in accordance with the Parent Agreement.  

4.3.1.2 As a condition to any convenience termination of the Additional Premises, Contoso shall pay (a) all Fees due through the effective date of termination, and (b) an early termination fee equal to **four (4) months’ then-current aggregate Base Rent** (including Base Rent and Addendum Base Rent for the Amended Premises), which the Parties acknowledge represents a reasonable pre-estimate of Epsilon’s damages arising from such early termination given the high-risk classification.

4.3.2 **By Epsilon.** Epsilon may terminate this Addendum for convenience upon not less than **ninety (90) days’** prior written notice to Contoso, provided that such termination may be limited to the Additional Premises or may, at Epsilon’s option and subject to the Parent Agreement, extend to the entire Lease. Epsilon shall refund any prepaid Rent covering periods after termination, subject to setoff for amounts due.

4.4 **Termination for Cause.**  

The termination for cause provisions in **Section 4.4 (Termination for Cause)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to this Addendum. Any material breach of this Addendum shall be deemed a material breach of the Parent Agreement, and vice versa, for purposes of Article IV remedies, including termination rights.

4.5 **Effect of Termination of Parent Agreement.**  

4.5.1 In the event the Parent Agreement is terminated for any reason (including for cause, convenience, condemnation, or extended Force Majeure under **Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, or 15.3** of the Parent Agreement), this Addendum shall **automatically terminate** as of the effective date of such termination without the requirement of any additional notice.

4.5.2 Upon any termination of the Parent Agreement and/or this Addendum, Contoso shall surrender the Additional Premises in accordance with **Section 4.6 (Surrender of Premises)** of the Parent Agreement, including removal of trade fixtures, repair of damage, and return of access cards.

4.6 **Survival.**  

The survival provisions of **Section 4.7 (Effect of Termination)** and **Section 16.12 (Survival)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to this Addendum. Without limitation, Contoso’s payment obligations accrued prior to termination and the Parties’ obligations regarding Confidential Information, IP, indemnification, limitation of liability, and dispute resolution shall survive termination of this Addendum.

The confidentiality obligations set forth in **Article V (Confidentiality)** of the Parent Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference and shall apply equally to all Confidential Information exchanged in connection with this Addendum.

## ARTICLE VI – INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

6.1 **Ownership of Real Property and Improvements.**  

Epsilon’s ownership rights in the building, land, Premises, and Improvements set forth in **Section 6.1** of the Parent Agreement extend to the Additional Premises and all Improvements therein (excluding Contoso’s trade fixtures and personal property), subject to Contoso’s rights of occupancy during the Addendum Term.

6.2 **Pre-Existing IP and Vendor Systems.**  

The provisions of **Sections 6.2 – 6.4** of the Parent Agreement (Pre-Existing IP; License to Use Vendor Systems; Restrictions) shall apply to any Vendor Systems, access control systems, building management systems, and related materials used or made available in connection with the Additional Premises and Addendum Services.

6.3 **Deliverables for Additional Premises.**  

To the extent Epsilon creates any **Deliverables** (as defined in **Section 1.1.5** of the Parent Agreement) specifically and solely for Contoso in respect of the Additional Premises (e.g., specialized floor plans, security protocols, access control data), the licensing provisions in **Section 6.5 (Ownership of Deliverables)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply. In view of the High Risk Classification, Contoso’s rights to use such Deliverables are strictly limited to internal business purposes in connection with its occupancy of the Amended Premises and shall terminate upon Contoso’s final surrender of the Amended Premises, except to the extent a perpetual license is expressly granted by Epsilon in writing.

6.4 **Restrictions.**  

Without limiting **Section 6.4** of the Parent Agreement, Contoso shall not, and shall not permit any third party to, use any plans, specifications, or building systems configurations provided by Epsilon for any property other than the building referenced in the Parent Agreement and this Addendum, nor shall Contoso reproduce or distribute such materials except as reasonably necessary for its internal architectural, safety, and operational purposes.

## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Modification of Parent Liability Cap – High Risk, Uncapped Liability.**  

9.1.1 Notwithstanding **Section 9.1 (Limitation on Direct Damages)** of the Parent Agreement, which caps each Party’s aggregate liability, the Parties agree that, due to the **High Risk Classification** of this Addendum and the increased scope and value of the Additional Premises operations:

(a) **No monetary cap** shall apply to Epsilon’s or Contoso’s aggregate liability arising under or in connection with this Addendum or the Parent Agreement as it relates to the Additional Premises and Amended Premises; and  
(b) **Section 9.1** of the Parent Agreement is hereby amended to the extent inconsistent with this Section 9.1.1, solely for claims arising under or relating to this Addendum and the Additional Premises.

9.2 **Consequential and Similar Damages Included.**  

9.2.1 Notwithstanding **Section 9.2 (Exclusion of Certain Damages)** of the Parent Agreement, the Parties agree that **neither Party shall be entitled to rely on any exclusion of consequential, incidental, special, punitive, exemplary, or indirect damages** with respect to claims arising out of or in connection with this Addendum or the Additional Premises.  

9.2.2 Accordingly, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, both Parties may recover, subject to proof, consequential and other indirect damages resulting from the other Party’s breach of this Addendum, including, without limitation, loss of business or profits, loss of use, and similar damages.

9.3 **Exceptions.**  

The exceptions set forth in **Section 9.3** of the Parent Agreement (for indemnification obligations, confidentiality violations, data protection breaches, gross negligence, fraud, willful misconduct, and payment obligations) remain in full force and effect and are cumulative to the modifications in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 above.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.**  

The Parties acknowledge that the removal of liability caps and the inclusion of consequential damages, combined with the broad indemnification obligations in **Article VIII**, are integral to the commercial bargain reflected in the Addendum Contract Value and High Risk Classification, and that the Addendum Base Rent and other economic terms incorporate consideration for this expanded risk allocation.
