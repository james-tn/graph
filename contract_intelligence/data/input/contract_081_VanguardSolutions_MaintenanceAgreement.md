## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its performance and use of the Services under this Agreement. To the extent that the Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of the Client, the Vendor shall act as a “service provider” or “processor,” and the Client shall act as a “business” or “controller,” as such terms are defined under applicable law.

The Vendor shall process Personal Data only:

  a. In accordance with the Client’s documented instructions, as set forth in this Agreement and any SOW;

  c. In compliance with appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

11.3 **Subprocessors.**  
The Vendor may engage subprocessors to process Personal Data on its behalf, provided that:

Upon request, Vendor shall provide Client with a list of subprocessors involved in processing Personal Data.

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Service Availability.**  
Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the covered systems and Services achieve a minimum **monthly uptime of 99.9%**, excluding Scheduled Downtime as defined below. Uptime shall be calculated as:

> (Total Minutes in Month – Unscheduled Downtime – Excluded Downtime) / (Total Minutes in Month – Excluded Downtime)

12.2 **Scheduled Downtime.**  
“**Scheduled Downtime**” means planned downtime for maintenance, upgrades, or other changes, as coordinated with the Client. Vendor shall provide at least five (5) Business Days’ notice for non-emergency Scheduled Downtime and shall schedule such downtime during agreed Maintenance Windows to minimize business impact.

12.3 **Incident Severity Levels.**  

  a. **Severity 1 (Critical)** – Complete outage or major incident causing significant impact to the Client’s core operations; no workaround available.  

  b. **Severity 2 (High)** – Significant degradation of service or functionality with limited workaround.  

  c. **Severity 3 (Medium)** – Partial loss of functionality or performance issues with reasonable workaround.  

  d. **Severity 4 (Low)** – Minor issues, cosmetic defects, or general inquiries.

12.4 **Response Times.**  

Vendor shall meet the following initial Response Times (as defined in Section 1.17):

  - Severity 1: within **1 hour**, 24x7  
  - Severity 2: within **4 hours** during Service Hours

  - Severity 4: within **2 Business Days**

12.5 **Resolution Times (Targets).**  

Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the following Resolution Time targets:

  - Severity 1: workaround or restoration of service within **4 hours** of acknowledgment;  
  - Severity 2: resolution within **1 Business Day** of acknowledgment;  
  - Severity 3: resolution within **5 Business Days** of acknowledgment;  
  - Severity 4: resolution in next scheduled maintenance cycle or as mutually agreed.

Resolution Timeframes are targets and not strict guarantees; however, repeated failures may constitute a material service deficiency.

12.6 **Escalation.**  
Vendor shall maintain an escalation process for unresolved Incidents, which shall include:

  a. Escalation to senior technical staff if Severity 1 or 2 Incidents are not resolved within target Resolution Times;  

  b. Designated management-level contacts available to the Client for escalation of critical issues; and  

  c. Regular status updates for Severity 1 and 2 Incidents until resolved.

12.7 **Service Credits.**  
If Vendor fails to meet the 99.9% monthly uptime commitment (excluding Scheduled Downtime and Force Majeure Events), the Client may be entitled to service credits as follows:

  - Uptime between 99.5% and 99.9%: credit equal to 5% of the monthly recurring fees for the affected Service;  
  - Uptime between 99.0% and 99.5%: credit equal to 10% of the monthly recurring fees for the affected Service;  
  - Uptime below 99.0%: credit equal to 20% of the monthly recurring fees for the affected Service.

Service credits shall be the Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the uptime SLA, except where such failure results from Vendor’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

12.8 **Exclusions from SLA.**  
The SLA does not apply to downtime or service degradation caused by:

  a. Client’s acts or omissions, including misuse or unauthorized modifications;  

  b. Failure of Client’s third-party systems, software, or network connectivity;  

  c. Scheduled Downtime;

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a “**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiations between designated senior executives of each Party. Either Party may initiate this process by providing written notice to the other Party describing the nature of the Dispute.

14.2 **Mediation.**  
If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through negotiation within thirty (30) days after such notice, either Party may request that the Dispute be submitted to non-binding mediation in **San Francisco, California**, conducted by a mutually agreed mediator or, if none is agreed, by a mediator appointed by JAMS. The costs of mediation shall be shared equally by the Parties, except that each Party shall bear its own legal fees.

14.3 **Arbitration / Litigation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days after commencement of mediation, the Dispute shall be finally resolved as follows:

  a. The Parties agree that either Party may elect to submit the Dispute to **binding arbitration** administered by JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, with a single arbitrator, in San Francisco, California; OR  

  b. If neither Party elects arbitration within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of mediation, either Party may bring an action in the state or federal courts located in **San Francisco County, California**, and the Parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction thereof.

14.4 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information, Intellectual Property, or data protection interests, without first engaging in negotiation or mediation.
