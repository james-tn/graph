## ARTICLE II  
SCOPE OF SERVICES, PRODUCTS, AND WORK

2.1 **General Relationship to Parent Agreement.**  

2.1.1 This Amendment is expressly **subject to and incorporates by reference** all terms and conditions of the Parent Agreement **PUR-GAM-202403-298 (contract_298)**, except as expressly modified herein. The general **scope of Products and Services** described in **Article II (Scope of Products, Services, and Work)** of the Parent Agreement remains applicable and in full force and effect.

2.1.2 For clarity, the integrated hardware and software platform for Contoso’s data center modernization initiative referenced in **Section 2.1 (General Scope)** of the Parent Agreement remains the overall project objective. This Amendment refines specific **quantities, configurations, and pricing of certain Products and Services** to reflect updated project requirements.

2.2 **Amended Products and Quantities.**

2.2.1 **Core Hardware Systems.** Gamma shall continue to supply enterprise-grade server, storage, and networking hardware under **Section 2.2.1 (Core Hardware Systems)** of the Parent Agreement. However, the Parties hereby amend the quantities and configurations of certain items as set forth in **Exhibit A-1 (Revised Product and Pricing Schedule)**, which replaces and supersedes any inconsistent product quantity or pricing tables previously agreed under the Parent Agreement, any SOW, or any applicable Purchase Order.

2.2.2 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following are examples of adjustments reflected in Exhibit A-1:

  - A reduction in the number of certain **rack-mounted servers** where Contoso’s updated load projections indicate lower compute requirements;  
  - An increase in certain **storage arrays** and associated high-performance drives to address greater-than-expected data retention and I/O throughput needs; and  
  - A rebalancing of **networking hardware** (including core and top-of-rack switches) to align with Contoso’s revised network segmentation strategy.

2.2.3 All Amended Products shall continue to conform in all material respects to the **Specifications** agreed by the Parties in the Parent Agreement and any applicable SOW, consistent with **Section 2.2.1 (Core Hardware Systems)** and **Section 2.6.2 (Compliance with Specifications)** of the Parent Agreement.

2.3 **Amended Services and Deliverables.**

2.3.1 Gamma shall continue to perform **Implementation and Configuration Services** under **Section 2.3.1** of the Parent Agreement, **Migration and Cutover Services** under **Section 2.3.2**, **Training and Knowledge Transfer** under **Section 2.3.3**, and **Support and Maintenance Services** under **Section 2.3.4**, as applicable.  

2.3.2 This Amendment modifies the **quantities and pricing** (but not the fundamental nature) of certain Services, including:

  - Additional implementation hours needed for deploying increased storage capacity;  
  - Reduced implementation effort associated with reduced server counts;  
  - Adjusted migration and cutover effort to match Contoso’s updated phasing plan; and  
  - Updated annual support and maintenance charges reflecting the revised hardware and software footprint.

These adjustments are set forth in **Exhibit A-2 (Revised Services and Support Schedule)**.

2.3.3 **Deliverables.** The types of Deliverables described in **Section 2.4 (Deliverables)** of the Parent Agreement remain applicable; however, the volume, scope, or associated pricing of certain Deliverables (such as configuration documentation and test reports) may be proportionally adjusted to reflect the updated architecture. Any such adjustments are detailed in **Exhibit A-2** and shall continue to meet the performance and quality standards set forth in **Section 2.6 (Performance Standards)** of the Parent Agreement.

2.4 **Timelines, Milestones, and Project Plan.**

2.4.1 Pursuant to **Section 2.5 (Timelines and Milestones)** of the Parent Agreement, Gamma shall revise the project plan to reflect any schedule impacts caused by the changes to Products and Services under this Amendment. The updated project plan shall:

  - Identify any new or modified milestones associated with the deployment of Amended Products and Amended Services;  
  - Reconfirm any milestones previously designated as **“Critical” or “Time-Sensitive”** under **Section 2.5.3** of the Parent Agreement; and  
  - Provide updated target dates and dependencies, subject to Contoso’s review and approval.

2.4.2 The Parties acknowledge that **time remains of the essence** for milestones previously designated as critical. Repeated or material delays associated with Amended Products and Services, not excused under **Article XV (Force Majeure)** of the Parent Agreement, may still constitute a **material breach** under **Section 4.3 (Termination for Cause)** of the Parent Agreement.

2.5 **Performance Standards and Acceptance.**

2.5.1 Gamma’s obligations to perform Services in a **professional and workmanlike manner** and to ensure the Products and Deliverables conform to the Specifications under **Section 2.6 (Performance Standards)** of the Parent Agreement remain unchanged.

2.5.2 Acceptance criteria, test plans, and testing Deliverables relating to Amended Products and Amended Services shall be updated as necessary but shall follow the same framework set forth in **Section 2.4.3 (Acceptance Criteria and Testing Deliverables)** of the Parent Agreement.

2.5.3 Any nonconformance of Amended Products or related Deliverables shall be addressed in accordance with **Section 2.6.2 (Compliance with Specifications)**, including Gamma’s obligation to re-perform the Services or repair or replace nonconforming Products at its own cost.

2.6 **Relationship to Change Management.**

2.6.1 The Parties acknowledge that this Amendment is a **formal, negotiated amendment** to the Parent Agreement and its associated SOWs and is not merely a **Change Order** under **Article XIII (Change Management)**. However, any **future modifications** to quantities or pricing of Products or Services shall be governed by the Change Management process defined in **Sections 13.1 – 13.4** of the Parent Agreement.
