## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Service Availability.**  
The Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the covered systems, as defined in the applicable SOW, achieve an average monthly uptime of **99.9%**, excluding:

  a. scheduled maintenance windows agreed in advance with the Client;  

  b. downtime attributable to the Client, third-party providers under the Client’s control, or Force Majeure Events; or  

  c. downtime caused by Out-of-Scope Work requested by the Client.

12.2 **Incident Severity Levels.**  
The Parties agree to the following severity levels:

  a. **Severity 1 (Critical):** Complete outage or major failure affecting a business-critical system with no workaround available.  

  b. **Severity 2 (High):** Significant degradation impacting important business functions, but system remains partially operational or a workaround is available.  

  c. **Severity 3 (Medium):** Moderate impact on non-critical functions, with a workaround available and business operations not substantially affected.  

  d. **Severity 4 (Low):** Minor issues, cosmetic defects, or service requests with minimal impact on operations.

12.3 **Response and Resolution Targets.**  
The Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the following targets:

     - Response Time: within **1 hour** (24x7)  
     - Resolution Time: target **8 hours**  

  b. **Severity 2:**  
     - Response Time: within **2 hours** (Business Days during standard support hours)

     - Response Time: within **1 Business Day**

12.4 **Service Credits.**  
If the Service Provider fails to meet the availability commitment in Section 12.1 for a given calendar month, the Client may be entitled to Service Credits as follows:

  a. Uptime < 99.9% but ≥ 99.5%: Service Credit equal to **2%** of the monthly base maintenance fee.

Service Credits shall be applied as a discount against the next invoice(s) issued to the Client. The Client must request Service Credits in writing within thirty (30) days of the end of the month in which the failure occurred. Service Credits are the sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the service availability targets in this Article XII.

12.5 **Exclusions from SLA.**  
SLA commitments shall not apply to:

  a. any outage or degradation caused by the Client’s negligence, misuse, or failure to comply with this Agreement;

  b. a formal Change Order is executed as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.

14.4 **Jurisdiction.**
