## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **No Aggregate Cap – Vendor-Favourable Provision.** Given the high-risk classification of this Addendum and the agreed risk allocation, **THERE SHALL BE NO CONTRACTUAL CAP OR LIMITATION ON THE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY** for any claims arising under or in connection with this Addendum, except as expressly set forth in this Article IX.

9.2 **Types of Damages.** SUBJECT TO SECTION 9.3, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, EXCEPT THAT:

9.2.1 **CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, AND INCIDENTAL DAMAGES ARE EXPRESSLY PERMITTED AND RECOVERABLE** under this Addendum due to the High Risk designation, and the Parties acknowledge that such damages may be foreseeable and within the contemplation of the Parties; and

9.2.2 EACH PARTY MAY CLAIM AND RECOVER CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT SUCH DAMAGES ARE RECOVERABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

9.3 **Exceptions.** The limitations in Section 9.2 shall not apply to:  
(a) a Party’s indemnification obligations under Article VIII;  
(b) breach of confidentiality obligations under Article V;  
(c) breach of data protection obligations under Article XI;  
(d) Client’s payment obligations under Article III; or  
(e) any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under Applicable Law.

9.4 **Mitigation of Loss.** Each Party shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate any loss or damage it may suffer in connection with any claim or cause of action arising under this Addendum.

9.5 **Allocation of Risk.** The Parties acknowledge that the fees and the allocation of risk reflect the assumption of potentially significant liability by both Parties, particularly given the inclusion of consequential damages and absence of an aggregate cap.

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.** For purposes of Applicable Data Protection Laws, the Parties acknowledge that Client is the **Controller** and Vendor is the **Processor** with respect to Personal Data processed by Vendor on Client’s behalf in connection with the Services.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.** Vendor shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Client, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or international organisation, unless required to do so by Applicable Law. In such case, Vendor shall inform Client of that legal requirement before processing, unless the law prohibits such disclosure.

11.3 **Security Measures.** Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as required by Applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Client hereby authorises Vendor to engage subprocessors to process Personal Data in connection with the Services. Vendor shall ensure that any such subprocessors are bound by written agreements imposing data protection obligations not less protective than those set forth in this Article XI. Vendor shall remain fully liable for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors.

11.5 **Data Subject Rights.** Vendor shall, taking into account the nature of the processing, assist Client by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as possible, for the fulfilment of Client’s obligations to respond to requests from Data Subjects to exercise their rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws. Vendor shall promptly notify Client if it receives a request directly from a Data Subject relating to Personal Data, and shall not respond to such request except on Client’s documented instructions or as required by Applicable Law.

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Addendum, Vendor shall, at Client’s option and subject to Applicable Law, delete or return all Personal Data to Client and delete any existing copies, except for Personal Data stored in backup systems that are not accessible in the ordinary course of business, which shall be deleted in accordance with Vendor’s normal data retention cycles.

11.7 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of an Incident involving Personal Data, Vendor shall:

11.7.1 Notify Client without undue delay and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours after becoming aware of such Incident;

11.7.2 Provide Client with all reasonably available information relating to the Incident, including the nature of the Incident, the categories and approximate number of Data Subjects and records concerned, the likely consequences, and any measures taken or proposed to address the Incident; and

11.7.3 Co-operate with Client and take such reasonable steps as Client may require to assist in the investigation, mitigation, and remediation of the Incident, including providing assistance in relation to any notifications to Data Subjects or Supervisory Authorities.

11.8 **International Transfers.** To the extent Vendor transfers Personal Data outside the UK or EEA to a country that has not been recognised as providing an adequate level of protection, Vendor shall ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses or binding corporate rules, as required by Applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.9 **CCPA Compliance (If Applicable).** To the extent CCPA applies to any Personal Data processed under this Addendum, Vendor shall act as a “service provider” (as defined under CCPA), shall not “sell” Personal Data, and shall not retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any purpose other than for the specific business purpose of performing the Services, as set forth in this Addendum and Client’s instructions.

11.10 **Audit Rights.** Upon Client’s reasonable prior written request (not more than once annually, unless required by a Supervisory Authority or following a material Incident), Vendor shall make available to Client information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Article XI and shall allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by Client or an independent auditor mandated by Client, at Client’s expense and subject to Vendor’s reasonable security and confidentiality requirements.

(e) Third-Party Materials or underlying cloud platform outages beyond Vendor’s reasonable control.
