Without limiting the foregoing, Vendor shall process Personal Data only as necessary to perform the Services in accordance with Client’s documented instructions and this Agreement.

11.2 **Data Processing Role.** To the extent Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of Client, Client shall be deemed the “controller” (or equivalent term under applicable law) and Vendor shall be deemed the “processor” (or equivalent term) as those terms are defined under GDPR and other Data Protection Laws.

11.3 **Security Measures.** Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, commensurate with the risk and the nature of the Personal Data processed, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the context and purposes of processing.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Vendor may engage subcontractors or subprocessors to perform portions of the Services that involve processing of Personal Data, provided that Vendor: (a) remains responsible for the acts and omissions of such subprocessors; (b) imposes on such subprocessors data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement; and (c) provides Client, upon written request, with information on the categories of subprocessors used for the Services, subject to confidentiality.

  (a) Uptime between 99.0% and 99.9%: service credit equal to 5% of the monthly recurring managed services fees;  
  (b) Uptime between 98.0% and 99.0%: service credit equal to 10% of such fees;  
  (c) Uptime less than 98.0%: service credit equal to 20% of such fees.
