Contoso shall be responsible for determining the categories and sources of Contoso Data, the purposes for which Contoso Data is Processed, and the means by which such Processing is conducted, consistent with the Service capabilities. Acme shall Process Contoso Data solely in accordance with Contoso’s documented instructions and the terms of this Agreement.

2.3 **Deliverables.**  
Acme shall produce and deliver to Contoso the Deliverables agreed in any applicable SOW, which may include, without limitation:

  (a) periodic performance and usage reports (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly) providing insights into system uptime, transaction volumes, and data quality metrics;

Unless otherwise specified in an SOW, Deliverables shall be deemed accepted upon delivery unless Contoso notifies Acme in writing within fifteen (15) Business Days of delivery of any material non-conformity with the applicable specifications. Acme shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cure any such non-conformity within a reasonable period.

2.4 **Timelines and Milestones.**  
The Parties shall mutually agree on project timelines and milestones in the applicable SOW(s). Milestones may include, by way of example:

  (b) completion of user acceptance testing (“UAT”) of the Platform with Contoso Data;  

  (c) go-live date for production access; and  

  (d) delivery dates for specific analytics reports or feature configurations.

Acme shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet all agreed-upon timelines and milestones. Contoso acknowledges that such timelines may be impacted by delays caused by Contoso, its Affiliates, or third-party providers, including delays in providing required data, access, approvals, or resources. In such event, the Parties shall adjust the relevant timelines and milestones accordingly and in good faith.

  (a) in a professional and workmanlike manner, in accordance with industry standards for similar services;  

  (b) with personnel having the requisite skills, experience, and qualifications;

Acme’s performance is conditioned upon Contoso’s timely cooperation and provision of accurate and complete information. Acme shall not be liable for failure to meet its obligations under this Agreement to the extent such failure is attributable to Contoso’s delay, omission, or inaccuracy.

Contoso shall not, and shall not permit any third party to:

  (a) use the Services in violation of any applicable law, including data protection, privacy, or export control laws;  

  (b) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Platform or any related systems or networks;

2.8 **Subprocessors and Third-Party Services.**  
Acme may engage Subprocessors to perform certain aspects of the Services, including hosting providers and support contractors, in accordance with Section 11.8. Acme shall remain responsible for the performance of such Subprocessors and their compliance with the data protection obligations set forth in this Agreement. Where the Services rely on third-party services (e.g., cloud infrastructure), Acme’s obligations are subject to the performance of such third-party providers; however, Acme shall use reasonable efforts to enforce or pass through relevant commitments for the benefit of Contoso.

Acme shall notify Contoso if, in Acme’s reasonable opinion, an instruction from Contoso infringes Applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.3 **Compliance with Applicable Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with Applicable Data Protection Laws in the performance of this Agreement. In particular:

  (a) Contoso shall ensure that it has a lawful basis for the Processing of Personal Data and has provided appropriate notices and obtained any required consents from Data Subjects; and
