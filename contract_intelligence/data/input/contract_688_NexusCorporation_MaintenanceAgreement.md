## ARTICLE XI  
# DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws with respect to its own processing of Personal Data under this Agreement. To the extent that Nexus processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso, Nexus shall be deemed a “processor” (or equivalent term under Applicable Law), and Contoso a “controller.”

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.** Nexus shall:

  11.2.1 process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso and solely for the purpose of performing the Services, except where otherwise required by Applicable Law (in which case Nexus shall, to the extent legally permitted, inform Contoso of that legal requirement before processing);

  11.2.2 ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;

  11.2.3 implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data.

11.3 **Subprocessors.** Contoso authorizes Nexus to engage subprocessors to process Personal Data, provided that Nexus:

  11.3.1 imposes on such subprocessors data protection obligations that are materially no less protective than those imposed on Nexus under this Article XI; and

  11.3.2 remains liable to Contoso for the performance of such subprocessors’ obligations.

Upon request, Nexus shall provide Contoso with a list of its then-current subprocessors involved in data processing activities for the Services.

11.4 **Cross-Border Transfers.** If Nexus transfers Personal Data across national borders in connection with the Services, Nexus shall ensure that such transfers comply with applicable Data Protection Laws, including, where required, the use of appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent mechanisms.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a confirmed or reasonably suspected Personal Data breach or security incident involving Contoso’s Personal Data:

  11.5.1 Nexus shall notify Contoso without undue delay (and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the breach), providing available details including: the nature of the breach, categories and approximate number of data subjects and records concerned, likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to address the breach;

  11.5.2 Nexus shall cooperate with Contoso, at Nexus’s expense, in investigating the breach, mitigating its effects, and complying with any notification or remedial obligations under Data Protection Laws, including communications with regulators and affected individuals, as reasonably directed by Contoso.

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Subject to Applicable Law and Contoso’s written instructions:

  11.6.1 Nexus shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as otherwise instructed by Contoso;

  11.6.2 upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Contoso’s request, Nexus shall securely return or delete all Personal Data in its possession or control, except to the extent retention is required by Applicable Law. Nexus shall certify in writing to Contoso that such deletion has occurred, upon request.

11.7 **Audits.** Upon reasonable prior written notice and no more than once per calendar year (except following a data breach), Contoso or its designated auditors may conduct an audit of Nexus’s data protection practices relevant to this Agreement, including review of relevant security certifications and policies. Nexus shall cooperate with such audit, provided it does not unreasonably interfere with Nexus’s business operations and subject to appropriate confidentiality protections.

## ARTICLE XII  
# SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Uptime Commitment.** Nexus shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Systems under its maintenance responsibility achieve a minimum monthly uptime of **99.9%**, excluding Planned Downtime and outages caused by Force Majeure Events or Contoso’s actions or omissions. Uptime shall be measured on a calendar-month basis.

12.2 **Planned Downtime and Maintenance Windows.**

  12.2.1 Nexus shall schedule Planned Downtime within agreed Maintenance Windows to minimize disruption to Contoso’s operations.

  12.2.2 Nexus shall provide Contoso with at least five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice of Planned Downtime that is expected to exceed thirty (30) minutes.

12.3 **Incident Priority Levels.** Incidents shall be categorized as follows (unless otherwise defined in an SOW):

  12.3.1 **Priority 1 – Critical:** Complete outage or severe degradation of mission-critical systems with no workaround.

  12.3.2 **Priority 2 – High:** Significant impact on key functionality or large user groups; partial system failure with limited workaround.

  12.3.3 **Priority 3 – Medium:** Moderate impact on non-critical functions; workaround available.

  12.3.4 **Priority 4 – Low:** Minor issues, cosmetic defects, or informational requests.

12.4 **Response and Resolution Targets.** Nexus shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the following response and resolution time targets, measured from the time Contoso logs an Incident through the agreed ticketing channel:

| Priority | Initial Response Target | Resolution / Workaround Target |
|---------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| P1      | 30 minutes (24x7)       | 4 hours                        |
| P2      | 1 hour (Business Days)  | 8 hours                        |
| P3      | 4 hours (Business Days) | 3 Business Days                |
| P4      | 1 Business Day          | 10 Business Days               |

These targets are goals and not absolute guarantees; failure to achieve them shall be addressed through the remedies set forth in **Section 12.5**.

12.5 **SLA Remedies.** If Nexus fails to meet the monthly uptime commitment of 99.9% for a given System:

  12.5.1 Contoso shall be entitled to service credits equal to a percentage of the monthly maintenance fee attributable to the affected System, as follows:

  - Uptime between 99.0% and 99.9%: **5%** credit  
  - Uptime between 98.0% and 99.0%: **10%** credit  
  - Uptime below 98.0%: **20%** credit

  12.5.2 Service credits shall be applied against the next invoice or, if there is no subsequent invoice, refunded to Contoso within forty-five (45) days.

  12.5.3 Service credits shall be Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for failure to meet the uptime Service Levels, except where such failure arises from Nexus’s gross negligence, willful misconduct, or repeated material Service Level breaches, in which case Contoso may additionally exercise its rights under **Article IV** (Termination) and **Article IX** (Limitation of Liability).

12.6 **Reporting and Review.** Nexus shall provide Contoso with monthly Service Level reports summarizing uptime, Incident statistics, response and resolution times, and applied credits (if any). The Parties shall conduct periodic service reviews (at least quarterly) to discuss performance, improvements, and any recurring issues.

## ARTICLE XIV  
# DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good-Faith Negotiation.** In the event of any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination (a **“Dispute”**), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through negotiations between senior representatives.

14.4 **Arbitration.** If the Parties do not resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after initial notice (or such longer period as they may mutually agree in writing), the Dispute shall be finally resolved by arbitration administered by the **Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC)** in accordance with the **SIAC Rules** for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The seat of arbitration shall be Singapore. The tribunal shall consist of one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with the SIAC Rules. The language of arbitration shall be English.

14.5 **Interim Relief.** Nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking interim or conservatory measures, including injunctive relief, from any court of competent jurisdiction at any time, without waiving its right to arbitration.
