  8.3.3 provide reasonable cooperation and assistance at the indemnifying Party’s expense.

8.4 **Mitigation.**  
In the event of an IP infringement claim, Summit Tech may, at its option and expense: (a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using the Deliverables; (b) modify the Deliverables so that they become non-infringing while substantially preserving their functionality; or (c) replace the Deliverables with non-infringing items of substantially equivalent functionality. If none of the foregoing options are commercially reasonable, Summit Tech may terminate the affected Services or Deliverables and refund the Fees paid for such Services or Deliverables, less a reasonable allocation for use prior to termination.

8.5 **Exclusive Remedy.**  
The indemnities set forth in this **Article VIII** state the indemnifying Party’s sole and exclusive liability, and the indemnified Party’s sole and exclusive remedy, for any third-party claims covered by such indemnities.

## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Uncapped Liability.**  
In light of the high-risk nature of the Programme, the Parties expressly agree that **there shall be no contractual cap on the liability of either Party** under this Agreement. Accordingly, each Party’s liability for losses arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be unlimited, subject only to mandatory restrictions under applicable law.

9.2 **Types of Recoverable Damages.**  
Notwithstanding any rule of law or equity to the contrary and given the critical nature of the Services, the Parties agree that:

  9.2.1 both direct and indirect losses are recoverable; and  
  9.2.2 consequential, incidental, special, punitive, exemplary, and loss of profits or revenue damages shall **not** be excluded and may be recovered to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

9.3 **Scope.**  
The foregoing allocation of risk shall apply to all causes of action, regardless of whether arising in contract, tort (including negligence), misrepresentation, breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, and regardless of the theory of liability.

9.4 **Mitigation.**  
Each Party shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate any loss or damage it suffers in connection with this Agreement.

9.5 **Insurance Interface.**  
Each Party acknowledges that the allocation of risk in this Article is reflected in the insurance obligations in **Article X**. The existence of insurance shall not limit or otherwise affect either Party’s liability under this Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all Data Protection Laws applicable to its activities under this Agreement. To the extent Summit Tech processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso, Summit Tech shall act as a "processor" and Contoso as a "controller" (as such terms are defined in Data Protection Laws).

11.2 **Processing Instructions.**  
Summit Tech shall process Personal Data only on Contoso’s documented instructions as set forth in this Agreement and any data processing schedule agreed by the Parties, unless required to do otherwise by applicable law. In such event, Summit Tech shall inform Contoso of that legal requirement before processing, unless prohibited by law.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
Summit Tech shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction, or damage, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing.

11.4 **Sub-processors.**  
Contoso authorizes Summit Tech to engage sub-processors for the processing of Personal Data, provided that Summit Tech ensures that any such sub-processor is bound by written terms that are no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement. Summit Tech shall remain fully liable for the acts and omissions of its sub-processors.

11.5 **Data Subject Rights and Assistance.**  
Summit Tech shall, taking into account the nature of the processing, assist Contoso by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as possible, for the fulfilment of Contoso’s obligations to respond to requests by data subjects to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws.

11.6 **Data Breach Notification.**  
Summit Tech shall notify Contoso without undue delay and, where feasible, within forty-eight (48) hours after becoming aware of a Personal Data breach affecting Client Data. Such notice shall include, to the extent available, details of the nature of the breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records concerned, likely consequences, and proposed remedial actions.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement or upon Contoso’s written request, Summit Tech shall, at Contoso’s option, delete or return all Personal Data processed on behalf of Contoso, and delete existing copies unless applicable law requires storage of such data. Data held in backups shall be securely protected and eventually overwritten in accordance with Summit Tech’s standard backup policies.

11.8 **International Transfers.**  
Where Summit Tech or its sub-processors transfer Personal Data outside the UK or EEA, such transfers shall be subject to appropriate safeguards as required by Data Protection Laws, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent mechanisms.

Subject to reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, Contoso or its designated auditors may, no more than once in any twelve (12) month period (unless required by a supervisory authority or following a data breach), conduct audits of Summit Tech’s compliance with this Article XI, provided such audits do not unreasonably disrupt Summit Tech’s operations and are subject to confidentiality obligations.

12.1 **Service Availability.**  
For the managed services provided under this Agreement, Summit Tech shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the covered production environments achieve a monthly uptime percentage of at least **99.9%**, excluding scheduled maintenance windows and permitted downtime as defined in this Article.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  
Summit Tech shall be entitled to schedule maintenance windows during which Services may be temporarily unavailable.

12.5 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.**  
If Summit Tech fails to meet the uptime commitment in **Section 12.1** in any calendar month, Summit Tech shall, upon Contoso’s written request made within thirty (30) days of the end of the month in question, provide service credits as follows (illustrative):

  12.5.1 Uptime 99.0%–99.89%: service credit equal to 5% of the monthly managed services Fees;

  12.5.3 Uptime below 98.0%: service credit equal to 15% of the monthly managed services Fees.

Service credits shall be applied as a deduction from subsequent invoices and shall constitute Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet uptime commitments, without prejudice to any other rights Contoso may have in respect of persistent or material SLA failures (e.g., termination for cause under **Section 4.5**).

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  
Either Party may request changes to the scope, Deliverables, timelines, or other aspects of the Services (each a **"Change Request"**). All Change Requests shall be made in writing and shall describe the proposed change, rationale, and anticipated impact on scope, Fees, and timelines.

13.2 **Change Orders.**  
Upon receipt of a Change Request, Summit Tech shall assess the technical and commercial impact and submit to Contoso a written **Change Order** specifying:

  13.2.1 the nature and details of the proposed change;  
  13.2.2 any adjustments to the scope of Services and Deliverables;  
  13.2.3 any adjustments to the project plan and timelines; and  
  13.2.4 any adjustments to the Fees, including any one-time or recurring charges.

13.3 **Approval Process.**  
No Change Order shall be effective unless and until it is agreed and signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Summit Tech shall have no obligation to commence work on any change until the relevant Change Order has been fully executed.

13.4 **Effect on Services and Fees.**  
Once executed, a Change Order shall form part of this Agreement and the Services and Fees shall be adjusted accordingly. Any delay caused by Contoso’s failure to promptly review or approve a Change Order may entitle Summit Tech to adjust the timelines and Fees reasonably.

13.5 **Emergency Changes.**  
In the event of an emergency that requires immediate action to protect the stability or security of the systems, Summit Tech may implement necessary changes without prior written Change Order, provided that Summit Tech shall notify Contoso as soon as reasonably practicable and, where required, follow up with a retroactive Change Order.

14.3 **Mediation.**  
If the dispute is not resolved through escalation, the Parties shall attempt to settle it by mediation in London, England, in accordance with the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) Model Mediation Procedure then in force. Unless otherwise agreed, the mediator shall be appointed by CEDR, and the costs of the mediation shall be shared equally by the Parties.

14.4 **Arbitration / Litigation.**

  14.4.1 Final and binding arbitration under the Rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA), by a panel of three arbitrators, with the seat of arbitration in London, England; and

14.6 **Continued Performance.**  
Pending final resolution of any dispute, the Parties shall continue to perform their obligations under this Agreement to the extent reasonably practicable.
