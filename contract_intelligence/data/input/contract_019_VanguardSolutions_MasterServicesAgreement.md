  (d) A Deliverable shall be deemed accepted upon the earliest of: (i) Client’s written acceptance; (ii) Client’s use of the Deliverable in a production environment or for live business operations (other than limited testing); or (iii) the expiration of the Acceptance Period without Client providing a written notice of non-conformity.

Acceptance shall not limit Client’s rights with respect to any latent defects, warranties, or Service Levels.

8.4 **IP Infringement Mitigation.** In addition to its indemnification obligations in Section 8.1(a), if the Services, Deliverables, or Work Product are, or in Vendor’s reasonable opinion are likely to be, the subject of an infringement claim, Vendor shall, at its sole option and expense:

  (a) procure for Client the right to continue using the affected Services, Deliverables, or Work Product; or

  (b) modify or replace the affected Services, Deliverables, or Work Product so that they become non-infringing while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or

  (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected SOW or portion thereof and refund to Client the Fees paid for the affected Services or Deliverables, less a reasonable allocation for use prior to termination.

The obligations in this Section 8.4 constitute Vendor’s sole liability and Client’s exclusive remedy for any IP infringement claims, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in Article IX.

## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR DATA, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE).

9.2 **Liability Cap.** EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS (DEFINED BELOW), EACH PARTY’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO FIVE (5) TIMES THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CLIENT TO VENDOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12)-MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

9.3 **Excluded Claims.** The limitations in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 shall not apply to:

  (a) a Party’s indemnification obligations under Article VIII;

  (b) a Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under Article V;

  (c) Vendor’s violation of its data protection and security obligations under Article XI;

  (d) a Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct;

  (e) Vendor’s infringement or misappropriation of Client’s IP Rights.

For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing carve-outs are client-favorable and shall not be unreasonably construed to expand Vendor’s exposure beyond the specific contexts described above.

9.4 **Multiple Claims.** The existence of multiple claims or causes of action shall not enlarge the limitations of liability set forth in this Article IX.

9.5 **Risk Allocation.** The Parties agree that the limitations of liability and disclaimers of warranties in this Agreement form an essential basis of the bargain between the Parties, and that in the absence of such limitations, the economic terms of this Agreement would be substantially different.

Upon Client’s request, Vendor shall provide certificates of insurance evidencing the required coverage and shall provide at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice of any cancellation or material reduction in coverage.

10.3 **No Limitation.** Vendor’s maintenance of insurance as required in this Article X shall not limit or otherwise affect Vendor’s obligations or liability under this Agreement.

## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Laws relating to data protection, privacy, and data security, including but not limited to GDPR and CCPA, to the extent applicable to such Party’s activities under this Agreement.

11.2 **Role of the Parties.** To the extent Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of Client in the performance of the Services, the Parties acknowledge that, for purposes of Applicable Law, Client is the “controller” (or equivalent term) and Vendor is the “processor” (or equivalent term) of such Personal Data.

11.3 **Processing of Personal Data.** Vendor shall:

  (a) process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Client, which instructions are set forth in this Agreement and any SOW, and any additional documented instructions provided by Client from time to time, except as required by Applicable Law;

  (b) ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data are bound by appropriate confidentiality obligations;

  (c) implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, as required by Applicable Law and consistent with industry best practices.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Vendor shall not engage any subprocessor that will process Personal Data without Client’s prior written consent. Vendor shall enter into a written agreement with each subprocessor that imposes data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Article XI. Vendor shall remain fully liable for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors.

11.5 **Data Subject Requests.** Vendor shall promptly notify Client of any request received directly from a data subject relating to Personal Data processed under this Agreement and shall not respond directly to such requests except on Client’s documented instructions. Vendor shall provide commercially reasonable assistance to Client, at Client’s expense to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, in meeting Client’s obligations to respond to data subject requests.

11.6 **Data Breach Notification.** Vendor shall notify Client without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours, upon becoming aware of any actual or suspected unauthorized access to, acquisition of, or disclosure of Personal Data or Client’s Confidential Information in Vendor’s possession or control (a “**Data Breach**”). Such notice shall describe, to the extent known: the nature of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of affected data subjects and records, likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to address the Data Breach. Vendor shall cooperate fully with Client, at Vendor’s expense, in investigating, mitigating, and remediating any Data Breach, including fulfilling any notification or reporting obligations under Applicable Law as directed by Client.

11.7 **Cross-Border Transfers.** To the extent Vendor processes Personal Data subject to GDPR or similar laws and transfers such data outside the jurisdiction where it originated, Vendor shall ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with Applicable Law, including by entering into appropriate data transfer agreements (such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses or their successors) with Client, as required.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vendor shall retain Personal Data and Client’s Confidential Information only for as long as reasonably necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement or upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall promptly delete or return (at Client’s option) all Personal Data and Client’s Confidential Information, and certify such deletion, except to the extent retention is required by Applicable Law, in which case Vendor shall continue to protect such data in accordance with this Agreement.

11.9 **Assessments and Audits.** Upon Client’s reasonable request and not more than once per year (unless required by a Data Breach or regulatory inquiry), Vendor shall provide Client with information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set forth in this Article XI, which may include providing copies of relevant policies, summaries of audit reports, or responses to security questionnaires. Where reasonably necessary, Vendor shall allow Client or its designated third-party auditor (subject to confidentiality obligations) to conduct a security or privacy audit of Vendor’s facilities, systems, and procedures relevant to the Services, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Applicability.** To the extent any Services involve ongoing support, hosting, or managed services (e.g., monitoring and administration of hosted environments), the Service Levels in this Article XII shall apply, unless overridden or supplemented in an applicable SOW or separate SLA incorporated by reference.

12.2 **Uptime Commitment.** For any hosted or managed services specified in an SOW (the “**Managed Services**”), Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Managed Services are Available (as defined below) at least ninety-nine point nine percent (99.9%) of the time in each calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance (the “**Uptime Commitment**”). “**Available**” means that the Managed Services are accessible and materially functional for Client’s intended use.

12.3 **Scheduled Maintenance.** Vendor may perform routine system maintenance during scheduled maintenance windows, which shall be communicated to Client at least five (5) Business Days in advance. Scheduled Maintenance shall not exceed eight (8) hours per calendar month and shall not count as downtime for purposes of calculating availability.

12.4 **Incident Response Times.** Vendor shall respond to Client’s support requests relating to the Managed Services in accordance with the following target response times, measured from the time the issue is reported through Vendor’s designated support channel:

  - Severity 1 (Critical – system down, major business impact): Response within one (1) hour, 24x7.
  - Severity 2 (High – significant degradation, workaround available): Response within four (4) hours, during Business Days.
  - Severity 3 (Medium – moderate issue, minor impact): Response within one (1) Business Day.
  - Severity 4 (Low – informational or cosmetic issue): Response within two (2) Business Days.

12.5 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.** If Vendor fails to meet the Uptime Commitment in any calendar month, Client shall be entitled to service credits as follows:

  (a) Uptime between 99.0% and 99.9%: service credit equal to 5% of the monthly Fees for the affected Managed Services;

  (b) Uptime between 98.0% and 99.0%: service credit equal to 10% of the monthly Fees for the affected Managed Services;

  (c) Uptime below 98.0%: service credit equal to 20% of the monthly Fees for the affected Managed Services.

Service credits shall be applied to the invoice for the month following the month in which the SLA breach occurred and shall not be redeemable for cash. The service credits described in this Section 12.5 shall be Client’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for failure to meet the Uptime Commitment, without prejudice to Client’s right to terminate the relevant SOW for repeated failures as provided in Section 12.6.

12.6 **Chronic SLA Failures.** If Vendor fails to meet the Uptime Commitment in three (3) or more calendar months (whether or not consecutive) in any rolling twelve (12)-month period, Client shall have the right to terminate the affected SOW upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice without penalty, in addition to any other rights and remedies available to Client under this Agreement.

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may request changes to the scope, Specifications, Deliverables, Service Levels, timelines, or other aspects of the Services (each, a “**Change Request**”). Change Requests shall be documented in writing and submitted to the other Party’s project manager or designated representative.

13.2 **Impact Assessment.** Upon receipt of a Change Request, Vendor shall promptly assess the impact of the proposed change on the scope, Fees, timeline, resources, and any other relevant aspects of the Services. Vendor shall provide Client with a written impact assessment, including any proposed adjustments to the SOW, within a reasonable period, typically not exceeding ten (10) Business Days, unless otherwise agreed.

13.3 **Change Order.** No Change Request shall be effective unless and until the Parties agree in writing to a change order or amendment to the relevant SOW (a “**Change Order**”), signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. The Change Order shall specify the agreed changes, any adjustments to Fees, milestones, timelines, and other terms.

13.4 **Continuation of Work.** Unless otherwise instructed by Client in writing, Vendor shall continue to perform the Services in accordance with the existing SOW while the Parties evaluate or negotiate any Change Request.

13.5 **Urgent Changes.** In urgent situations where a delay in implementing a change could materially impact Client’s business operations or allow a security risk to persist, Client may request that Vendor proceed with certain changes in advance of a formal Change Order. Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate such requests, provided that the Parties agree in writing (including via email) on the scope and estimated impact, and subsequently execute a formal Change Order to memorialize the change.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its formation, interpretation, performance, breach, or termination (a “**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the Dispute through good faith negotiations between designated senior representatives of each Party.

14.2 **Escalation.** If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after written notice of the Dispute is provided by one Party to the other, the Dispute shall be escalated to executive-level representatives (e.g., Vice President or above) of each Party, who shall meet (in person or by video/teleconference) within fifteen (15) days thereafter to attempt to resolve the Dispute.

14.3 **Mediation.** If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after escalation under Section 14.2, either Party may propose non-binding mediation. If the Parties agree, they shall mutually select a mediator and conduct mediation in San Francisco County, California, within sixty (60) days of agreeing to mediate. The costs of mediation shall be shared equally by the Parties, excluding each Party’s own attorney’s fees and costs.

14.4 **Arbitration / Litigation.** In the absence of an agreement to mediate, or if mediation is unsuccessful, the Dispute shall be resolved as follows:

  (a) The Parties agree that any Dispute not resolved by negotiations or mediation may be brought in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts;

  (b) Nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking provisional or injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information or IP Rights pending resolution of the Dispute.

14.5 **Continued Performance.** During the pendency of any Dispute, Vendor shall continue to perform the Services and Client shall continue to pay undisputed amounts in accordance with this Agreement, unless this Agreement or the applicable SOW has been lawfully terminated.

## ARTICLE XV  
## FORCE MAJEURE

15.1 **Force Majeure Event.** Neither Party shall be liable for any delay or failure in performance (excluding payment obligations) to the extent caused by a Force Majeure Event, which shall mean any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, civil unrest, governmental actions, pandemics or epidemics (to the extent not reasonably foreseeable or preventable), labor disputes (excluding disputes involving the affected Party’s own workforce), power failures, telecommunication or internet outages not limited to a single location, or failure of third-party hosting providers.
