11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with the collection, use, disclosure, and processing of Personal Data under this Agreement. Gamma shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso and solely as necessary to perform the Services, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

11.2 **Data Processing Roles.** The Parties acknowledge that, for purposes of GDPR and analogous laws, Contoso is the **"controller"** and Gamma is the **"processor"** with respect to any Personal Data that Gamma processes on behalf of Contoso in connection with the Services.
