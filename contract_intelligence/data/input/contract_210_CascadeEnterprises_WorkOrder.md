  8.1.1 bodily injury, death, or damage to tangible property, to the extent caused by the negligence or wilful misconduct of Vendor or its personnel;

  8.1.2 Vendor’s material breach of this Work Order; or

Vendor shall have no obligation under this Section 8.2 to the extent the claim arises from:

  8.2.1 Client Materials, or modifications made by Client or at Client’s direction without Vendor’s approval;

  8.2.2 Client’s use of the Services or Deliverables in combination with any products, services, or materials not provided or approved in writing by Vendor, where the infringement would not have occurred but for such combination; or  

  8.2.3 Client’s use of the Services or Deliverables in breach of this Work Order or not in accordance with the Specifications.

If any such infringement claim is made or, in Vendor’s reasonable opinion, is likely to be made, Vendor may, at its own expense and in consultation with Client: (a) procure for Client the right to continue using the allegedly infringing item; (b) modify the item so that it becomes non-infringing, provided such modification does not materially degrade functionality; or (c) replace the item with a non-infringing item of substantially equivalent functionality. If none of the foregoing options is commercially reasonable, Client may terminate the affected portion of the Services and Vendor shall refund to Client any prepaid Fees for unused Services and Deliverables.

8.3 **Indemnification by Client.** Client shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Vendor and its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (collectively, the **“Vendor Indemnified Parties”**), from and against any Losses arising out of or in connection with:

  8.3.1 Client’s material breach of this Work Order; or  

  8.3.2 Client Materials or Client’s use of the Services or Deliverables in breach of applicable law or third-party rights.

8.4 **Indemnification Procedure.** The obligations of a Party to indemnify under this Article VIII are conditioned upon the indemnified Party:

  8.4.1 providing the indemnifying Party with prompt written notice of any claim for which indemnification is sought (provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent it is materially prejudiced thereby);

  8.4.2 granting the indemnifying Party sole control of the defence and settlement of the claim, provided that the indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim that imposes any admission, liability, or non-monetary obligation on the indemnified Party without the indemnified Party’s prior written consent; and  

  8.4.3 providing the indemnifying Party with reasonable cooperation, at the indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defence of the claim.
