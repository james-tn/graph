9.2.1 For claims arising **solely under this Addendum** (and not under the Parent Agreement generally), the total aggregate liability of each Party to the other, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed an amount equal to **one (1) times the Fees paid or payable by Contoso to Pinnacle under this Addendum during the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.

9.2.2 This provision constitutes a specific modification to Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement (which provides a cap of five (5) times the Fees for the prior twelve (12) months) for claims arising under this Addendum only, providing a more **client-friendly but still reasonable cap** given the low risk profile.

9.3 **Excluded Claims.** The exclusions from limitation in Section 9.3 of the Parent Agreement (indemnification obligations, gross negligence, willful misconduct, Pinnacle’s breach of confidentiality and data protection, Contoso’s payment obligations) shall apply to this Addendum, provided that punitive damages remain excluded where permitted by Applicable Law.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.** The Parties acknowledge that the limitations in this Article IX and Article IX of the Parent Agreement represent a fair allocation of risk and an essential basis of their bargain with respect to the Additional Services and Additional Deliverables.

10.2 **Certificates and Additional Insured.** Pinnacle shall, upon reasonable request, provide certificates of insurance evidencing such coverage and shall continue to name Contoso as an additional insured as required by Section 10.2 of the Parent Agreement.
