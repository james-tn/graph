## ARTICLE IV  
## FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

4.1 **Addendum Contract Value.**  

The aggregate maximum contract value for this Addendum (the “**Addendum Contract Value**”) is **Four Million Sixty‑Four Thousand Forty U.S. Dollars (US$4,064,040)**. The Parties acknowledge that this Addendum Contract Value is **in addition to** and separate from the **US$4,585,667** contract value referenced in **Section 3.1 (Contract Value)** of the Parent Agreement. The aggregate total potential exposure across the Parent Agreement and this Addendum may therefore exceed US$8,649,707.

Addendum Fees shall be composed of the following categories, in addition to the “Fees” contemplated in **Section 3.2** of the Parent Agreement:

  (a) **Subscription Fees for Extended Platform Modules.** Annual subscription fees for the Extended Platform Modules, billed in advance at the rates set forth in the applicable Addendum SOW or PO.  
  (b) **Implementation and Configuration Fees.** Fixed‑fee or time‑and‑materials charges for design, configuration, integration, and testing activities described in Article III.  
  (c) **Managed Services Fees.** Recurring monthly or annual fees for Managed Services, based on resource bands, system volume, and service tiers detailed in the Addendum SOW.  
  (d) **Training and Change Management Fees.** Fees for additional training sessions and change management support beyond those contemplated under prior SOWs.  
  (e) **Expenses.** Reimbursable travel and out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred by Meridian in connection with the Addendum Services, in accordance with **Section 3.6** of the Parent Agreement, as supplemented below.

4.3 **Payment Terms.**  

Notwithstanding **Section 3.3 (Payment Terms)** of the Parent Agreement, the Parties agree that, for all Addendum Fees:

  (a) Meridian shall invoice Contoso in accordance with the billing schedules set forth in the applicable Addendum SOW or PO, including milestone‑based invoicing where applicable;  
  (b) **All undisputed amounts invoiced under this Addendum shall be due and payable Net 60 days** from the date of invoice;  
  (c) All payments shall be made in U.S. dollars by wire transfer or as otherwise specified on the invoice; and  
  (d) Section 3.8 (Disputed Amounts) of the Parent Agreement shall govern disputes regarding invoices issued under this Addendum.

For avoidance of doubt, the **Net 60** payment term set forth herein applies solely to Addendum Fees and does not amend the **Net 45** term applicable to Fees under the Parent Agreement, unless the Parties expressly amend the Parent Agreement in a separate writing.

4.4 **Milestone Payments.**  

Where the Addendum SOW identifies fixed‑fee implementation milestones, **Section 3.4 (Milestone Payments)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply, subject to the following: Meridian may invoice the associated milestone fees upon substantial completion of the milestone and delivery of the corresponding Addendum Deliverables, irrespective of any non‑material outstanding items, provided Meridian promptly completes such items without additional charge.

4.5 **Late Payments.**  

The late payment provisions in **Section 3.5 (Late Payments)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to all Addendum Fees, including Meridian’s right to charge interest and suspend Addendum Services pursuant to **Section 4.5 (Suspension)** of the Parent Agreement. In view of the **High Risk** classification, Contoso acknowledges that Meridian may prioritize suspension of Addendum Services for non‑payment before suspending any other services.

4.6 **Expenses and Reimbursements.**  

Expenses shall be reimbursed consistent with **Section 3.6 (Expenses and Reimbursements)** of the Parent Agreement, except that for international travel or travel that exceeds US$10,000 in aggregate for a calendar quarter, Contoso shall provide written pre‑approval (which may be via email).

## ARTICLE V  
## TERM AND TERMINATION

5.1 **Addendum Term.**  

This Addendum shall commence on the Addendum Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Article V or the Parent Agreement, shall remain in effect until **January 14, 2030** (the “**Addendum Expiration Date**”).

5.2 **Renewal.**  

Any renewal or extension of the Addendum Term shall be mutually agreed by the Parties in writing. Renewals may be documented via written amendment to this Addendum or via new addenda or SOWs referencing the Parent Agreement and this Addendum, consistent with **Section 4.2 (Renewal)** of the Parent Agreement.

5.3 **Termination for Convenience.**  

Notwithstanding **Section 4.3 (Termination for Convenience)** of the Parent Agreement, the Parties agree that either Party may terminate this Addendum, in whole or in part, **for convenience upon not less than one hundred eighty (180) days’ prior written notice** to the other Party.

The 180‑day notice period in this Section 5.3 is intended to reflect the **High Risk** classification and is more favorable to Meridian than the sixty (60) day notice period in **Section 4.3** of the Parent Agreement.

5.4 **Termination for Cause.**  

The termination for cause provisions in **Section 4.4 (Termination for Cause)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to this Addendum, including for material breach and insolvency events.

5.5 **Effect of Termination; Relationship to Parent Agreement.**  

5.5.1 **Termination of Parent Agreement.** If the Parent Agreement is terminated or expires for any reason, this Addendum shall **automatically terminate** as of the effective date of such termination or expiration, unless the Parties expressly agree in writing to continue certain portions of the Addendum on an independent basis.

5.5.2 **Survival of Payment Obligations.** Upon termination or expiration of this Addendum for any reason, Contoso shall remain obligated to pay all undisputed Addendum Fees accrued and payable prior to the effective date of termination, including any non‑cancelable third‑party commitments.

5.5.3 **Consequences.** Sections 4.6 (Effect of Termination or Expiration) of the Parent Agreement shall apply to this Addendum mutatis mutandis, including termination of licenses, return or destruction of Confidential Information, and data return or deletion obligations, as further described in **Article XI** of this Addendum.

The exceptions and compelled disclosure provisions in **Sections 5.3 and 5.4** of the Parent Agreement apply equally here.

6.5 **Survival Period.**  

Notwithstanding **Section 5.6** of the Parent Agreement (which provides a five (5) year survival for confidentiality obligations, with extended protection for trade secrets and Personal Data), the Parties acknowledge and confirm that such survival applies equally to Confidential Information exchanged under this Addendum. In no event shall the confidentiality obligations hereunder terminate earlier than five (5) years after the later of: (a) termination/expiration of this Addendum; or (b) termination/expiration of the Parent Agreement.

  (a) Provide the Extended Platform Modules or any related configurations to any third party as a service bureau or shared service, except to its Affiliates authorized under the Parent Agreement;  
  (b) Attempt to gain access to source code, except to the extent expressly permitted by law and after providing Meridian with prior written notice and a reasonable opportunity to provide alternative means of achieving interoperability; or

7.6 **Residual Knowledge.**  

The residual knowledge provision in **Section 6.6** of the Parent Agreement applies equally here, permitting Meridian to use ideas, concepts, and know‑how retained in the unaided memory of its personnel, subject to confidentiality and data protection obligations.
