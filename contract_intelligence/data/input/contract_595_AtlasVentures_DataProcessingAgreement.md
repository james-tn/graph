Vendor shall:

(a) Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Client, including with respect to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or international organization, unless required to do so by applicable law, in which case Vendor shall inform Client of that legal requirement before Processing (unless legally prohibited);

Vendor shall not respond to such requests except on Client’s documented instructions or as required by law. Vendor shall provide reasonable assistance to Client, at Client’s expense, to enable Client to respond to such requests.

To the extent Vendor Processes Personal Data subject to the GDPR or other laws restricting data transfers outside certain jurisdictions, Vendor shall not transfer such Personal Data outside the applicable jurisdiction (e.g., the European Economic Area or the UK) unless it has implemented appropriate safeguards in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Laws (e.g., standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules) or the transfer is otherwise permitted by law. Upon Client’s request, the Parties shall execute any additional data transfer agreements or addenda required to legitimize such transfers.

### 11.6 Data Retention

Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services and fulfill the purposes described in this Agreement, or as required by applicable law.
