## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.**  
For purposes of Data Protection Laws, Company is the **Controller** (or “business” under CCPA) and Service Provider is the **Processor** (or “service provider” under CCPA) with respect to Personal Data. Service Provider shall Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Company, unless required to do so by Applicable Law.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.**  
Company’s instructions to Service Provider regarding the Processing of Personal Data are set forth in this Agreement and any SOWs. Company shall ensure that its instructions comply with Data Protection Laws. Service Provider shall promptly inform Company if, in Service Provider’s opinion, an instruction infringes Data Protection Laws.

11.3 **Subprocessing.**  
Company hereby authorizes Service Provider to engage Subprocessors for the Processing of Personal Data. Service Provider shall:

  (a) impose on Subprocessors data protection obligations at least as protective as those set forth in this Agreement; and

  (b) remain responsible for the performance of Subprocessors.

Upon reasonable request, Service Provider shall make available to Company a list of its then-current Subprocessors.

11.4 **Data Subject Requests.**  
Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Service Provider shall provide reasonable assistance to Company, at Company’s expense, in responding to Data Subject requests to exercise rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection), to the extent Company cannot reasonably fulfill such requests without Service Provider’s assistance. Service Provider shall promptly forward to Company any Data Subject request it receives relating to Client Data.

11.5 **Security Measures.**  
Service Provider shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, as required by GDPR Article 32 and other applicable Data Protection Laws. Such measures may include, as appropriate: encryption in transit and at rest; access controls; logging and monitoring; vulnerability management; and business continuity and disaster recovery procedures.

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Service Provider shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply with Applicable Law, or protect its legal interests. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, and upon written request by Company, Service Provider shall delete or anonymize Personal Data, except to the extent retention is required by law or necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

11.7 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed Personal Data breach affecting Client Data in the possession or control of Service Provider or its Subprocessors, Service Provider shall:

  (a) notify Company without undue delay and, where feasible, within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the breach;

  (b) provide information reasonably requested by Company to comply with its breach notification obligations under Data Protection Laws; and

  (c) take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of the breach and prevent recurrence.

Company shall be responsible for determining whether to notify Data Subjects, regulators, or others under Data Protection Laws.

11.8 **Audits.**  
Upon reasonable prior written notice and not more than once per twelve (12) month period (unless required by a supervisory authority or in the event of a material data incident), Company may audit Service Provider’s compliance with this Article XI by reviewing Service Provider’s relevant third-party security certifications or reports (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001). To the extent such documentation is insufficient to satisfy Company’s obligations, Company may, at its expense, conduct an on-site audit or engage an independent third-party auditor, subject to Service Provider’s reasonable security and confidentiality requirements.

11.9 **Cross-Border Transfers.**  
To the extent Service Provider Processes Personal Data subject to GDPR outside the European Economic Area, Service Provider shall ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place for such transfers, such as standard contractual clauses or other mechanisms recognized under Data Protection Laws.

12.2 **Measurement.**  
Uptime shall be measured on a calendar-month basis, using Service Provider’s monitoring tools and logs, and calculated as:

  (c) downtime resulting from Company’s misuse of the Services or failure to comply with this Agreement; and

  (d) emergency maintenance required to address security vulnerabilities or other critical issues, for which Service Provider will use reasonable efforts to provide advance notice.

12.4 **Support and Response Times.**  
Service Provider shall provide support services via email and online ticketing during Business Days. Target initial response times:

  (c) **Severity 3 (Medium)** – Non-critical issue, workaround available: initial response within 1 Business Day.

  (d) **Severity 4 (Low)** – General questions, minor issues: initial response within 3 Business Days.

Resolution times are not guaranteed but Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve issues promptly.

12.5 **SLA Remedies.**  
If Service Provider fails to meet the Monthly Uptime Percentage for a given month (excluding Permitted Downtime), Company shall be eligible for service credits as follows:

13.2 **Evaluation of Changes.**  
Upon receipt of a Change Request from Company, Service Provider shall evaluate its impact on scope, fees, schedule, resources, and technical feasibility, and shall respond in writing within a reasonable time (typically ten (10) Business Days) with:

  (a) a description of the impact on the Services;

  (b) any proposed amendments to fees, schedule, or assumptions; and

  (c) any additional terms or conditions reasonably necessary to implement the change.

13.4 **Impact on Fees and Timelines.**  
Company acknowledges that changes may result in increased fees and extended timelines. Service Provider shall not be obligated to proceed with any change until the Parties have executed a Change Order that addresses such impacts.

13.5 **Urgent Changes.**

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (“**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiations between designated executives with authority to resolve the Dispute. Either Party may initiate this process by providing written notice to the other Party describing the Dispute in reasonable detail.

14.2 **Mediation.**

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.**

  - **Litigation:** The Parties agree that any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in New York County, New York, and each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

14.4 **Injunctive Relief and Collection Actions.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information, Intellectual Property Rights, or Personal Data without first complying with the negotiation or mediation provisions of this Article XIV. Service Provider may also initiate collection actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover unpaid fees.

In any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs from the non-prevailing Party.
