Any undisputed amount not paid when due shall accrue interest from the due date until the date of payment at a rate equal to the lesser of: (a) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month; or (b) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. Phoenix’s right to interest is without prejudice to any other rights or remedies Phoenix may have under this Agreement or at law, including suspension of Services under Section 3.6.

If Contoso disputes any portion of an invoice in good faith, Contoso shall: (a) pay the undisputed portion by the due date; and (b) notify Phoenix in writing within fifteen (15) days of the invoice date, specifying the disputed amount and the basis for the dispute.

3.6 **Suspension for Non-Payment.**  
If any undisputed amount remains unpaid more than fifteen (15) days after the due date, Phoenix may, upon at least ten (10) Business Days’ prior written notice to Contoso, suspend all or part of the Services until all such amounts (and any accrued interest) are paid in full. Suspension under this Section 3.6 shall not be deemed a breach by Phoenix and Phoenix shall be entitled to an equitable extension of any affected deadlines.

3.7 **Expenses and Reimbursement.**  
Unless otherwise stated in a SOW, Contoso shall reimburse Phoenix for reasonable, pre-approved out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the performance of the Services, including travel, lodging, meals, shipping, and third-party fees.

Phoenix shall process Personal Data only:

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any SOW (a **“Dispute”**), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal discussions between their respective Project Managers.

14.2 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation and escalation as described above, the Parties shall endeavor to resolve the Dispute through non-binding mediation conducted under the auspices of a mutually agreed mediation provider in Seattle, Washington.

The Parties shall share equally the mediator’s fees and administrative costs, but each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and other costs.

14.3 **Arbitration / Litigation Venue.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved by mediation within sixty (60) days after the appointment of a mediator, then, **at Phoenix’s election**, the Dispute shall be resolved by either:

  (a) binding arbitration in Seattle, Washington, administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, with a single arbitrator; or  
  (b) litigation in the state or federal courts located in King County, Washington.

If Phoenix does not make such an election within thirty (30) days following the conclusion of mediation, the Dispute shall be finally resolved by litigation in the state or federal courts located in King County, Washington.

14.4 **Interim Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or emergency injunctive relief or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction at any time, without first engaging in negotiation, escalation, or mediation, in order to prevent irreparable harm, including for alleged breaches of confidentiality or Intellectual Property Rights.
