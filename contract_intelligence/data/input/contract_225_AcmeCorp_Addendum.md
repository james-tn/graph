## ARTICLE II  
## SCOPE OF SERVICES / WORK  

2.1 **Overview of Services.** Vendor shall provide to Client the Services described in this Article II and any applicable SOW issued under this Addendum. The Services generally include, but are not limited to: (a) design, configuration, and implementation of a cloud-based analytics and reporting solution; (b) systems integration with Client’s existing enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), and data warehouse systems; (c) ongoing managed services support, monitoring, and maintenance; and (d) related consulting, training, and documentation services.

2.2 **Detailed Description of Services.** Without limiting the generality of Section 2.1, the Services to be provided by Vendor shall include the following components:

2.2.1 **Solution Design and Architecture.** Vendor shall conduct discovery sessions with Client’s designated stakeholders to gather business requirements, technical constraints, and data sources. Vendor shall then design a scalable architecture for a cloud-based analytics solution, including data ingestion pipelines, storage layers, transformation processes, and visualization components. The architecture shall be documented in a Solution Design Document (SDD), which shall be deemed a Deliverable. The SDD shall include system diagrams, data flow diagrams, security and access models, and integration points.

2.2.2 **Configuration and Implementation.** Vendor shall configure the agreed analytics platform (which may include Vendor Proprietary Materials and Third-Party Materials) in accordance with the SDD. This shall include developing and configuring data connectors to Client’s ERP and CRM systems, setting up extract-transform-load (ETL) processes, defining data models, building standardized dashboards, and implementing role-based access controls. Vendor shall also perform initial data loads and validation in coordination with Client.

2.2.3 **Systems Integration.** Vendor shall integrate the analytics solution with Client’s existing IT systems, including secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., single sign-on), data warehouse integrations, and relevant APIs. Vendor shall follow industry-standard integration practices and shall ensure that integration components are tested in a non-production environment prior to deployment.

2.2.4 **Testing and Acceptance Support.** Vendor shall design and execute a testing plan including unit testing, system integration testing, performance testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) support. Vendor shall cooperate in good faith with Client to remediate defects that are identified during UAT. Acceptance criteria shall be set forth in the applicable SOW and, unless otherwise stated, will include the requirement that core dashboards load within a defined performance threshold and that data accuracy meets agreed tolerances.

2.2.5 **Training and Knowledge Transfer.** Vendor shall provide training sessions to Client’s designated users and administrators, which may include live (in-person or virtual) training, recorded training modules, and user documentation. Training content shall explain the functional use of the analytics solution, basic troubleshooting, and escalation procedures. Training materials shall be considered Deliverables.

2.2.6 **Managed Services and Support.** During the Term, Vendor shall provide ongoing support and maintenance for the deployed solution, including monitoring system health, identifying and resolving incidents, applying patches and updates to the underlying platform, and addressing Service Level incidents as set forth in Article XII. Vendor shall maintain a ticketing or case management system through which Client may report incidents, and Vendor shall respond within the response times specified therein.

2.2.7 **Enhancement and Optimization Services.** Vendor may, at Client’s request and subject to applicable Fees and Change Orders, design and implement enhancements, new dashboards, additional data sources, and other optimizations to the solution. Such enhancements will be governed by the Change Management procedures set forth in Article XIII.

2.3 **Deliverables.** By way of illustration and not limitation, the Deliverables under this Addendum may include:

- Solution Design Document (SDD);  
- Integration and Data Mapping Specifications;  
- Configured dashboards and reports;  
- ETL and data transformation scripts/configurations;  
- User and administrator documentation;  
- Training materials (slide decks, recorded sessions);  
- Operations manual and runbooks;  
- Periodic performance reports and SLA reports.

Each SOW shall specify the particular Deliverables to be provided, acceptance criteria, and timelines. In the event of any conflict between this Article II and an SOW, the SOW shall prevail solely with respect to the Deliverables and specific scope defined therein.

2.4 **Timelines and Milestones.** The Services shall be performed in phases and milestones as set forth in each SOW. By way of example, the Parties anticipate phases such as: (a) Discovery & Design (4–8 weeks), (b) Build & Configuration (8–12 weeks), (c) Testing & UAT (4–6 weeks), and (d) Go-Live & Stabilization (4 weeks). Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the timelines; however, any delays attributable to Client, including delays in providing access, information, or approvals, shall entitle Vendor to a reasonable extension of time and potential Fee adjustments as addressed in Article XIII.

2.5 **Performance Standards.** Vendor shall perform the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner, using personnel with appropriate skills, experience, and qualifications. Vendor shall comply with Applicable Laws and with any reasonable written policies of Client that are provided to Vendor in advance and expressly acknowledged in writing by Vendor. Service performance for the production environment shall be measured against the Service Levels defined in Article XII, which shall govern uptime, response times for incidents, and other performance metrics.

2.6 **Client Responsibilities.** Vendor’s obligations under this Addendum are contingent upon Client’s timely performance of its responsibilities, including but not limited to:

2.6.1 Providing Vendor with timely access to Client systems, data sources, environments, and personnel as reasonably required to perform the Services;  

2.6.2 Providing accurate, complete, and timely information and decisions necessary for the design and implementation of the solution;  

2.6.3 Designating a primary point of contact and decision-maker(s) with authority to approve Deliverables, Change Orders, and other matters;  

2.6.4 Maintaining appropriate internal backups of Client Data and ensuring that Vendor’s access to Client systems does not violate any third-party agreements to which Client is subject.

2.7 **Subcontractors.** Vendor may use subcontractors to perform the Services, provided that Vendor remains fully responsible for the performance of any subcontractor and ensures that any subcontractor is bound by obligations of confidentiality, data protection, and security no less protective than those set forth in this Addendum. Client hereby consents to Vendor’s use of subcontractors, including offshore subcontractors, provided that Vendor complies with applicable Data Protection Laws.

8.5 **Exclusive Remedy.** This Article VIII sets forth the Parties’ exclusive remedies and entire liability with respect to any intellectual property infringement Claims relating to the Services or Deliverables.

## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (HIGH-RISK, UNCAPPED, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDED)  

9.1 **No Cap on Liability (Vendor-Favorable but Uncapped Overall).** GIVEN THE HIGH-RISK NATURE OF THIS ENGAGEMENT, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THERE SHALL BE **NO CONTRACTUAL CAP ON THE LIABILITY** OF EITHER PARTY UNDER THIS ADDENDUM. HOWEVER, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, IN PRACTICE, MOST CLAIMS ARE EXPECTED TO RELATE TO THE USE OF THE SERVICES AND DELIVERABLES AND MAY BE MITIGATED THROUGH INSURANCE.

9.2 **Consequential Damages Included.** TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND IN LIGHT OF THE HIGH-RISK DESIGNATION OF THIS ENGAGEMENT, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE EXCLUDED FROM LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, EITHER PARTY MAY RECOVER, SUBJECT TO PROOF, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF DATA, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL) ARISING FROM A BREACH OF THIS ADDENDUM OR APPLICABLE LAW.

9.3 **Exceptions.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Article IX shall limit or exclude any liability that cannot be limited or excluded under Applicable Law, including liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by a Party’s negligence; (b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any other matter for which liability cannot be limited by law.

9.4 **Risk Allocation.** The Parties acknowledge that the Fees reflect, in part, the allocation of risk set forth in this Addendum and that the provisions of this Article IX are an essential element of the basis of the bargain between the Parties.

## CHANGE MANAGEMENT  

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may propose changes to the scope of Services, Deliverables, timelines, or other material aspects of this Addendum or any SOW (each a **“Change Request”**).
