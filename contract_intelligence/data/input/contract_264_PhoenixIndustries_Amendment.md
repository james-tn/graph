3.3.2 In addition, in light of Contoso’s operational needs and to enhance visibility and predictability of building management activities during the Amended Term, Phoenix shall provide the following **Extended Services**, which shall be deemed “Services” for all purposes of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment:

  (a) **Planned Preventive Maintenance (PPM) Schedule.** Within thirty (30) days of the Amendment Effective Date, Phoenix shall deliver to Contoso a rolling twelve (12)‑month PPM schedule covering building systems and common areas impacting the Premises, including indicative dates for major maintenance activities, consistent with Phoenix’s obligations under **Section 2.5.1 (Facilities Maintenance)**.

## ARTICLE IV  
FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

4.1 **Contract Value.**  
4.1.1 The Parties acknowledge that the estimated aggregate value of this Amendment over the Amended Term is **USD $1,030,880** (the “Contract Value (Amendment)”), which reflects adjustments to Rent and Service Fees during the period from the Amendment Effective Date through the Amended Expiration Date.  
4.1.2 The Parties further agree, consistent with **Section 3.1 (Contract Value)** of the Parent Agreement, that this Contract Value (Amendment) is a **non‑binding estimate** for internal and regulatory purposes only and does **not** cap or limit the amounts payable by Contoso under the Parent Agreement as amended.

4.2 **Revised Rent.**  
4.2.1 With effect from the Amendment Effective Date, the base Rent payable by Contoso to Phoenix under **Section 3.2.1 (Rent)** of the Parent Agreement shall be adjusted for the remainder of the Term as follows:

  (a) The annual base Rent for the Premises during the Amended Term shall be **USD $620,000 per Contract Year**, subject to indexation in accordance with **Section 3.2.2** of the Parent Agreement (CPI‑linked) as modified below.  

4.2.2 **Modification of Indexation Mechanism.** Notwithstanding **Section 3.2.2** of the Parent Agreement, from and after the Amendment Effective Date:

  (a) The annual CPI‑based adjustment shall continue to apply; however, the Parties agree that, for the Amended Term, any increase in Rent in a given Contract Year shall be capped at **4% per annum**.  

  (b) The provision in Section 3.2.2 entitling Phoenix to impose an increase of at least 3% per annum is hereby suspended for the duration of the Amended Term; instead, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith any adjustment where CPI exceeds 4%, but Phoenix shall not be entitled unilaterally to impose an increase greater than 4% in any Contract Year during the Amended Term.

4.2.3 All other terms of **Section 3.2 (Rent)** remain in force except as expressly modified in this Section 4.2.

4.3 **Revised Service Fees.**

4.4.1 The Parties hereby agree that **Section 3.5.2 (Invoicing and Payment – Net 30)** of the Parent Agreement is amended solely for the period from the Amendment Effective Date through the Amended Expiration Date as follows:

> “All invoices shall be payable by Contoso within **sixty (60) days** of the invoice date (‘Net 60’), without set‑off, deduction, or withholding, except as required by law.”

4.4.2 For the avoidance of doubt, **Section 3.5.1 (Invoicing)** and **Section 3.7 (Disputed Amounts)** continue to apply, save that all references to “thirty (30) days” for standard payment terms shall be construed as “sixty (60) days” during the Amended Term.

4.5 **Late Payment.**  
4.5.1 **Section 3.6 (Late Payment)** of the Parent Agreement shall remain in effect, provided that the determination of “late” payment shall now be measured by reference to the Net 60 Terms set out in Section 4.4 above.  
4.5.2 Phoenix shall continue to be entitled to charge interest on overdue amounts at the rate specified in **Section 3.6.1** (4% per annum above the base lending rate of the Bank of England).  
4.5.3 For purposes of **Section 3.6.2 (Persistent Late Payment)**, the assessment of “late payment of more than two (2) consecutive monthly invoices or any three (3) invoices in a rolling twelve (12)-month period” shall be based on the new due date (60 days from invoice date) and shall be construed reasonably and in good faith, recognizing the Low Risk Profile and the Parties’ desire to avoid termination for technical or minor payment delays.

4.6 **Expenses and Pass‑Through Charges.**  
4.6.1 **Section 3.4 (Additional Services and Pass-Through Charges)** of the Parent Agreement remains unchanged. Phoenix may continue to recharge utilities, property taxes, and insurance premiums attributable to the Premises as stated therein.

All amounts under this Amendment shall be invoiced and payable in United States Dollars (USD), and VAT and other applicable taxes shall continue to be borne by Contoso as specified in the Parent Agreement.
