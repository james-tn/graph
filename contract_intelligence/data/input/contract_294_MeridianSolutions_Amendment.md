## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY  

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.** The Parties acknowledge that, in relation to the processing of Personal Data under the Amended Agreement, Contoso acts as a data controller and Meridian acts as a data processor (as those terms are defined under Applicable Data Protection Laws), unless otherwise specified in a particular context.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.** Meridian shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international organisation, unless Meridian is required to do so by Applicable Law, in which case Meridian shall inform Contoso of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.

11.3 **Security Measures.** Meridian shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, as appropriate, measures such as pseudonymisation and encryption, ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems, and regular testing and evaluation of effectiveness.

11.4 **Sub-Processors.**  

11.4.1 Contoso authorises Meridian to engage sub-processors for the processing of Personal Data, provided that Meridian:  
(a) imposes on such sub-processors data protection obligations substantially equivalent to those set out in this Article XI; and  
(b) remains fully liable to Contoso for the performance of the sub-processors’ data protection obligations.

11.4.2 Meridian shall provide Contoso, upon reasonable request, with a list of current sub-processors involved in providing the Services. Meridian shall notify Contoso in advance of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of sub-processors, giving Contoso an opportunity to object on reasonable data protection grounds.

11.5 **Data Subject Rights.** Taking into account the nature of the processing, Meridian shall assist Contoso, by appropriate technical and organisational measures, in fulfilling Contoso’s obligations to respond to requests from data subjects exercising their rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws, including rights of access, rectification, erasure, and portability.

11.6 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a Data Breach involving Personal Data processed by Meridian on behalf of Contoso, Meridian shall:

(a) notify Contoso without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  
(b) provide Contoso with information reasonably required for Contoso to comply with its reporting obligations to supervisory authorities and affected data subjects; and  
(c) take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of the Data Breach and prevent a recurrence.

11.7 **Data Transfers.** To the extent Meridian or its sub-processors transfer Personal Data outside the United Kingdom (or outside the European Economic Area, as applicable) to a country not providing an adequate level of protection, the Parties shall ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, such as the execution of standard contractual clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms, in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Upon termination or expiry of the Amended Agreement or upon Contoso’s written request, Meridian shall, at Contoso’s choice, delete or return all Personal Data processed on behalf of Contoso, and delete existing copies, unless retention is required by Applicable Law. If retention is required, Meridian shall continue to ensure the confidentiality and security of the retained data in accordance with this Article XI.

11.9 **Audits.** Meridian shall make available to Contoso all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Article XI and, upon reasonable written notice and during normal business hours, allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by Contoso or its authorised auditor, provided that (a) such audits occur no more than once annually (unless mandated by a supervisory authority or in the event of a Data Breach) and (b) Contoso shall use reasonable endeavours to minimise disruption to Meridian’s business.

11.10 **CCPA/CPRA Compliance (if applicable).** To the extent the CCPA/CPRA applies, Meridian shall act as a “service provider” and shall not: (a) sell or share Personal Information (as defined in CCPA/CPRA); (b) retain, use, or disclose Personal Information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the Services or as otherwise permitted by law; or (c) combine Personal Information with personal information obtained from other sources, except as permitted by CCPA/CPRA.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS  

12.1 **Uptime Commitment.** For hosted production environments managed by Meridian under the Amended Agreement, Meridian shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the core Services are available at least **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and Permitted Downtime (the **“Uptime Commitment”**).

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.** Meridian may schedule maintenance windows that may affect Service availability, provided that:

(a) Meridian provides at least five (5) Business Days’ prior notice for planned maintenance that is reasonably expected to result in downtime exceeding thirty (30) minutes;  
(b) such maintenance is performed outside peak business hours where reasonably practicable; and  
(c) the total Scheduled Maintenance causing downtime does not exceed eight (8) hours in any calendar month, unless otherwise agreed.

12.3 **Incident Response and Resolution.** Meridian shall classify incidents according to severity levels (P1–P4) and respond in accordance with the following target times:

- **Priority 1 (Critical)** – Complete Service outage or severe degradation impacting all users or critical business functions:  
  - Response time: within one (1) hour of notification;  
  - Target resolution or workaround: within four (4) hours.

- **Priority 2 (High)** – Significant impairment affecting many users or major functions:  
  - Response time: within two (2) hours;  
  - Target resolution or workaround: within one (1) Business Day.

- **Priority 3 (Medium)** – Limited impact, affecting a subset of users or non-critical functions:

  - Response time: within two (2) Business Days;  
  - Target resolution or workaround: within ten (10) Business Days.

12.4 **Service Credits.**  

12.4.1 If Meridian fails to meet the Uptime Commitment in any calendar month, Contoso shall be entitled, upon written request made within thirty (30) days following the end of the month, to Service Credits calculated as a percentage of the monthly recurring fees for the affected Services, as follows (illustrative, subject to SOW refinement):

- Uptime ≥ 99.0% but < 99.9%: 5% credit  
- Uptime ≥ 98.0% but < 99.0%: 10% credit  
- Uptime < 98.0%: 20% credit

12.4.2 Service Credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall not be redeemable for cash. Service Credits are Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the Uptime Commitment, without prejudice to Contoso’s rights in the event of persistent or material failures constituting a material breach under Article IV.

12.5 **Exclusions.** Service Levels shall not apply to, and Meridian shall have no liability for failure to meet Service Levels to the extent resulting from:

(a) Contoso’s or its third-party suppliers’ acts or omissions;  
(b) Contoso’s breach of the Amended Agreement;  
(c) network or connectivity failures outside Meridian’s reasonable control;  
(d) Scheduled Maintenance or emergency maintenance (where Meridian uses reasonable endeavours to minimise impact and provide notice where practicable); or  
(e) Force Majeure Events as defined in Article XV.

## CHANGE MANAGEMENT  

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may request changes to the scope, nature, or timing of the Services or Deliverables (each a **“Change Request”**).

Until such time, the Parties shall continue to perform their respective obligations in accordance with the then-current SOW and Amended Agreement.

13.4 **Emergency Changes.** In urgent circumstances involving Service disruption or material security risks, Meridian may implement temporary changes reasonably necessary to stabilise or secure the Services without prior approval, provided that Meridian notifies Contoso as soon as reasonably practicable and the Parties work promptly to document any resulting changes through a Change Order.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION  

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with the Amended Agreement, including its existence, validity, or termination (a **“Dispute”**), the Parties shall first seek to resolve the Dispute through good faith negotiations between their respective operational managers.

14.3 **Mediation.** If the Parties’ senior representatives are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) Business Days after escalation, the Parties shall consider in good faith whether to attempt to resolve the Dispute through mediation under the auspices of the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) in London or another mutually agreed mediation provider.

14.4.2 The Amended Agreement and any Dispute shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles.

14.5 **Interim Relief.** Nothing in this Article XIV shall preclude either Party from seeking urgent or interim injunctive relief or other equitable remedies from a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or mitigate irreparable harm, including in relation to unauthorised use of Confidential Information or infringement of IPR.

16.5 **Waiver.** No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power, or remedy under the Amended Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise of it or the exercise of any other right. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by the waiving Party.
