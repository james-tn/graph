8.2 **Vendor Indemnification of Client.**

## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (HIGH RISK – NO CAP; CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDED)

9.1 **Supersession of Existing SOW Article IX for Amendment Scope.**

The Parties acknowledge that **Article IX of the Existing SOW** provides a **liability cap** (three (3) times the fees paid or payable in the preceding twelve (12) months) and exclusion of consequential damages, and that this Article IX of the Amendment is intended to modify that allocation **solely for the Amendment Services and Amendment Deliverables**. For the Amendment scope only, this **Article IX supersedes Article IX of the Existing SOW** and any inconsistent limitation of liability provisions in the Parent Agreement.

9.2 **No Cap on Liability for Amendment Scope.**

For all claims arising out of or relating to the Amendment Services, Amendment Deliverables, or this Amendment:

  **(a) There shall be no contractual cap on the aggregate liability of either Party.**  

Without limiting the foregoing, neither Party’s liability shall be limited by the amount of Amendment Fees paid or payable hereunder.

9.3 **Consequential and Other Damages Included.**

For claims arising out of or relating to this Amendment, neither Party shall be limited or excluded from recovering indirect, consequential, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or similar damages (including loss of profits, revenue, or data), whether or not foreseeable and whether or not such Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The Parties expressly agree that the exclusion of consequential damages set forth in **Section 9.3 of the Existing SOW** shall **not** apply to the Amendment scope.

9.4 **Exceptions (None as to Type of Damages).**

The exceptions to the existing limitations identified in **Section 9.4 of the Existing SOW** (including indemnification, confidentiality, and gross negligence/willful misconduct) remain applicable but are unnecessary for the Amendment scope because liability is uncapped and consequential damages are not excluded under this Article IX.

9.5 **Allocation of Risk.**

The Parties acknowledge that the Amendment Fees and the overall commercial arrangement reflect this High Risk allocation of liability and that the uncapped and comprehensive damages framework contained in this Article IX is a material inducement for Vendor to enter into this Amendment.

## ARTICLE X  
## INSURANCE

10.1 **Vendor Insurance Coverage.**

Vendor shall maintain the insurance coverage specified in **Article X of the Parent Agreement** throughout the Term of Amendment, including commercial general liability, professional liability (errors & omissions), cyber/privacy liability, and workers’ compensation, with coverage limits appropriate for the High Risk nature of the Amendment Services.

10.2 **Certificates of Insurance.**

Upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall provide certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with **Section 10.1 of the Parent Agreement**. Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Client of any cancellation or material reduction in coverage.

10.3 **Subcontractors.**

Vendor shall require any subcontractors performing material portions of the Amendment Services to maintain insurance coverage consistent with **Section 10.3 of the Parent Agreement**.

Vendor shall implement the technical and organizational security measures described in **Section 11.3 of the Parent Agreement**, and any additional measures specifically agreed in writing between the Parties for the Amendment Services. Vendor shall, at a minimum, implement appropriate encryption, access controls, and logging for systems involved in the Amendment Services.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.**

In the event of a personal data breach (as defined in **Section 11.7 of the Parent Agreement**) affecting Personal Data processed under this Amendment, Vendor shall notify Client without undue delay and cooperate with Client’s investigation and remediation efforts, in accordance with **Section 11.7 of the Parent Agreement**.

11.5 **Retention and Deletion.**

Upon termination or expiration of this Amendment, Vendor shall return or delete Personal Data processed under this Amendment in accordance with **Section 11.8 of the Parent Agreement**, subject to any legally mandated retention obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, Vendor may retain aggregated or anonymized data that does not identify any individual, for purposes such as analytics, benchmarking, and service improvement.

- Uptime 99.0% to < 99.9%: 5% credit  
- Uptime 98.0% to < 99.0%: 10% credit  
- Uptime < 98.0%: 20% credit  

Service credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall constitute Client’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for SLA failures, except where such failure results from Vendor’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, in which case Client may pursue additional remedies under **Article IX**.
