  (a) promptly notify the other Party (the “**Indemnifying Party**”) in writing of any Claim for which indemnification is sought, provided that failure to provide prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent materially prejudiced by such failure;  
  (b) permit the Indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of the Claim; and  
  (c) provide reasonable cooperation, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defense and settlement of the Claim.

  8.3.2 The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any admission of liability or any equitable relief or other obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnified Party may participate in the defense of any Claim with its own counsel at its own expense.

8.4 **IP Infringement Remedies.** In the event that the Work Product is, or in Stellar Dynamics’ reasonable opinion is likely to be, the subject of an IP infringement Claim, Stellar Dynamics may, at its option and expense:  

  (a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using the affected Work Product;  
  (b) replace or modify the Work Product so that it becomes non-infringing while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or  
  (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the applicable license to the Work Product and, upon Contoso’s return or destruction of the affected Work Product, refund to Contoso a pro rata portion of the Fees paid for such Work Product, depreciated on a straight-line basis over three (3) years from delivery.

8.5 **Exclusive Remedy.** The indemnity obligations set forth in this Article VIII, together with the IP infringement remedies in Section 8.4, shall be the Indemnified Party’s sole and exclusive remedy for any third-party IP infringement or misappropriation Claims, subject to the limitations of liability in Article IX.
