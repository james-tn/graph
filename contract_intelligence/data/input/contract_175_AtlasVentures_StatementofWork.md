## ARTICLE VIII  
## INDEMNIFICATION

The indemnification obligations in **Article VIII of the Parent Agreement** (Service Provider Indemnification, Company Indemnification, Exclusions, Indemnification Procedures, and Remedies for IP Infringement) apply to this SOW and are incorporated herein by reference. For clarity:

8.1 **Scope.**  

All references in Article VIII of the Parent Agreement to “this Agreement” shall be deemed to include this SOW. Claims arising from or relating to the Services and Deliverables under this SOW shall be subject to the same indemnification processes and limitations, including the exclusive remedy provisions of **Section 8.5 of the Parent Agreement** for IP infringement.

## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **General.**  

The limitations and exclusions of liability set forth in **Article IX of the Parent Agreement** apply to this SOW and are incorporated by reference, including:

- Exclusion of consequential damages (**Section 9.1**); and  
- General liability cap (**Section 9.2**), subject to the exceptions for indemnification, confidentiality breach, IP infringement, and gross negligence or willful misconduct.

9.2 **SOW-Specific Cap.**  

Notwithstanding Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement, and reflecting the low-risk classification of this SOW, the Parties agree that, with respect solely to claims arising out of or relating to this SOW (and not to other SOWs or engagements under the Parent Agreement), each Party’s aggregate liability to the other, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of:

(a) The amount specified in Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement (Fees paid or payable in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim); or  

(b) **Two (2) times the Fees paid and payable by Contoso to Atlas under this SOW during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**, provided that this SOW-specific cap does not apply to the exceptions enumerated in Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement.

For avoidance of doubt, where both this SOW and the Parent Agreement could apply, the more protective cap for Contoso (as Client) shall apply, consistent with the “Low” risk level.

Upon termination or expiration of this SOW, Personal Data shall be deleted or returned as specified in **Section 11.5 of the Parent Agreement**, subject to legal retention requirements.
