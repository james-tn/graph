Contoso shall reimburse Atlas for reasonable, pre-approved out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of on-site Services, including travel, lodging, and meals, provided that: (a) such expenses are incurred in accordance with Contoso’s then-current travel and expense policy shared in advance in writing; and (b) Atlas submits appropriate documentation and receipts.

Unless otherwise provided in an SOW:

3.8 **Late Payments.**  
If any undisputed amount is not received by Atlas by the due date, Atlas may, after giving written notice and a ten (10) Business Day cure period, charge interest on the overdue amount at a rate equal to the lesser of:

The Parties shall work in good faith to resolve such disputes. Contoso shall pay all undisputed portions of any invoice in accordance with **Section 3.7**. Non-payment of a disputed amount shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement while the dispute is being resolved in good faith.

  (c) use of the Software after Atlas notifies Contoso to stop use, if Atlas has provided a non-infringing alternative; or

  (d) Contoso’s failure to install an Update provided by Atlas that would have avoided the infringement, without materially reducing the functionality of the Software.

8.4 **IP Remedies.**  
If the Software is, or in Atlas’s reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement Claim, Atlas may, at its option and expense:

  (a) modify or replace the Software so that it is non-infringing while preserving substantially equivalent functionality;  

  (b) obtain for Contoso a license to continue using the Software; or  

  (c) if neither of the foregoing options is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected license and provide a pro rata refund of any prepaid, unused Fees for the affected Software.

8.5 **Indemnification Procedures.**  
The Party seeking indemnification (“**Indemnified Party**”) shall:

  (a) promptly notify the other Party (“**Indemnifying Party**”) in writing of the Claim (provided that delayed notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent materially prejudiced by such delay);

  (b) grant the Indemnifying Party sole control over the defense and settlement of the Claim (provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim that imposes any admission of liability or monetary obligation on the Indemnified Party without its prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld); and

  (c) provide reasonable cooperation and assistance at the Indemnifying Party’s expense.

8.6 **Exclusive Remedy.**  
The indemnification obligations set forth in this Article VIII, together with any associated refunds or credits, shall be the Indemnified Party’s sole and exclusive remedy, and the Indemnifying Party’s entire liability, with respect to third-party Claims covered by this Article VIII.

Atlas shall:

  (a) process Personal Data only for the purpose of providing the Services and in accordance with this Agreement and Contoso’s documented instructions;

Atlas shall respond to and use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve support incidents according to the following priority levels:

  - **Severity 1 (Critical)** – System is down or critical functionality unavailable with no workaround.  
    - Initial response: within 1 hour (24x7).

  - Availability < 99.0% and ≥ 98.0%: 10% credit  
  - Availability < 98.0%: 20% credit

To receive a service credit, Contoso must request it in writing within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the SLA breach occurred. Service credits shall be applied to future invoices and shall not be redeemable for cash, except in the event of termination, where outstanding credits shall be refunded.

12.6 **Exclusive Remedies.**  
The service credits described in this Article XII shall be Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy for Atlas’s failure to meet the Uptime Commitment, unless such failure constitutes a material breach giving rise to termination rights under **Section 4.4**.
