  (iv) such additional modules as may be set forth in an Order Form executed by both Parties.

(b) The Licensed Software shall be provided as a hosted, multi-tenant SaaS solution, accessible remotely via the internet. Client will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining its own compatible hardware, network connections, and internet access necessary to use the Software in accordance with Vendor’s then-current technical requirements.

2.3 **Authorized Users and Access.**  
(a) The License granted under this Agreement permits access to the Software solely by the number and category of Authorized Users specified in the applicable Order Form(s). Client shall ensure that each Authorized User is assigned unique login credentials and that such credentials are not shared or used by more than one individual.  

(b) Client shall be responsible for all activity occurring under Authorized User accounts and for compliance with this Agreement by all Authorized Users. Client shall promptly notify Vendor of any suspected unauthorized access to or use of the Software or any security incident involving Client’s accounts.

2.4 **Implementation and Configuration Services.**  
(a) Vendor shall perform implementation, configuration, and set-up Services to enable Client’s initial production use of the Software in accordance with the milestones and timelines set forth in a mutually executed SOW. Such Services may include requirements gathering, solution design, configuration of workflows, integration with Client’s existing systems, data migration planning, and user acceptance testing support.  

(b) Client acknowledges and agrees that Vendor’s performance of implementation and configuration Services is dependent on Client’s timely provision of: (i) accurate and complete information regarding Client’s business processes, systems, and data; (ii) access to relevant personnel and systems; and (iii) timely review and approval of project deliverables. Any delay or failure by Client to provide such cooperation may result in schedule delays and additional fees, as further described in Section 13.3.

2.5 **Customizations and Integrations.**  
(a) To the extent expressly set forth in an SOW, Vendor may develop certain customizations, integrations, or other Deliverables specifically for Client. Unless otherwise expressly stated in the applicable SOW, such Deliverables shall be designed solely for use in connection with the Software and may rely on or incorporate Vendor’s Pre-Existing IP.  

(b) Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete such Deliverables in accordance with the specifications, milestones, and acceptance criteria (if any) set forth in the applicable SOW. Client shall promptly test and evaluate any Deliverables provided for acceptance and shall provide written notice of acceptance or rejection, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for any rejection. If Client fails to provide such notice within ten (10) Business Days after delivery, the Deliverables shall be deemed accepted.

2.7 **Professional Services.**  
Beyond implementation and configuration, Client may request additional professional Services, including consulting, training, optimization, and extended integration work. Any such Services shall be reflected in a mutually executed SOW describing scope, deliverables, resource assumptions, and fee structure.

2.8 **Performance Standards.**  
Vendor shall perform the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner and in accordance with generally accepted industry standards for similar services. Client acknowledges that achievement of specific business outcomes (such as sales increases, cost savings, or regulatory approvals) is dependent on a variety of factors outside Vendor’s control, and Vendor does not warrant that such outcomes will be achieved by virtue of the Software or Services.

2.9 **Client Responsibilities.**

## ARTICLE XI  
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Laws relating to data protection, privacy, and information security, including, as applicable, the CCPA and GDPR. To the extent that Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of Client, the Parties shall enter into a separate data processing agreement (“DPA”) that complies with Applicable Law, and such DPA is hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement. In the event of conflict between this Agreement and the DPA regarding data protection obligations, the DPA shall control.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  
With respect to Personal Data contained in Client Data, Client shall be deemed the “controller” (or equivalent term under Applicable Law), and Vendor shall be deemed the “processor” or “service provider.” Client shall be responsible for the lawfulness of processing, including obtaining all required consents or authorizations and providing required notices to data subjects.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Client Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, taking into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing and the risks to data subjects.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized access to or disclosure of Client Data, including Personal Data, in Vendor’s possession or control (a “Security Incident”), Vendor shall:  
(a) notify Client without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Security Incident;  
(b) provide Client with timely information relating to the Security Incident, including the nature of the breach, categories of data affected, and measures taken or proposed to address the breach; and  
(c) cooperate with Client, at Client’s reasonable request and Vendor’s expense (to the extent the Security Incident is caused by Vendor’s breach of this Agreement), in any investigation, remediation, notifications, or other actions required under Applicable Law.

11.5 **Subprocessors.**  
Vendor may engage subprocessors to process Client Data on its behalf, provided that: (a) Vendor remains responsible for the acts and omissions of such subprocessors; and (b) Vendor enters into written agreements with such subprocessors imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth herein and in the DPA.

11.6 **Data Subject Requests.**  
To the extent legally permitted, Vendor shall promptly notify Client if it receives a request from a data subject to exercise rights under Applicable Law with respect to Personal Data within Client Data (e.g., access, deletion, rectification, portability). Vendor shall not respond to such requests except upon Client’s documented instructions or as required by Applicable Law. Vendor shall provide reasonable assistance to Client in responding to such requests, at Client’s expense, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

Vendor shall retain Client Data for the duration of the Term and for a period of up to ninety (90) days thereafter (“Retention Period”), unless a longer retention period is required by Applicable Law or agreed in writing.

## ARTICLE XII  
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS; SUPPORT

12.1 **Service Availability.**  
Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the production environment of the SaaS Software is available to Client at least **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding Permitted Downtime (“Availability Commitment”). “Permitted Downtime” includes:  
(a) planned maintenance windows, provided Vendor gives at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior notice;  
(b) emergency maintenance necessary to address critical security vulnerabilities;  
(c) downtime caused by Client’s or third-party systems, equipment, or networks;  
(d) force majeure events; and  
(e) other causes outside Vendor’s reasonable control.

12.2 **Measurement and Reporting.**  
Availability shall be measured by Vendor using industry-standard monitoring tools. Upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall provide a monthly report summarizing uptime performance. Any disputes regarding availability shall be resolved by reference to Vendor’s records.

12.3 **Support Tiers and Response Times.**  
Vendor shall provide Support Services for the Software in accordance with the following target response times (measured from the time Vendor receives Client’s support ticket during support hours):

- **Severity 1 (Critical)** – Complete outage or critical error causing significant business impact with no workaround: initial response within **1 hour** and continuous efforts until resolution or workaround.  
- **Severity 2 (High)** – Major functionality impaired with a workaround available: initial response within **4 hours** and commercially reasonable efforts to resolve.  
- **Severity 3 (Medium)** – Non-critical issue affecting some functionality: initial response within **1 Business Day**.  
- **Severity 4 (Low)** – General inquiries, minor issues, or feature requests: initial response within **2 Business Days**.

12.4 **Remedies for SLA Breach.**  
If Vendor fails to achieve the Availability Commitment for a given calendar month, Client may be eligible for service credits as follows:

- Availability between 99.0% and 99.9%: **2%** of the monthly subscription Fee for the affected Software;  
- Availability between 98.0% and 99.0%: **5%** of the monthly subscription Fee;  
- Availability below 98.0%: **10%** of the monthly subscription Fee.

Service credits shall be applied against future subscription Fees and shall not be redeemable for cash. Client must request service credits in writing within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the unavailability occurred. The service credits described herein shall be Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the Availability Commitment, except where such failure constitutes a material breach under Article IV.

12.5 **Support Exclusions.**  
Support Services do not include: (a) support for issues caused by Client’s misuse or unauthorized modifications of the Software; (b) support for third-party applications or systems not provided by Vendor; or (c) training beyond the scope specified in any applicable SOW.

CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.2 **Change Impact Assessment.**  
Upon receipt of a Change Request from Client, Vendor shall assess the impact of the requested change on scope, timeline, Fees, resources, and other relevant factors, and shall provide Client with a written proposal describing: (a) the modifications to the Services or Deliverables; (b) the estimated impact on the project schedule; and (c) any additional Fees or adjustments to existing Fees required.

13.3 **Change Orders.**  
No Change Request shall be binding unless and until the Parties execute a written change order or amendment (a “Change Order”) referencing this Agreement and, as applicable, the relevant SOW or Order Form. Vendor shall have no obligation to implement any requested change until a Change Order is fully executed. To the extent a Change Request from Client causes Vendor to incur additional time or costs or delays any milestone, the Parties shall adjust the Fees, timelines, and resource commitments accordingly in the Change Order.

13.4 **Urgent Changes.**  
In situations where urgent changes are required to address critical production issues or security vulnerabilities, Vendor may, upon oral or email authorization from Client’s designated project manager, implement limited changes prior to formal execution of a Change Order, provided that the Parties promptly memorialize such changes in writing within ten (10) Business Days.

## ARTICLE XIV  
DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or validity thereof (a “Dispute”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute by negotiation between executives who have authority to settle the Dispute. Either Party may initiate such negotiations by providing written notice to the other Party describing the nature of the Dispute.

14.2 **Escalation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days after the initiating Party’s notice, either Party may request escalation to senior management.

14.3 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation and escalation under Sections 14.1 and 14.2, the Parties agree to submit the Dispute to non-binding mediation before a mutually agreed mediator in **San Jose, California**. The mediation shall be conducted in accordance with the mediation procedures of a reputable mediation provider mutually selected by the Parties. The costs of mediation shall be shared equally by the Parties, except that each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and expenses.

If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days after appointment of the mediator (or such longer period as the Parties may agree), either Party may pursue its rights and remedies in accordance with Section 16.8 (Governing Law and Venue). The Parties agree that, unless otherwise agreed in writing, Disputes may be brought in the state or federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California, and each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief; Provisional Remedies.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction at any time to protect its Confidential Information or Intellectual Property Rights, or to prevent irreparable harm. The requirement to participate in mediation shall not be construed to limit any Party’s rights to seek such provisional relief.
