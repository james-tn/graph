Vendor shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Client and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, "**Client Indemnitees**"), from and against any and all third-party claims, demands, suits, or actions (collectively, "**Claims**") and any resulting damages, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) to the extent arising out of or relating to:

  (a) Allegations that the Work Product (excluding Client Materials and Third-Party Materials) infringes or misappropriates any third party’s Intellectual Property Rights;  
  (b) Vendor’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in performing the Services;  
  (c) Vendor’s material breach of its obligations under Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy); or  
  (d) Bodily injury or tangible property damage caused by Vendor’s personnel in connection with the Services.

8.2 **Client Indemnification.**  

Client shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Vendor and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, "**Vendor Indemnitees**"), from and against any and all Claims and resulting damages, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) to the extent arising out of or relating to:

  (a) Client’s gross negligence or willful misconduct;  
  (b) Client’s material breach of its obligations under this SOW, including Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy);  
  (c) Allegations that the Client Materials infringe or misappropriate any third party’s Intellectual Property Rights.

8.3 **Indemnification Procedures.**  

The indemnified Party shall:

  (a) Promptly notify the indemnifying Party in writing of any Claim (provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent prejudiced by such failure);  
  (b) Permit the indemnifying Party to assume the defense and settlement of the Claim, with counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnified Party; and  
  (c) Provide reasonable cooperation and assistance, at the indemnifying Party’s expense, in defending the Claim.

The indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any liability or obligation on the indemnified Party, or that involves any admission of fault by the indemnified Party, without the indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The indemnified Party may participate in the defense of the Claim with its own counsel at its own expense.

8.4 **IP Infringement Remedies.**  

If any Work Product (excluding Client Materials and Third-Party Materials) becomes, or in Vendor’s reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement Claim, Vendor may, at its option and expense:

  (a) Procure for Client the right to continue using the affected Work Product;  
  (b) Replace or modify the affected Work Product so that it is non-infringing, while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or  
  (c) If neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate Client’s rights to the affected Work Product and refund to Client the fees paid for such Work Product, less a reasonable allocation for the value received by Client prior to such termination.

This Section 8.4 sets forth Vendor’s entire liability, and Client’s exclusive remedy, for any Claim alleging infringement or misappropriation of Intellectual Property Rights.

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  

Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its performance or receipt of the Services under this SOW.

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.**  

Vendor shall:

  (a) Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Client, including as set forth in this SOW and any related data processing agreement or addendum between the Parties;  
  (b) Not “sell” or “share” Personal Data (as those terms are defined under the CCPA) and shall not use Personal Data for any purpose other than performing the Services;  
  (c) Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access;  
  (d) Ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data are bound by confidentiality obligations;

## ARTICLE XII  
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Applicability.**  

This Article XII applies to any managed services and ongoing support that Vendor provides under Phase 6 (if elected by Client) and documented in a Change Order or appendix. The SLA provisions are intended to be balanced, reflecting a medium risk profile.

12.2 **Availability.**  

Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the production Platform environment managed by Vendor (if applicable) is available **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and Excused Downtime (as defined below). Availability is measured as:

> Availability % = (Total minutes in month – Unscheduled Downtime minutes) / (Total minutes in month – Scheduled Maintenance minutes) × 100

12.3 **Scheduled Maintenance and Excused Downtime.**  

  (a) "**Scheduled Maintenance**" means maintenance activities that may result in temporary unavailability of the Platform and that Vendor schedules and provides at least forty-eight (48) hours prior written notice to Client. Vendor will use reasonable efforts to schedule such maintenance during off-peak hours.  
  (b) "**Excused Downtime**" includes unavailability caused by:  
   - Force Majeure Events;  
   - Client’s acts or omissions or those of its third-party vendors;  
   - Network or internet issues outside Vendor’s reasonable control;  
   - Non-production environments.

12.4 **Incident Response and Resolution.**  

Vendor shall respond to and use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve incidents according to the following target Service Levels:

  - **Priority 1 (Critical)**: Complete loss of service or severe impact on core business operations.  
    - Target Response Time: 1 hour (24x7)  
    - Target Workaround/Restoration: 4 hours  

  - **Priority 2 (High)**: Major functionality impaired with significant business impact.  
    - Target Response Time: 4 Business Hours  
    - Target Workaround/Restoration: 1 Business Day  

  - **Priority 3 (Medium)**: Partial loss of functionality or moderate business impact.  
    - Target Response Time: 1 Business Day  
    - Target Workaround/Restoration: 3 Business Days  

  - **Priority 4 (Low)**: Minor issues, cosmetic defects, or general questions.  
    - Target Response Time: 2 Business Days  
    - Target Workaround/Restoration: As mutually agreed.

12.5 **SLA Credits.**  

If Vendor fails to meet the Availability commitment in Section 12.2 in a given calendar month, Client shall be entitled to service credits as follows:

  - Availability between 99.0% and 99.9%: Credit of 5% of the monthly managed services fees;  
  - Availability between 98.0% and 99.0%: Credit of 10% of the monthly managed services fees;  
  - Availability below 98.0%: Credit of 15% of the monthly managed services fees.

Service credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall not be redeemable for cash. Service credits shall be Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for SLA failures, without limiting other remedies for material breaches not solely related to Service Levels.

## ARTICLE XIII  
CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  

Either Party may request changes to the scope of Services, Deliverables, timelines, or other terms of this SOW by submitting a written change request ("**Change Request**") to the other Party, describing the proposed change in reasonable detail.

13.2 **Evaluation of Changes.**  

Upon receipt of a Change Request from Client, Vendor shall:

  (a) Assess the impact of the Change Request on the scope, timeline, and fees;  
  (b) Provide Client with a written proposal containing the revised scope, estimated effort, schedule impact, and any adjustments to fees (the "**Change Proposal**");  
  (c) Use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Change Proposal within ten (10) Business Days, depending on the complexity of the request.

13.3 **Approval of Changes.**  

A Change Request shall become effective only when both Parties have agreed in writing to the Change Proposal (the resulting document being a "**Change Order**"). No Party shall be obligated to perform work beyond the original scope until the Change Order is executed. Email approval from authorized representatives may suffice for minor changes as agreed by the Parties.

13.4 **Effect on Fees and Timeline.**  

The Parties acknowledge that changes may require adjustments to the fees, milestones, and delivery timelines. Such adjustments shall be reflected in the applicable Change Order. Vendor shall not be required to absorb additional work without corresponding adjustments, and Client shall not be obligated to pay additional fees without an executed Change Order.

## ARTICLE XIV  
DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Informal Negotiation.**  

In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this SOW (a "**Dispute**"), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiations between designated executives. Either Party may initiate such negotiations by providing written notice of the Dispute to the other Party. The executives shall meet (in person or virtually) within fifteen (15) Business Days after such notice and shall attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days thereafter.

14.2 **Mediation.**  

If the Dispute is not resolved by informal negotiation within the timeframes set forth in Section 14.1, the Parties agree to attempt to resolve the Dispute through non-binding mediation before resorting to litigation or arbitration. Mediation shall be conducted in **San Francisco County, California**, before a mediator mutually agreed upon by the Parties, or, failing such agreement, appointed by JAMS or another reputable mediation organization. The costs of mediation shall be borne equally by the Parties, except that each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs.

14.3 **Litigation / Venue.**  

If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days from commencement of mediation, either Party may pursue remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties agree that:

  (a) Any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this SOW shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in **San Francisco County, California**;  
  (b) Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts and waives any objection that such courts are an inconvenient forum.

Nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking immediate injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or curtail actual or threatened misappropriation of Confidential Information or infringement of Intellectual Property Rights.

14.4 **Governing Law.**  

This SOW shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **State of California**, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the laws of any other jurisdiction to apply.

15.3 **Termination for Extended Force Majeure.**  

If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and materially affects a Party’s performance, either Party may terminate this SOW, in whole or in part, upon written notice to the other Party, without liability (except for payment of accrued and unpaid fees and expenses through the effective date of termination).
