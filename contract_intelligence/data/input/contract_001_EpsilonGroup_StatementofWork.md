## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Exclusion of Consequential Damages.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

9.2 **Cap on Liability.** SUBJECT TO SECTION 9.3, EACH PARTY’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CLIENT TO VENDOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

9.3 **Exceptions.** The limitations and exclusions set forth in this Article IX shall not apply to: (a) a Party’s indemnification obligations under Article VIII; (b) a Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under Article V; (c) Vendor’s breach of its data protection obligations under Article XI to the extent involving willful misconduct or gross negligence; or (d) a Party’s fraud or willful misconduct. For clarity, in respect of the exceptions in this Section 9.3, the exclusion of consequential damages in Section 9.1 shall not apply, but the overall cap in Section 9.2 shall continue to apply unless prohibited by applicable law.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.** The Parties acknowledge that the limitations of liability and exclusion of damages set forth in this Article IX are an essential basis of the bargain between the Parties and that, absent such limitations, the Fees and other terms of this Agreement would differ substantially.

  (a) process personal data only on documented instructions from Client, including with respect to transfers of personal data to a third country, unless required to do so by applicable law;

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a confirmed personal data breach affecting personal data processed by Vendor on behalf of Client, Vendor shall:

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)

12.1 **Availability Commitment.** Vendor shall provide the Solution with a minimum **monthly uptime of 99.9%**, excluding scheduled maintenance windows and emergency maintenance as agreed with Client. Uptime shall be calculated as:

  - **Priority 1 (Critical):** Complete loss of service or major business impact; no workaround available.  
    - Response time: within 1 hour, 24x7

  - Uptime below 98.0%: credit equal to 20% of the monthly support fees.

Service credits shall be applied against the next invoice(s) for support fees. Service credits are Client’s sole monetary remedy for SLA failures, without prejudice to Client’s right to terminate for material breach or to seek non-monetary remedies.

12.5 **Chronic SLA Failures.** If Vendor fails to meet the uptime commitment or the Priority 1 response/resolution times in three (3) or more consecutive months, or in four (4) or more months in any rolling twelve (12) month period, Client may, at its option, treat such failure as a material breach and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.4.2, without payment of any early termination fee.

12.6 **Exclusions.** SLA calculations shall exclude downtime or incidents caused by: (a) Client’s misuse or unauthorized modifications of the Solution; (b) failures in Client’s own systems or networks not under Vendor’s control; (c) Force Majeure Events; or (d) scheduled maintenance in accordance with Section 12.2.
