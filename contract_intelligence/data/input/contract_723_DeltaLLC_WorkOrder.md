8.4 **Mitigation for IP Claims.**

  (a) Procure for Contoso the right to continue using the affected Deliverables;  

  (b) Replace or modify the Deliverables so that they become non-infringing while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or

8.5 **Exclusions.**  
Delta shall have no obligation under **Section 8.1(a)** to the extent an IP infringement Claim arises from: (a) modifications to the Deliverables not made or authorized by Delta; (b) use of the Deliverables in combination with items not provided by Delta, where the Claim would not have arisen but for such combination; or (c) use of the Deliverables in breach of this Agreement or outside the scope of the Documentation.
