## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, including without limitation the **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**, as amended, and, to the extent applicable, the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679** and related implementing laws.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  
For purposes of applicable data protection laws: (a) Contoso is the “data controller” or “business” with respect to Client Data; and (b) Meridian acts as a “data processor” or “service provider” solely on behalf of Contoso. Meridian shall process Client Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, as set forth in this Agreement and applicable SOWs, except where otherwise required by law.

11.3 **Data Processing.**  
Meridian shall:

  (a) process Client Data solely for the purpose of providing the Services and Deliverables and as otherwise expressly authorized by Contoso;  
  (b) not “sell” or “share” Client Data (as such terms are defined under the CCPA) or use Client Data for targeted advertising or any purpose unrelated to the provision of Services;  
  (c) implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Client Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, consistent with industry standards;  
  (d) ensure that persons authorized to process Client Data are bound by confidentiality obligations; and  
  (e) assist Contoso, to the extent reasonably necessary and proportionate, in fulfilling its obligations to respond to data subject requests, conduct data protection impact assessments, and consult with supervisory authorities where required.

11.4 **International Transfers.**  
To the extent Meridian transfers Client Data outside the country of origin or the European Union/European Economic Area (if applicable), such transfers shall be made in compliance with applicable data transfer mechanisms, such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms, as agreed by the Parties in writing.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed unauthorized access to or disclosure of Client Data under Meridian’s control that constitutes a “personal data breach” or similar event under applicable law (a “**Data Breach**”), Meridian shall:

  (a) notify Contoso without undue delay and, in any event, within seventy‑two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  
  (b) provide Contoso with reasonably available information regarding the nature of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of affected data subjects and records, and the measures taken or proposed to address and mitigate the Data Breach; and  
  (c) cooperate with Contoso, at Contoso’s reasonable request and at Meridian’s expense, in any required notifications to data subjects or regulators and in remediation efforts, to the extent the Data Breach is caused by Meridian’s failure to comply with this Agreement.

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Meridian shall retain Client Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services or as required by applicable law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement or upon Contoso’s written request, Meridian shall, at Contoso’s option, return or securely delete all Client Data in its possession or control, subject to any legal retention obligations and the archival copy exception described in Section 5.5.

11.7 **Audit Rights.**  
Upon at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice and no more than once per year (unless required by a regulator or in response to a Data Breach), Contoso may audit Meridian’s compliance with this Article XI through review of Meridian’s then‑current independent security certifications or audit reports (e.g., SOC 2 Type II) and/or on‑site assessments. Any such audit shall be conducted during normal business hours, in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with Meridian’s business operations, and subject to Meridian’s reasonable security policies and confidentiality obligations.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Service Availability.**  
For any hosted or cloud‑based Services provided under this Agreement, Meridian shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Platform is available to Contoso at least **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and Excused Downtime (the “**Uptime Commitment**”).

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance and Excused Downtime.**  

  (a) **Scheduled Maintenance.** Meridian may schedule routine maintenance windows that may affect service availability, provided that Meridian gives Contoso at least forty‑eight (48) hours’ prior notice where feasible. Scheduled maintenance shall not exceed eight (8) hours per month and shall be excluded from uptime calculations.  
  (b) **Excused Downtime.** The Uptime Commitment shall not apply to downtime caused by: (i) Force Majeure Events; (ii) acts or omissions of Contoso or its third‑party providers; (iii) network or infrastructure failures outside of Meridian’s reasonable control; or (iv) Client’s misuse or unauthorized modification of the Platform.

12.3 **Support Response Times.**  
Meridian shall provide technical support to Contoso during normal business hours (Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time, excluding holidays) and, for critical incidents, on a 24x7 basis. Meridian will respond to support requests according to the following target response times:

  - **Severity 1 (Critical):** Complete loss of service or severe degradation affecting all users – initial response within one (1) hour;  
  - **Severity 2 (High):** Significant functionality impaired with no workaround – initial response within four (4) hours;  
  - **Severity 3 (Medium):** Partial or non‑critical loss of functionality – initial response within one (1) Business Day;  
  - **Severity 4 (Low):** General inquiries or minor issues – initial response within two (2) Business Days.

12.4 **Service Credits.**  
If Meridian fails to meet the Uptime Commitment in a given calendar month, Contoso shall be entitled to a service credit as follows:

  - Uptime between 99.0% and 99.9%: credit equal to 5% of the monthly subscription Fees applicable to the affected Services;  
  - Uptime between 98.0% and 99.0%: credit equal to 10% of such monthly Fees;  
  - Uptime below 98.0%: credit equal to 20% of such monthly Fees.

To receive a service credit, Contoso must submit a written request within thirty (30) days of the end of the month in which the failure occurred. Service credits shall be applied against future subscription Fees and shall not be redeemable for cash.

12.5 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.**  
Service credits as described in Section 12.4 shall be Contoso’s exclusive monetary remedy for Meridian’s failure to meet the Uptime Commitment. However, if Meridian fails to achieve at least 98.0% uptime for three (3) consecutive calendar months, or fails to meet the Uptime Commitment for five (5) or more months in any rolling twelve (12) month period, Contoso may terminate the affected Services for material breach under Section 4.4.1, following the applicable cure period, and receive a pro‑rated refund of any prepaid, unused Fees for the terminated Services.
