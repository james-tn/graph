7.2 **Vendor Warranties – Enhanced Services.** The Vendor warranties in **Section 7.2 of the Parent SOW** (professional and workmanlike performance, compliance with Applicable Law, conformity of the Platform to the SDD, and non‑infringement to Vendor’s knowledge) shall apply equally to the Enhanced Services and Enhanced Deliverables, subject to the following clarifications:

  7.2.1 Vendor warrants that the Enhanced Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with generally accepted industry standards for advanced analytics and multi‑region cloud deployments.

  7.2.2 Vendor warrants that the Enhanced Deliverables, when used in accordance with the documentation, will conform in all material respects to the Advanced Analytics Design Addendum and Multi‑Region Deployment Architecture Document.

7.3 **Client Warranties.** The Client warranties in **Section 7.3 of the Parent SOW** (rights to Client Data, non‑infringement, and compliance with Applicable Law in Client’s use of the Platform and Services) are reaffirmed and shall apply to all Client Data and use cases introduced under this Amendment, including new data sources and regional deployments.

7.4 **Warranty Remedies.** The remedies set forth in **Section 7.4 of the Parent SOW** for material, reproducible non‑conformities (re‑performance, correction, equitable alternatives, termination under Section 4.4, and refund of pre‑paid, unused Fees) shall constitute Client’s exclusive remedies for breach of the warranties under this Article VII, with respect to both the Parent SOW and this Amendment.

7.5 **Disclaimer.** The warranty disclaimer in **Section 7.5 of the Parent SOW** (no additional express or implied warranties, no guarantee of error‑free or uninterrupted operation) applies in full to this Amendment.

---

## ARTICLE VIII – INDEMNIFICATION

8.1 **Client Indemnification.** The Client indemnification obligations in **Section 8.1 of the Parent SOW** (breach of SOW, misuse of Services, infringement by Client Data, and gross negligence or willful misconduct) are reaffirmed and shall extend to Client’s use of the Enhanced Services and Enhanced Deliverables.

8.2 **Vendor Indemnification.** Vendor’s IP infringement indemnity in **Section 8.2 of the Parent SOW** is reaffirmed with respect to the Enhanced Services and Enhanced Deliverables. If any Enhanced Deliverable or component of the Platform, as used by Client in accordance with this Amendment and the Parent SOW, infringes a third party’s IP Rights, Vendor shall indemnify the Client Indemnitees as described in that section.

8.3 **Exclusions.** The exclusions and limitations on Vendor’s indemnity obligations in **Section 8.3 of the Parent SOW** (modifications by Client, combination with non‑Vendor products, Client’s breach, and compliance with Client’s specifications) shall apply to any infringement claims arising from the Enhanced Services.

8.4 **Mitigation Measures.** Vendor’s obligations to mitigate infringement risk in **Section 8.4 of the Parent SOW** (procure rights, replace or modify, or terminate affected Services with refund of pre‑paid unused Fees) shall apply to both the Parent SOW and this Amendment with respect to any Enhanced Deliverable or Enhanced Service alleged or determined to be infringing.

8.5 **Indemnification Procedures.** The indemnification procedures in **Section 8.5 of the Parent SOW** (prompt notice, control of defense, and cooperation) shall govern all indemnification claims under this Article VIII.

---

## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Modification of Parent SOW Liability Regime for Amendment Scope.** The Parties acknowledge that the Parent SOW, in **Article IX**, states that, in light of the high‑risk nature of the engagement, there shall be **no contractual cap or limitation on the aggregate liability** of either Party and that certain consequential damages may be recoverable. The Parties further acknowledge that, with respect to the Enhanced Services introduced by this Amendment and the Medium Risk Level applicable thereto, the Parties desire a more balanced allocation of risk.

9.2 **Cap on Liability for Enhanced Services.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in **Article IX of the Parent SOW**, and solely with respect to claims arising out of or relating to the Enhanced Services or Enhanced Deliverables under this Amendment, the aggregate liability of either Party to the other, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, shall **not exceed three (3) times the total Fees actually paid by Client to Vendor under this Amendment during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**. For clarity, Fees paid under the Parent SOW (exclusive of this Amendment) shall not be counted in calculating this cap.

9.3 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.** To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, and solely with respect to the Enhanced Services and Enhanced Deliverables, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of goodwill, or loss of data not subject to reasonable backup practices), even if advised of the possibility of such damages and regardless of the legal theory under which such damages may be sought.

9.4 **Exceptions to Limitations.** The limitations in **Sections 9.2 and 9.3** of this Amendment shall not apply to:  
  (a) a Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII** of the Parent SOW or this Amendment;  
  (b) a Party’s breach of **Article V (Confidentiality)** of the Parent SOW or this Amendment;  
  (c) a Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or  
  (d) Client’s payment obligations for Fees due and payable under this Amendment.

9.5 **Parent SOW Liability Unchanged for Original Scope.** For the avoidance of doubt, the uncapped liability regime and damage recoverability provisions of **Article IX of the Parent SOW** shall continue to apply in full to the original scope of Services and Deliverables under the Parent SOW (Phases 1–4), except that, to the extent a claim relates to both the original scope and the Enhanced Services and the Parties cannot reasonably segregate the respective contributions, the Parties shall use good faith efforts to allocate liability between the uncapped and capped regimes based on the predominant cause of the Losses.

9.6 **Essential Basis.** The Parties acknowledge that: (a) the introduction of a cap and exclusion of certain damages with respect to the Enhanced Services is a material factor in the pricing of this Amendment and the decision of each Party to enter into it; and (b) the uncapped liability regime for the original scope under the Parent SOW remains an essential basis of the bargain for that portion of the engagement.

## ARTICLE X – INSURANCE

10.1 **Vendor Insurance Requirements.** Vendor’s insurance obligations set forth in **Article X of the Parent SOW** (Commercial General Liability, Professional Liability/Technology E&O, Cyber Liability, Workers’ Compensation, and Umbrella/Excess Liability) apply fully during the Amendment Term. Given the increased reliance on multi‑region deployments and advanced analytics:

  10.1.1 Vendor shall ensure that its **Professional Liability / Technology E&O** and **Cyber Liability / Network Security and Privacy** policies expressly cover claims arising from AI‑driven services, multi‑region cloud hosting, and data processing contemplated by the Enhanced Services.

10.2 **Certificates of Insurance.** Upon Client’s reasonable request during the Amendment Term, Vendor shall provide updated certificates of insurance evidencing the coverage required under **Article X of the Parent SOW**, including any endorsements or riders added to address the Enhanced Services.

10.3 **Notice of Cancellation or Material Change.** Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that its insurers provide at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice of cancellation or material reduction in coverage to Client, in accordance with **Section 10.3 of the Parent SOW**, and shall promptly notify Client of any material change in coverage that could reasonably be expected to affect the Enhanced Services.

---

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Applicability of Parent SOW Data Protection Terms.** The data protection and privacy obligations in **Article XI of the Parent SOW** (Sections 11.1–11.7) apply in full to this Amendment, including Vendor’s role as "processor" or "service provider" and Client’s role as "controller" or "business" under GDPR and CCPA, respectively.

11.2 **Multi‑Region Data Protection.** In connection with multi‑region deployment:

  11.2.1 Vendor shall design and operate the multi‑region environments in accordance with Applicable Law in each Designated Region, including applicable data protection, cross‑border transfer, and data residency requirements.

  11.2.2 Where Client Data includes Personal Data of data subjects in the EU/EEA or other jurisdictions with data export restrictions, Vendor shall implement appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses, adequacy mechanisms, or equivalent) as may be required by Applicable Law, in coordination with Client.

11.3 **Security Measures – Enhanced Scope.** In addition to the security measures referenced in **Section 11.3 of the Parent SOW** (encryption, access controls, patching, and logical segregation), Vendor shall:

  11.3.1 Ensure that multi‑region deployments include region‑specific access controls and logging to maintain data segregation and traceability across regions.

  11.3.2 Implement security controls appropriate to AI‑driven workflows, including governance controls for model access, model change management, and model training data protection.

11.4 **Data Breach / Security Incident Notification.** The Data Breach notification obligations in **Section 11.4 of the Parent SOW** apply to all Security Incidents affecting Client Data processed in connection with the Enhanced Services. Notification timelines (within seventy‑two (72) hours of becoming aware) and cooperation obligations shall be measured region‑specifically where required by local law, and Vendor shall provide reasonably detailed information regarding the affected region(s), systems, and data sets.

11.5 **Data Retention and Deletion.** The data retention and deletion obligations in **Section 11.5 of the Parent SOW** apply to all Client Data processed in multi‑region environments. Upon termination or expiration of this Amendment or the Parent SOW, Vendor shall, at Client’s written election, delete or return all Client Data processed in connection with the Enhanced Services, subject to legal retention requirements and backup practices.

11.6 **Subprocessors.** Vendor’s use of subprocessors under **Section 11.6 of the Parent SOW** shall include any third‑party providers utilized for multi‑region hosting, AI infrastructure, or analytics tooling. Vendor shall remain responsible for the acts and omissions of such subprocessors as provided in the Parent SOW.

11.7 **CCPA and Similar Laws.** The CCPA‑specific provisions in **Section 11.7 of the Parent SOW** (no sale of Personal Data, processing limited to provision of Services, Client responsibility for consumer requests) apply to all Enhanced Services involving California residents or similar regimes in other jurisdictions, with Vendor providing reasonable assistance as required by law.

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)

12.1 **Application of Parent Service Levels.** The Uptime Commitment, permitted downtime, support tiers, and service credits set forth in **Article XII of the Parent SOW** apply to the Platform as a whole, including the Enhanced Services and multi‑region deployments, unless expressly modified in this Article XII.

12.2 **Multi‑Region Uptime Commitment.** Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain a monthly uptime percentage of at least **99.9%** for each production environment in each Designated Region, measured separately per region, excluding permitted downtime as described in **Section 12.2 of the Parent SOW**.

12.3 **Additional Support Considerations.** The support tiers and response times in **Section 12.3 of the Parent SOW** apply equally to issues arising from Enhanced Services. In addition:

  12.3.1 Regional critical incidents (Priority 1) impacting a material portion of users in any Designated Region shall receive the same target initial response within one (1) hour and continuous efforts until resolution or workaround.

  12.3.2 Vendor shall provide regionally aware support coverage, taking into account major time zones of the Designated Regions, using a follow‑the‑sun support model where practicable.

12.4 **Service Credits – Enhanced Services.** Service credits for failure to meet the Uptime Commitment shall be calculated as provided in **Section 12.4 of the Parent SOW** (5%, 10%, or 20% of the monthly support and Platform fee) but shall be applied pro rata to the Enhanced Support & Platform Fees in **Section 3.2.2 of this Amendment** for the affected region(s), as well as to the corresponding portion of support fees under the Parent SOW, where appropriate.

12.5 **Exclusive Remedy.** Service credits shall be Client’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for Vendor’s failure to meet the Uptime Commitment with respect to the Enhanced Services, except where such failure constitutes a material breach under **Section 4.4 of the Parent SOW**, in which case Client may pursue its termination rights and other remedies, subject to the limitation of liability in **Article IX of this Amendment**.

---

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Application of Parent Change Management Process.** The change management provisions in **Article XIII (Change Management)** of the Parent SOW apply to all changes relating to the Enhanced Services and Enhanced Deliverables, including changes requested by either Party that may affect scope, schedule, Fees, or other terms of this Amendment.

13.2 **Change Requests for Enhanced Services.** Either Party may submit a change request specific to this Amendment.

13.3 **Evaluation and Change Orders.** Vendor shall evaluate each change request and provide an impact assessment consistent with **Section 13.2 of the Parent SOW**. No change shall be effective unless documented in a Change Order signed by authorized representatives of both Parties, which shall expressly reference both the Parent SOW (Ref: SOW‑SUM‑202504‑052, contract_052) and this Amendment (Ref: AMD‑SUM‑202504‑114).

13.4 **Urgent Changes.** In urgent circumstances, the Parties may agree by email of authorized representatives to proceed with a change affecting Enhanced Services prior to execution of a formal Change Order, consistent with **Section 13.4 of the Parent SOW**, provided a confirming Change Order is executed as soon as reasonably practicable.

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Application of Parent Dispute Resolution Terms.** The dispute resolution provisions set forth in **Article XIV of the Parent SOW** (good faith negotiations, mediation, binding arbitration in Wilmington, Delaware, and injunctive relief carve‑out) apply in full to any Dispute (as defined in the Parent SOW) arising out of or relating to this Amendment.

## ARTICLE XV – FORCE MAJEURE

15.1 **Application of Parent Force Majeure Terms.** The definition of "Force Majeure Event" and the related provisions in **Article XV of the Parent SOW** (notice, suspension of obligations, and extended force majeure termination rights) shall apply equally to this Amendment.

15.2 **Multi‑Region Considerations.** For multi‑region deployments, a Force Majeure Event in one region shall excuse performance only in that region to the extent reasonably necessary, and Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reroute or shift workloads to unaffected regions where technologically feasible and consistent with data residency obligations.

15.3 **Extended Force Majeure.** If a Force Majeure Event affecting a material portion of the Enhanced Services in a given Designated Region continues for more than ninety (90) consecutive days, either Party may terminate the Enhanced Services as to that region upon thirty (30) days’ written notice, in accordance with **Section 15.4 of the Parent SOW**, without liability other than payment for Services performed and expenses incurred prior to the effective date of termination.
