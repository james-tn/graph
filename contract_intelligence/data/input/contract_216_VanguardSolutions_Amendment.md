9.1.2 **Consequential and Similar Damages Recoverable.** The exclusion of indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages in Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement shall **not apply** to this Amendment. Each Party may recover such damages to the extent they are reasonably foreseeable and not otherwise prohibited by applicable law.

9.1.3 The Parties acknowledge that the uncapped liability and availability of consequential damages reflect the negotiated **High‑Risk Profile**, increased consideration, and the expanded scope and criticality of the Enhanced Services and Expanded Premises.

9.1.4 For clarity, the limitations and exclusions of Article IX of the Parent Agreement shall continue to apply to claims arising solely under the Parent Agreement and not relating to this Amendment, unless the Parties subsequently agree otherwise in writing.

(a) Critical issues: initial response within **30 minutes**;  

(b) High priority issues: initial response within **2 hours**;
