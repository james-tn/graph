8.1 **Client Indemnification in Favor of Vendor.**  
Given the high-risk nature of the engagement and the Client’s responsibility for Client Data and its use of the Deliverables, the Client shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Vendor, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, “**Vendor Indemnitees**”) from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, suits, proceedings, damages, losses, liabilities, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) (collectively, “**Losses**”) arising out of or relating to:

  8.1.1 The Client’s use of the Services or Deliverables in violation of this Agreement or Applicable Law;  
  8.1.2 Any allegation that the Client Data or Client IP infringes or misappropriates any third-party Intellectual Property or privacy rights;  
  8.1.3 The Client’s breach of its obligations under Articles V (Confidentiality), XI (Data Protection and Privacy), or XII (Service Level Agreements), to the extent attributable to the Client’s acts or omissions; or  
  8.1.4 The Client’s failure to obtain necessary consents or authorizations for the processing of Personal Data by the Vendor.

8.2 **Vendor Indemnification in Favor of Client.**  
The Vendor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Client, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, “**Client Indemnitees**”) from and against any Losses arising out of or relating to any third-party claim alleging that the Services or Deliverables (excluding Client Data, Client IP, and third-party components provided by the Client) infringe or misappropriate any third-party Intellectual Property rights.

8.3 **Indemnification Procedures.**  
The indemnification obligations in this Article VIII are subject to the following:

  8.3.1 The indemnified Party shall promptly notify the indemnifying Party in writing of any claim for which indemnification is sought, provided that failure to provide prompt notice shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent it is materially prejudiced thereby.  
  8.3.2 The indemnifying Party shall have sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, provided that it shall not settle any claim that imposes a non-monetary obligation on the indemnified Party without the indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  
  8.3.3 The indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the indemnifying Party, at the indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defense of the claim.

8.4 **IP Infringement Remedies.**  
If the Services or Deliverables (excluding Client Data and Client IP) become, or in the Vendor’s reasonable opinion are likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, the Vendor may, at its option and expense: (a) procure the right for the Client to continue using the affected Services or Deliverables; (b) modify the Services or Deliverables so that they become non-infringing; or (c) replace the Services or Deliverables with functionally equivalent non-infringing services or deliverables. If none of the foregoing is commercially feasible, either Party may terminate the affected portion of the Agreement upon written notice, and the Client shall receive a pro rata refund of any prepaid Fees for the affected portion.
