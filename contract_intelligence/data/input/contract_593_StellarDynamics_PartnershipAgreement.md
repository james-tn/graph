(a) Pre-approved, reasonable, and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Stellar Dynamics in the performance of the Services, such as travel, accommodation, and related expenses, shall be reimbursed by Contoso in accordance with Contoso’s then-current travel and expense policies, provided such policies have been communicated to Stellar Dynamics in advance.
