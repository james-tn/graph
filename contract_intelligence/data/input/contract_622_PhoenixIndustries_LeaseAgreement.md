Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Laws relating to data protection and privacy, including, to the extent applicable, the **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**, the **California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)**, and, to the extent Contoso or Phoenix processes personal data of individuals located in the European Economic Area, the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**.

### 11.2 Roles of the Parties

To the extent Phoenix processes personal information on behalf of Contoso in connection with the Services (e.g., access control logs, visitor logs, CCTV footage), Phoenix shall act as a “service provider” under CCPA and/or a “processor” under GDPR, and Contoso shall act as “business” or “controller,” respectively.

Phoenix shall:

(a) Process personal information solely on Contoso’s documented instructions and for the purpose of providing the Services;  
(b) Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage;  
(c) Not sell or share personal information as such terms are defined under CCPA and CPRA.

### 11.3 Data Breach Notification

In the event Phoenix becomes aware of a confirmed unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal information in its possession relating to Contoso (“Data Breach”), Phoenix shall:

(a) Notify Contoso without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours, after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  
(b) Provide Contoso with all reasonably available information necessary to enable Contoso to comply with its legal obligations;  
(c) Cooperate in good faith with Contoso, at Phoenix’s expense to the extent the Data Breach is caused by Phoenix’s failure to comply with this Agreement, in investigating the Data Breach and implementing reasonable remedial measures.

### 11.4 Data Retention and Deletion

Phoenix shall retain personal information processed on behalf of Contoso only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Contoso’s lawful written request, Phoenix shall delete or return such personal information, unless further retention is required by law, in which case Phoenix shall continue to protect the information in accordance with this **Article XI**.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

### 12.1 Uptime and Availability

To the extent Phoenix provides building systems or services requiring continuous operation (e.g., access control systems, critical HVAC for server rooms as identified by Contoso), Phoenix shall use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve **99.9% uptime** on a monthly basis, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and Force Majeure Events.

### 12.2 Response Times

Phoenix shall adhere to the following target response times for building service requests:

(a) **Critical Issues** (life safety, major systems outage): Response within four (4) hours and commencement of remediation within eight (8) hours;  
(b) **High Priority Issues** (significant impact on business operations): Response within one (1) Business Day;  
(c) **Standard Issues** (minimal impact, routine maintenance): Response within two (2) Business Days.

### 12.3 Remedies for SLA Breaches

If Phoenix fails to meet the uptime or response time targets in a material and repeated manner (e.g., in two (2) or more consecutive months), and such failure materially impairs Contoso’s use of the Premises:

(a) Phoenix shall, upon Contoso’s written request, develop and implement a remediation plan;  
(b) Contoso may, following good-faith discussion, be entitled to a service credit in an amount mutually agreed based on the nature and impact of the SLA breach, not to exceed a reasonable portion of the monthly Service-related fees;  
(c) If Phoenix fails to materially cure repeated SLA breaches within sixty (60) days after Contoso’s written notice, Contoso may treat such failure as a material breach under **Section 4.3.2(a)**.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

### 14.1 Negotiation and Escalation

In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a “Dispute”), the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the Dispute through good faith negotiations between senior representatives.

Either Party may initiate this process by providing written notice of the Dispute to the other Party. The Parties’ designated senior representatives shall meet (in person or via teleconference) within fifteen (15) Business Days of such notice and attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days thereafter.

### 14.2 Mediation

### 14.3 Arbitration or Litigation

If the Dispute remains unresolved after mediation, either Party may pursue its rights and remedies as follows:

(a) For monetary claims not exceeding US$1,000,000, either Party may elect binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) then in effect, with the arbitration to be conducted in **San Francisco County, California** by a single arbitrator experienced in commercial real estate and services agreements; or  
(b) For other claims, either Party may initiate litigation in the state or federal courts located in **San Francisco County, California**, and the Parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.

The affected Party shall:

(a) Promptly notify the other Party in writing of the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, describing the nature, anticipated duration, and impact on its performance;

During the pendency of a Force Majeure Event, the affected Party’s obligations under this Agreement (other than payment obligations for amounts already due and payable) shall be suspended to the extent and for the duration that such obligations cannot be performed due to the Force Majeure Event.

If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and materially impairs either Party’s ability to perform a material portion of its obligations, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other Party, without penalty, except for payment of amounts accrued prior to termination.
