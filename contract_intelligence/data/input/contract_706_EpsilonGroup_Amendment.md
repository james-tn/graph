8.2 **Vendor Indemnification of Client.**  
Vendor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Client, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, **“Client Indemnitees”**) from and against any Claims arising out of or relating to:

(a) Vendor’s material breach of this Amendment; or  
(b) any allegation that the Subscription Services or Deliverables, when used by Client as permitted hereunder and without modification, infringe or misappropriate any U.S. patent, copyright, or trade secret of a third party.

8.3 **Exclusions to Vendor’s IP Indemnity.**  
Vendor shall have no obligation under Section 8.2(b) with respect to any Claim to the extent it arises from:

(a) Client Data or any materials provided by Client or a third party;  
(b) use of the Subscription Services or Deliverables in combination with any products, services, data, or technology not supplied by Vendor, where the Claim would not have arisen but for such combination;  
(c) modification of the Subscription Services or Deliverables by anyone other than Vendor or its authorized agents;  
(d) Client’s continued use of the Subscription Services or Deliverables after Vendor has notified Client to cease such use in order to avoid or mitigate an infringement claim; or  
(e) Client’s use of the Subscription Services or Deliverables not in accordance with this Amendment or the applicable documentation.

8.4 **Mitigation.**  
If any Subscription Service or Deliverable is, or in Vendor’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement Claim, Vendor may, at its option and expense:

(a) procure for Client the right to continue using the affected Subscription Service or Deliverable;  
(b) replace or modify the affected Subscription Service or Deliverable so that it becomes non-infringing while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or  
(c) if neither of the foregoing options is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected SOW and refund to Client any pre-paid, unused Fees applicable to the terminated portion.

8.5 **Indemnification Procedures.**  
The Party seeking indemnification (the **“Indemnified Party”**) shall:

(a) promptly provide written notice of the Claim to the indemnifying Party (the **“Indemnifying Party”**), provided that any delay shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent materially prejudiced by such delay;  
(b) permit the Indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of the Claim; and  
(c) reasonably cooperate in the defense, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense.

The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any obligation on, or admits liability on behalf of, the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent. The Indemnified Party may participate in the defense of any Claim with its own counsel at its own expense.

8.6 **Exclusive Remedy.**  
The indemnification rights set forth in this Article VIII shall be the Indemnified Party’s **exclusive remedy** with respect to Claims covered by this Article VIII, subject to Article IX (Limitation of Liability).
