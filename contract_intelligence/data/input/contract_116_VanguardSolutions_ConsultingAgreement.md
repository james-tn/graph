To reflect the high-risk allocation, the Parties further agree that, **NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY**, each Party may be liable to the other for **ALL FORMS OF DAMAGES**, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AND DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES, OR THE DELIVERABLES.

**9.3 Exceptions.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Article IX shall limit or exclude any Party’s liability for: (a) its indemnification obligations under Article VIII; (b) breach of its confidentiality obligations under Article V; (c) data protection obligations under Article XI; (d) infringement of the other Party’s Intellectual Property Rights; or (e) any matter for which liability cannot be limited or excluded under Applicable Law.

**9.4 Allocation of Risk.**  
The Parties acknowledge that the Fees and other terms of this Agreement reflect the allocation of risk set forth in this Article IX and that the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement without such allocation.

**11.1 Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Laws relating to data protection, privacy, and security, including, where applicable, **GDPR**, **CCPA**, and other similar laws. To the extent the Service Provider processes Personal Data on behalf of the Company under this Agreement, the Service Provider shall act as a “processor” or “service provider” (as such terms are defined under Applicable Law) and the Company shall act as a “controller” or “business,” respectively.

For purposes of this Agreement, **“Personal Data”** means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (or as otherwise defined under Applicable Law), which is provided by or on behalf of the Company to the Service Provider, or otherwise processed by the Service Provider, in connection with the Services.

**11.3 Processing and Instructions.**  
The Service Provider shall process Personal Data solely for the purpose of providing the Services and in accordance with the Company’s documented instructions, except where otherwise required by Applicable Law, in which case the Service Provider shall inform the Company of such requirement (unless prohibited by law). The Service Provider shall ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality.

**11.4 Security Measures.**  
The Service Provider shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, damage, alteration, or disclosure, taking into account the nature of the data and the risks involved.

**11.5 Subprocessors.**  
The Service Provider may engage subcontractors that process Personal Data (**“Subprocessors”**), provided that the Service Provider imposes on such Subprocessors data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Article XI.

**11.6 Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure, or destruction of Personal Data by the Service Provider or its Subprocessors (a **“Data Breach”**), the Service Provider shall: (a) notify the Company without undue delay after becoming aware of the Data Breach; (b) provide reasonable information regarding the nature of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of affected data subjects, and the likely consequences; and (c) cooperate reasonably with the Company, at the Company’s expense, in investigating and mitigating the Data Breach and in complying with applicable notification obligations.

To the extent required by Applicable Law and to the extent the Company cannot reasonably fulfill such obligations on its own, the Service Provider shall, upon the Company’s written request and at the Company’s expense, reasonably assist the Company in responding to requests from data subjects exercising their rights (e.g., access, rectification, deletion) with respect to Personal Data processed under this Agreement.

**11.8 Data Retention and Deletion.**  
The Service Provider shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes of the Services or as required by Applicable Law.

**11.9 Cross-Border Transfers.**  
To the extent the Services involve the transfer of Personal Data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions with data transfer restrictions, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards in accordance with Applicable Law (such as standard contractual clauses or other approved transfer mechanisms), as mutually agreed.

The Service Provider may perform scheduled maintenance during non-business hours. The Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least forty-eight (48) hours’ advance notice of any scheduled maintenance that is expected to result in downtime.

**12.3 Incident Response Times.**  
The Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to incidents as follows (measured from the time of notification by the Company):

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT

**13.1 Change Requests.**  
Either Party may, from time to time, request changes to the scope, specifications, schedule, or other aspects of the Services or Deliverables (each, a **“Change Request”**). Change Requests shall be made in writing and submitted to the other Party’s project manager.

**14.1 Negotiation and Escalation.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute through negotiations between their respective project managers.

The costs of the mediator shall be shared equally, and each Party shall bear its own costs.

**14.3 Litigation; Venue.**  
If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute through mediation within sixty (60) days after initiation of mediation, either Party may pursue any remedies available at law or in equity. Subject to any mandatory arbitration agreement expressly included in a SOW (if any), the Parties agree that any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state and federal courts located in **New Castle County, Delaware**, and each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection based on inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction.

**14.4 Injunctive Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive or other equitable relief at any time from any court of competent jurisdiction, to protect its Confidential Information, Intellectual Property Rights, or Personal Data, without first complying with the negotiation or mediation procedures set forth in this Article XIV.
