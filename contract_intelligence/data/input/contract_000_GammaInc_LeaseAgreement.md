In the event of any inconsistency between the descriptive text and the floor plan diagrams in **Schedule A**, the Parties shall confer in good faith to resolve such inconsistency; Vendor’s building measurements shall create a rebuttable presumption of accuracy.

2.2.3 Vendor reserves the right, upon reasonable prior written notice and without materially adversely affecting Client’s use, to make alterations to the building, common areas, or building systems, provided that such changes do not reduce the Leased Premises’ usable space or materially interfere with Client’s access and operations, except temporarily during necessary construction or maintenance.

### 2.3 Use of Leased Premises

2.3.1 Client shall use the Leased Premises solely for general office, administrative, technology, and related lawful business purposes, unless otherwise specified in **Schedule A** or as approved in writing by Vendor.

2.3.2 Client shall comply, and shall cause its employees, contractors, and visitors to comply, with all applicable laws, regulations, building rules, and reasonable policies communicated in writing by Vendor with respect to the Leased Premises, including any safety, security, and access control requirements.

2.3.3 Client shall not:  
(a) use the Leased Premises for any illegal or hazardous purpose;

Client shall be responsible for its internal office equipment, servers, and other devices.

2.4.2 **Maintenance and Repairs.**  
(a) Vendor shall maintain in good working order and repair, at Vendor’s expense (except as otherwise provided herein), the structural elements of the building, including foundations, roofs, exterior walls, load-bearing columns, and building systems serving multiple tenants (e.g., central HVAC, elevators, fire suppression).  
(b) Client shall be responsible for routine care of the interior of the Leased Premises (e.g., keeping space clean and free from debris) and shall promptly notify Vendor of any needed repairs.  
(c) Damage caused by Client’s negligence or willful misconduct shall be repaired at Client’s cost.

2.4.3 **Janitorial and Common Services.** Vendor shall provide building-wide janitorial services for common areas, as well as standard cleaning services for the Leased Premises on a regular schedule consistent with comparable Class A or B buildings in the locality, subject to reasonable variations and public holidays.

If specified in **Schedule B** (IT & Connectivity Services), Vendor shall provide Client with access to certain shared or dedicated IT infrastructure, including internet connectivity and cabling.

In the event Vendor anticipates any delay that may impact the Commencement Date or Client’s ability to occupy the Leased Premises, Vendor shall promptly notify Client in writing, and the Parties shall confer in good faith to implement mitigation measures.

2.6.1 Vendor shall perform the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner, in accordance with generally accepted standards for comparable commercial property management and in compliance with applicable laws and building codes.

The Parties shall execute any data processing addendum (“DPA”) reasonably required to comply with such laws, which shall be attached as **Schedule E**.

### 11.3 Security Measures

Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed under this Agreement.

### 11.4 Data Breach Notification

In the event Vendor becomes aware of a confirmed Personal Data breach affecting Personal Data processed on behalf of Client, Vendor shall:

11.4.1 Notify Client without undue delay and, where feasible, within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of such breach;

11.4.2 Provide Client with reasonably available information regarding the nature of the breach, categories of data affected, and steps taken or proposed to mitigate and remediate the breach; and

11.4.3 Cooperate with Client in fulfilling any data breach notification obligations to supervisory authorities or individuals affected, as required by applicable law.

### 11.5 Data Retention and Deletion

Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes of this Agreement or as required by applicable law. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall delete or return Personal Data in its possession or control, except to the extent retention is required by law or for legitimate archival purposes, in which case such data shall remain subject to the confidentiality and security obligations herein.

### 12.2 Response and Resolution Times
