9.1 **Specific Limitation for This Addendum.**  
Notwithstanding **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)** of the Parent Agreement, which the Parties acknowledge expressly provides for **uncapped liability** and includes special, indirect, incidental, and consequential damages, the Parties agree that, **solely with respect to the Additional Services and Additional Deliverables under this Addendum**, the following limitation of liability shall apply and shall prevail over any inconsistent provision in the Parent Agreement:

  (a) The aggregate liability of each Party to the other for any and all claims arising out of or relating to this Addendum, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, shall be limited to an amount equal to **two (2) times** the total Fees actually paid by Client to Vendor under this Addendum during the **twelve (12) months** immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim (or, if the Addendum has been in effect for less than twelve (12) months, two (2) times the Fees paid during such shorter period, annualized).

9.2 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  
To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, and solely for the Additional Services, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages; or for any loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunity, arising out of or in connection with this Addendum, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, even if such damages were foreseeable or the Party was advised of the possibility of such damages.

9.3 **Exceptions.**  
The limitations and exclusions set forth in this Article IX shall not apply to:

  (a) a Party’s liability for death or personal injury caused by its gross negligence or wilful misconduct;  
  (b) a Party’s liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;  
  (c) Client’s payment obligations under this Addendum; or  
  (d) a Party’s liability for breach of its confidentiality obligations under **Article V** or misappropriation of the other Party’s Intellectual Property Rights.

9.4 **Relationship to Parent Agreement.**  
For the avoidance of doubt, the uncapped liability and high‑risk terms in **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement continue to apply to the original scope of Services and Deliverables under the Parent Agreement, but the limitations in this Article IX shall govern exclusively with respect to the Additional Services and Additional Deliverables described in this Addendum.

  - Monthly uptime < 99.5% and ≥ 99.0%: credit equal to **10%**;  
  - Monthly uptime < 99.0%: credit equal to **20%**.

Service credits shall be applied to future invoices and shall constitute Client’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for failure to meet the Uptime Commitment and response times, without prejudice to Client’s right to terminate for chronic SLA failures in accordance with this Addendum and the Parent Agreement.

12.4 **SLA Reporting.**  
Vendor shall provide monthly SLA reports summarizing uptime, incident volumes, response/resolution metrics, and service credits (if any), as part of the Additional Deliverables.
