## SCOPE OF SERVICES / WORK

2.1 **General.** Vendor shall perform the Services and provide the Deliverables described in this Agreement and in each SOW. Each SOW shall be deemed incorporated into and governed by the terms of this Agreement.

2.2 **Nature of Services.** Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Services may include, as set forth in one or more SOWs:

  (a) technology and business process consulting, including assessment of Client’s current systems, infrastructure, and workflows;  

  (b) design, configuration, and implementation of software solutions, including integrations with Client’s existing platforms and third-party applications;  

  (c) development of custom features, scripts, interfaces, dashboards, and reports tailored to Client’s requirements;  

  (d) migration of data from legacy environments to new systems, including data mapping, validation, cleansing, and testing;  

  (e) project management, including coordination with Client stakeholders, third-party vendors, and other relevant participants;  

  (f) training and knowledge transfer to Client’s personnel, including preparation of training materials and user guides;  

  (g) ongoing operational support, maintenance, and managed services (e.g., monitoring, patching, incident handling, and change management) as further detailed in the applicable SOW; and  

  (h) any ancillary services reasonably required for the successful delivery of the foregoing.

2.3 **Statements of Work.** Each SOW shall, to the extent applicable, specify: (a) a detailed description of the Services and Deliverables; (b) milestones, timelines, and delivery dates; (c) acceptance criteria for Deliverables; (d) responsibilities of each Party; (e) assumptions, dependencies, and prerequisites; (f) applicable Service Levels; and (g) Fees and payment milestones. The Parties acknowledge that, for a high-risk engagement, SOWs may be complex, multi-phased, and subject to change through the Change Management process described in Article XIII.

2.4 **Performance Standards.**  

  (a) Vendor shall perform the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner, in accordance with industry standards and Applicable Law, and using personnel with appropriate skills and experience.  

  (b) Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet or exceed the timelines, milestones, and Service Levels set forth in the applicable SOW. Time is not of the essence unless expressly stated in a particular SOW, and any deadlines are subject to adjustment under Article XIII and in the event of delays caused by Client, its Affiliates, or third parties under Client’s control.  

  (c) Vendor shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the manner and means by which the Services are performed, including the assignment of personnel and use of subcontractors (subject to Section 16.9); provided that Vendor shall remain responsible for the performance of the Services in accordance with this Agreement.

2.5 **Client Responsibilities.** Vendor’s performance is expressly conditioned on the following Client obligations, each of which is material:

  (a) Client shall provide timely access to its premises, systems, hardware, software, networks, personnel, and relevant documentation, as reasonably requested by Vendor and necessary for Vendor to perform the Services.  

  (b) Client shall designate a primary project manager and key stakeholders with decision-making authority and shall ensure timely review, feedback, and approvals of Deliverables, plans, and other items submitted by Vendor.  

  (c) Client shall promptly perform all tasks and obligations identified in the applicable SOW, including provision of Client Materials and completion of any prerequisite activities.  

  (d) Client shall promptly notify Vendor in writing of any issues, defects, or concerns relating to the Services or Deliverables.  

  (e) Client acknowledges that Vendor’s ability to perform the Services is dependent upon Client fulfilling its responsibilities and obligations hereunder. Vendor shall not be liable for any failure to meet its obligations (including Service Levels and timelines) to the extent caused by (i) Client’s failure to perform its obligations; (ii) inaccuracies or deficiencies in the Client Materials; or (iii) actions or omissions of Client’s other vendors or third parties under Client’s control.

2.6 **Deliverable Acceptance.**  

  (a) Each SOW may set forth a specific acceptance process and criteria for Deliverables. In the absence of such specified process, the following default process shall apply:

  - Upon delivery of a Deliverable, Client shall have ten (10) Business Days (the “**Review Period**”) to review and either (i) accept the Deliverable in writing, or (ii) reject the Deliverable by providing written notice describing in reasonable detail the material non-conformities with the applicable specifications.  

  - If Client fails to provide such written notice within the Review Period, the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted as of the last day of the Review Period.  

  (b) If Client timely rejects a Deliverable due to material non-conformity, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformity and resubmit the Deliverable. Client shall have an additional Review Period to review the corrected Deliverable under the same procedure.  

  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any use of a Deliverable in a live production environment or for commercial purposes (other than testing) shall constitute acceptance of such Deliverable.

2.7 **High-Risk Engagement Acknowledgment.** Client acknowledges that the project(s) contemplated under this Agreement involve complex technology, organizational change, and integration of systems and processes, and therefore present a high level of risk. In light of such risk, the Parties agree to: (a) maintain close communication and governance; (b) document key assumptions and dependencies in each SOW; and (c) accept that project plans and timelines may require adjustment pursuant to Article XIII. The allocation of risk between the Parties, including indemnities and limitations (or lack thereof) on liability, is set forth in Articles VIII and IX.

Vendor’s obligation to notify is not an acknowledgment of fault or liability.

11.7 **Data Subject Requests.** To the extent reasonably necessary and legally permitted, Vendor shall assist Client in responding to data subject requests (e.g., access, deletion, portability) relating to Personal Data processed by Vendor on Client’s behalf. Client is responsible for handling such requests and for determining the appropriate response at all times.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination of the Services involving Personal Data, Vendor shall, at Client’s written election, delete or return Personal Data, except where retention is required by law or for legitimate business purposes (e.g., archiving, dispute resolution), subject to continued protection under this Agreement.
