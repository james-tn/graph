(d) compliance by Service Provider with Client’s specific written instructions or specifications, where the alleged infringement would not have occurred but for such instructions or specifications.

8.4 **Indemnification Procedure.**  
The Party seeking indemnification (the **“Indemnified Party”**) shall:

(a) promptly notify the other Party (the **“Indemnifying Party”**) in writing of any Claim for which it seeks indemnification, provided that failure to provide prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent it is prejudiced thereby;  

(b) grant the Indemnifying Party sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim that imposes any admission of fault, liability, or payment obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and  

(c) provide the Indemnifying Party with reasonable cooperation and assistance, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defense of the Claim.

8.5 **Mitigation.**  
In the event of an infringement Claim covered by **Section 8.1**, Service Provider may, at its option and expense:

(a) procure for Client the right to continue using the allegedly infringing Work Product;  

(b) modify the Work Product so that it becomes non-infringing while substantially preserving its functionality; or  

(c) replace the Work Product with a non-infringing alternative of substantially equivalent functionality.

If none of the foregoing options is commercially reasonable in Service Provider’s judgment, Service Provider may terminate the relevant SOW and refund to Client the Fees paid for the infringing Work Product, less a reasonable allowance for use, in which case Client shall cease all use of the Work Product.

8.6 **Sole Remedy.**  
THIS ARTICLE VIII SETS FORTH THE PARTIES’ SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES AND THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS.
