## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Modification of Parent Agreement Risk Allocation for this SOW.**  

The Parties acknowledge that **Article IX of the Parent Agreement** provides for **uncapped liability** and express inclusion of consequential damages in light of a “High-Risk Engagement.” However, for this **Low Risk Classification** SOW, and pursuant to **Section 2.2(c) of the Parent Agreement**, the Parties agree to the following **Client-favorable** limitation of liability, which shall control in the event of any conflict with **Article IX of the Parent Agreement** with respect to claims arising under or relating to this SOW only.

9.2 **Liability Cap.**  

Except as provided in Section 9.4 below, and to the maximum extent permitted by law, the aggregate liability of each Party to the other for all claims, damages, and losses arising out of or related to this SOW, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall not exceed **three (3) times the total Fees paid or payable by Contoso to Phoenix under this SOW during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.

9.3 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  

Except as provided in Section 9.4 below, **neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, punitive, exemplary, or special damages, or for any loss of profits, loss of business, or loss of data**, arising out of or in connection with this SOW, even if such Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. For clarity, **consequential damages are excluded** under this SOW, in contrast to Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement.

9.4 **Exceptions to Limitations.**  

The limitations and exclusions in Sections 9.2 and 9.3 shall not apply to:  
  (a) a Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII of the Parent Agreement and this SOW**;  
  (b) a Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under **Article V of the Parent Agreement and this SOW**;  
  (c) a Party’s gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct; or  
  (d) Contoso’s obligation to pay Fees and reimbursable expenses in accordance with **Article III of the Parent Agreement and this SOW**.

9.5 **Risk Allocation.** The Parties acknowledge that the limitation of liability and exclusion of damages set forth in this Article IX are an essential element of the consideration for this SOW and that, in the absence of such provisions, the economic terms of this SOW (including the SOW Contract Value) would be substantially different.
