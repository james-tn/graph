2.2 **Overview of Expanded Licenses and Services.**  
(a) **Expanded Licenses.** Under this Amendment, Contoso shall procure from Gamma, and Gamma shall provide to Contoso, additional licenses or subscriptions to Gamma’s enterprise Platform (the “Platform”) as described in **Section 2.2 (Software Provision)** of the Parent Agreement.

2.3 **Detailed Description of Amendment Scope.**  
(a) **Implementation and Integration.** The Expanded Services shall include, at a minimum:

  (i) Analysis of Contoso’s updated business and technical requirements for additional regions and business units;  
  (ii) Extension and reconfiguration of existing solution designs established under prior Parent SOWs, to support new workflows, data models, and integration points;  
  (iii) Development and testing of additional interfaces with Contoso’s legacy and third-party systems, including, where applicable, increased throughput and performance tuning to accommodate the Expanded Licenses;  
  (iv) Enhancements to existing data migration strategies to incorporate new data sources, with validation and reconciliation steps; and  
  (v) Support for additional User Acceptance Testing (UAT) cycles, regression testing, and performance testing for new use cases.

(c) **Maintenance and Support for Expanded Scope.** The Expanded Licenses and Amendment Deliverables shall be supported under the same maintenance and support regime as set out in **Section 2.6 (Maintenance and Support)** and **Article XII (SLA)** of the Parent Agreement. Uptime commitments, incident response times, and service credit remedies under **Sections 12.2 – 12.5** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to the Expanded Licenses on the same basis as the existing deployed Platform.

2.4 **Milestones and Project Plan.**  
(a) Gamma shall update the Project Plan to incorporate the Expanded Services, including key Milestones for design completion, integration development, test cycles, and go-live dates. Such Project Plan, once agreed in writing (including by email) by the Parties’ project managers, shall be deemed incorporated into this Amendment by reference.

(b) Milestones will be structured similarly to those described in **Section 1.13 (Milestones)** and **Section 3.4 (Milestone-Based Payments)** of the Parent Agreement. Gamma acknowledges that **time is of the essence** with respect to critical Milestones, consistent with **Section 2.7** of the Parent Agreement, where Contoso’s strategic initiatives depend on timely deployment.

2.5 **Performance Standards.**  
The Services under this Amendment shall be performed in accordance with the same performance standards cited in **Section 2.7 (Performance Standards)** of the Parent Agreement, namely:

(a) in a professional and workmanlike manner and in accordance with generally accepted industry standards;  
(b) in compliance with Applicable Law, including privacy and data protection laws referenced in **Section 1.7** and **Article XI** of the Parent Agreement; and  
(c) in accordance with the timelines, Milestones, and Service Levels specified herein and in any relevant Parent SOWs.

2.7 **Client Responsibilities.**  
Contoso shall continue to fulfill its responsibilities as set forth in **Section 2.9 (Client Responsibilities)** of the Parent Agreement, including providing access to relevant personnel, environments, and systems needed for the Expanded Services. To the extent Contoso’s failure to perform such responsibilities causes or contributes to delays, Gamma shall not be liable for any related failure to meet Milestones or Service Levels, provided Gamma has given timely written notice of such dependencies, consistent with the Parent Agreement.

2.8 **Statements of Work Under Parent Agreement.**  
This Amendment shall serve as a **commercial and quantitative overlay** to existing SOWs and purchase orders executed under the Parent Agreement. To the extent a specific SOW is identified in an annex to this Amendment, the quantities, pricing, and related Milestones in such SOW shall be deemed amended in accordance with this Amendment. Where a conflict exists between an SOW and this Amendment with respect to quantities or pricing, **this Amendment shall prevail**, and the Parent Agreement shall continue to prevail over both except to the extent expressly modified herein, consistent with **Section 2.10(c)** of the Parent Agreement.

## ARTICLE III  
FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Relationship to Parent Agreement Fees.**  
This Amendment is specifically intended to **modify quantities or pricing** within the scope of **Article III (Fees and Payment Terms)** of the Parent Agreement. Except as expressly set forth herein:

(a) The fee structure principles in **Section 3.2** of the Parent Agreement—covering license/subscription fees, implementation/professional Services fees, maintenance/support fees, and hardware fees—shall remain applicable to the Expanded Licenses and Expanded Services.  
(b) The invoicing requirements in **Section 3.3(c)** of the Parent Agreement (including reference to Contract Reference No. PUR-GAM-202510-133) shall apply, and invoices issued in connection with this Amendment shall clearly reference **both** the Parent Agreement (Ref: PUR-GAM-202510-133 / contract_133) and this Amendment (Ref: AMD-GAM-202510-176).

3.1A **Amended Contract Value (Modification of Section 3.1 of Parent Agreement).**  
Notwithstanding **Section 1.6** and **Section 3.1** of the Parent Agreement, the Parties hereby agree that, upon execution of this Amendment:

- The “Contract Value” as defined in **Section 1.6** of the Parent Agreement and stated in **Section 3.1** thereof (**US$3,839,415**) is **hereby replaced in its entirety** with a revised aggregate maximum contract value of **US$3,250,136** (three million two hundred fifty thousand one hundred thirty-six United States dollars), which shall be deemed the new “Contract Value” for all purposes under the Parent Agreement as amended, including for references in **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)** of the Parent Agreement, where applicable.  

For clarity, this Amended Contract Value reflects **rebaselining of quantities and pricing** pursuant to this Amendment and supersedes the prior Contract Value for the combined scope of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment.

3.2 **Amendment Fees Structure.**  
(a) **Software License/Subscription Fees.**  
The Expanded Licenses shall be billed in accordance with the following:

  (i) Additional annual or multi-year license/subscription fees shall be calculated based on the updated quantities and unit prices set out in the Updated Rate Card and/or annexes to this Amendment;  
  (ii) Where pre-existing license terms under the Parent Agreement have multi-year pricing commitments, the incremental fees for the Extended Licenses shall be coterminous with those periods, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

(b) **Implementation and Professional Services Fees.**  
The Expanded Services shall be invoiced primarily on a **time-and-materials** basis at the rates specified in the Updated Rate Card, subject to any cap or estimate expressly stated in the relevant annex. Gamma shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide estimates of required effort and shall notify Contoso if Gamma reasonably anticipates exceeding any agreed estimate, so that the Parties may manage scope and cost in accordance with **Article XIII (Change Management)** of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment.

(c) **Maintenance and Support Fees.**  
Maintenance and support fees for the Expanded Licenses shall be calculated as a percentage (consistent with percentages used under the Parent Agreement) of the then-current Expanded License fees, invoiced annually in advance, in line with **Section 3.2(c)** of the Parent Agreement.

(d) **Hardware Fees (If Applicable).**  
If any additional hardware is required and agreed by the Parties in relation to the Expanded Licenses, such hardware shall be priced and invoiced on a one-time basis in accordance with **Section 3.2(d)** and **Section 2.3** of the Parent Agreement.

3.3 **Net 60 Payment Terms (Modification of Section 3.3(b) of Parent Agreement).**  
Notwithstanding **Section 3.3(b)** of the Parent Agreement (which stipulates Net 45 terms), as between the Parties and solely with respect to invoices issued under or expressly referencing this Amendment:

- All undisputed amounts shall be **due and payable within sixty (60) calendar days** from the date of receipt by Contoso of a correct and undisputed invoice (“**Net 60**”), and  
- The reference to “forty-five (45) calendar days” in **Section 3.3(b)** of the Parent Agreement shall, as to invoices under this Amendment, be deemed replaced by “sixty (60) calendar days.”

For the avoidance of doubt, **this Net 60 modification applies only to invoices relating to the scope and fees of this Amendment**; all other invoices under the Parent Agreement not expressly tied to this Amendment shall continue to be subject to the Net 45 terms in the Parent Agreement.

3.4 **Late Payments.**  
The provisions of **Section 3.7 (Late Payments)** and **Section 3.8 (Disputed Amounts)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to this Amendment, except that the “due date” for purposes of calculating interest shall be based on the **Net 60** term described in **Section 3.3** above.

3.5 **Expenses and Reimbursement.**  
Gamma shall be responsible for its own expenses in performing Services under this Amendment, except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing. Any reimbursable travel or out-of-pocket expenses must:

(a) be pre-approved in writing by Contoso;  
(b) comply with Contoso’s applicable travel and expense policies, as referenced in **Section 3.6** of the Parent Agreement; and  
(c) be supported by appropriate receipts and documentation.

3.6 **Taxes.**  
All fees under this Amendment are exclusive of applicable taxes, which shall be handled in the same manner as set forth in **Section 3.5 (Taxes)** of the Parent Agreement.

- Contoso may terminate this Amendment, in whole or in part, **for convenience** upon not less than **one hundred eighty (180) days’ prior written notice** to Gamma, in light of the broader deployment scope and vendor-favorable risk allocation under this Amendment.

(b) **Termination by Gamma.** Gamma may terminate this Amendment for convenience upon not less than **one hundred eighty (180) days’ prior written notice** to Contoso, provided that either (i) no active Milestones or critical deployment phases under this Amendment remain in effect as of the proposed termination date, or (ii) Contoso provides written consent to terminate such activities.

(c) For clarity, termination of this Amendment for convenience under this **Section 4.2** shall not, by itself, terminate the Parent Agreement, which shall continue in accordance with its terms unless separately terminated.

4.3 **Termination for Cause.**  
The termination for cause provisions in **Section 4.4 (Termination for Cause)** and **Section 4.5 (Termination for Persistent SLA Failures)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply equally to this Amendment. Either Party may terminate this Amendment (and, if specified in the notice, the Parent Agreement) upon the occurrence of a material breach described in **Section 4.4**, subject to the cure periods therein.

4.4 **Effect of Termination of Parent Agreement.**  
If the Parent Agreement is terminated or expires for any reason:

(a) This Amendment shall automatically terminate as of the effective date of termination or expiration of the Parent Agreement, unless the Parties expressly agree in writing that specific provisions or elements of the Expanded Licenses shall survive;  
(b) The effect of termination shall be governed by **Section 4.6 (Effect of Termination)** and **Section 4.7 (Transition Assistance)** of the Parent Agreement, including payment of fees for Services performed and Deliverables accepted up to the effective date of termination, subject to any rights of set-off or credits arising from Gamma’s breach; and  
(c) Any prepaid fees under this Amendment for periods following such termination shall be refunded on a pro-rata basis in accordance with **Section 4.6(c)** of the Parent Agreement, unless termination is due to Contoso’s uncured material breach.

4.5 **Effect of Termination of Amendment Only.**  
If this Amendment is terminated without termination of the Parent Agreement:

(a) Contoso shall pay Gamma for all Amendment Deliverables properly delivered and accepted and for applicable Expanded Services performed as of the effective date of termination;  
(b) Ongoing license rights under the Expanded Licenses may, at Gamma’s election, be **either** (i) terminated concurrently, or (ii) continue through the remainder of the then-current license term upon Contoso’s payment of applicable license and support fees; and  
(c) All other terms of the Parent Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the original (pre-Amendment) scope.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (HIGH RISK – NO CAP; CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDED)

9.1 **Uncapped Liability (Superseding Section 9.1 of Parent Agreement for Amendment Scope).**  
Notwithstanding **Section 9.1 (Cap on Liability)** of the Parent Agreement (which caps each Party’s aggregate liability at two (2) times the fees paid or payable in the preceding twelve (12) months), the Parties agree that, **with respect to any and all claims arising out of or in connection with this Amendment, the Expanded Licenses, the Expanded Services, and the Amendment Deliverables, there shall be NO CONTRACTUAL MONETARY CAP on either Party’s liability.** Any references to a contractual liability cap in **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement shall not apply to claims arising under or relating to this Amendment.

Notwithstanding **Section 9.2 (Exclusion of Certain Damages)** of the Parent Agreement, and in light of the High Risk allocation agreed by the Parties:
