For purposes of Data Protection Laws, Contoso is the Controller (or Business) and Titan is the Processor (or Service Provider) with respect to Personal Data Processed under this Agreement.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.**  
Titan shall Process Personal Data only on behalf of Contoso and in accordance with: (a) this Agreement; (b) the Underlying Agreement; and (c) Contoso’s documented lawful instructions, as communicated from time to time. Titan shall notify Contoso if it reasonably believes that an instruction from Contoso violates Applicable Law, and Titan may decline to follow such instruction until the Parties resolve the issue.

11.3 **Data Protection Compliance.**  
Titan shall comply with Data Protection Laws applicable to its role as Processor. Contoso shall comply with Data Protection Laws applicable to its role as Controller, including providing appropriate notices to Data Subjects and obtaining any required consents or authorizations.

11.4 **Technical and Organizational Measures.**  
Titan shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures shall include, as appropriate: (a) encryption in transit and at rest where feasible; (b) access controls and authentication mechanisms; (c) physical security measures; (d) regular vulnerability assessments; (e) logging and monitoring of access to Personal Data; and (f) employee training on data protection and security.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a Security Incident involving Personal Data:

  (a) Titan shall notify Contoso without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of a Security Incident that is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of Data Subjects;

  (b) Such notice shall describe, to the extent known: (i) the nature of the Security Incident; (ii) the categories and approximate number of Data Subjects and records concerned; (iii) the likely consequences; and (iv) the measures taken or proposed to be taken to address the Security Incident and mitigate its adverse effects;

  (c) Titan shall promptly investigate the Security Incident, take appropriate steps to remediate it, and cooperate reasonably with Contoso and any supervisory authorities as required under Data Protection Laws; and

  (d) Except as required by Applicable Law, Titan shall not make any public announcement or notification to Data Subjects relating to the Security Incident without Contoso’s prior written approval.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.**  
Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Titan shall assist Contoso, to the extent reasonably possible, in fulfilling Contoso’s obligations to respond to Data Subject requests under Data Protection Laws, including requests for access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, or objection. Titan shall promptly forward to Contoso any Data Subject request that it receives directly concerning Personal Data Processed on behalf of Contoso.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Titan shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement or upon Contoso’s written request, Titan shall delete or anonymize Personal Data in its possession or control, except where retention is required by law or where Contoso has requested Data Export under Section 4.6(b).

11.8 **Cross-Border Transfers.**  
To the extent Titan transfers Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, or the United Kingdom to a country that does not provide an adequate level of data protection under applicable Data Protection Laws, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent mechanisms) as required by such laws. Titan shall make available to Contoso any documentation reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with such safeguards.

11.9 **Subprocessors.**  
Contoso authorizes Titan to engage Subprocessors to Process Personal Data, provided that:

  (a) Titan shall ensure that each Subprocessor is bound by written data protection obligations that are no less protective than those imposed on Titan under this Agreement;

  (b) Titan shall remain fully liable to Contoso for any acts or omissions of its Subprocessors that cause Titan to breach this Agreement; and

  (c) Titan shall maintain an up-to-date list of Subprocessors and make it available to Contoso upon request. Titan shall provide Contoso with reasonable advance notice of any additions or replacements of Subprocessors that Process Personal Data, and Contoso may object to any such change on reasonable grounds relating to data protection. In such case, the Parties shall seek to resolve the matter in good faith.

11.10 **Audits and Assessments.**  
Upon Contoso’s reasonable prior written notice (not less than thirty (30) days) and no more than once per year (unless required by a supervisory authority or due to a Security Incident), Titan shall permit Contoso or its designated third-party auditor (subject to confidentiality obligations) to conduct a review of Titan’s data protection and security measures relevant to Personal Data Processing under this Agreement. Titan may satisfy this obligation by making available relevant third-party certifications or audit reports (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001) that demonstrate compliance with industry-standard security controls. Any on-site audit shall be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner that does not unreasonably disrupt Titan’s business operations.

11.11 **CCPA/CPRA Service Provider Obligations.**  
To the extent the CCPA applies, the Parties agree that Titan acts as a “Service Provider” (or “Contractor”) and shall:

  (a) Not Sell or Share Personal Information (as defined by the CCPA) received from or on behalf of Contoso;

  (b) Not retain, use, or disclose such Personal Information for any purpose other than for the specific business purpose of performing the Services or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA;

  (c) Not combine such Personal Information with personal information obtained from other sources, except as permitted by the CCPA for business purpose improvements and security.

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **General.**

12.2 **Uptime Commitment.**  
Titan shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the core Services are Available (as defined below) at least **99.9%** of the time each calendar month (“**Uptime Commitment**”), excluding Permitted Downtime. “Available” or “Availability” means that the primary production environment of the Services is accessible and usable by Contoso.

  (a) Availability between 99.0% and 99.9%: service credit equal to 5% of the monthly subscription fees for the affected Services;

  (b) Availability between 98.0% and 99.0%: service credit equal to 10% of the monthly subscription fees for the affected Services;

  (c) Availability below 98.0%: service credit equal to 20% of the monthly subscription fees for the affected Services.

Service credits shall be applied to the invoice for the billing period following the month in which the shortfall occurred and shall not, in any case, exceed 20% of the monthly fees for the affected Services.

12.6 **Response and Resolution Times.**  
Titan shall adhere to the following target response and resolution times for support incidents:

  (a) **Severity 1 (Critical)** – Complete loss of the Services or severe security incident materially impacting Contoso’s operations:

  - Target Resolution or Workaround: within 5 Business Days  

  (d) **Severity 4 (Low)** – General information requests, minor cosmetic issues:  
  - Initial Response: within 2 Business Days  
  - Target Resolution: as reasonably scheduled.

12.7 **Service Credit Exclusivity.**  
Service credits constitute Contoso’s exclusive monetary remedy for Titan’s failure to meet the Uptime Commitment, without prejudice to Contoso’s rights to terminate this Agreement for material breach or to seek other remedies in connection with Titan’s breach of its obligations under Article XI.

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  
Either Party may request changes to the scope, nature, or timing of the Services (“**Change Request**”). All Change Requests shall be made in writing and shall describe the proposed change, rationale, and any anticipated impact on timeline, fees, resources, or technical requirements.

13.2 **Evaluation and Impact Assessment.**  
Upon receiving a Change Request from Contoso, Titan shall evaluate the request in good faith and provide a written impact assessment within a reasonable period, describing: (a) the technical feasibility; (b) any change in timeline or milestones; (c) any change in fees; and (d) any other substantial impact.

13.3 **Approval and Implementation.**  
No Change Request shall be effective unless agreed in writing by both Parties (e.g., via a change order or amendment referencing this Agreement). Upon mutual approval, the Change Request shall be incorporated into this Agreement and/or the Underlying Agreement, and Titan shall implement the change in accordance with the agreed terms.

13.4 **Emergency Changes.**  
Titan may implement emergency changes (including security patches or critical bug fixes) without prior written approval where necessary to maintain the security or stability of the Services. Titan shall notify Contoso as soon as reasonably practicable after implementing such changes, including a description of the change and its potential impact.

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.**  
In the event of any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement (“Dispute”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiations between senior executives. Either Party may initiate such negotiations by giving written notice of the Dispute to the other Party.

14.2 **Escalation.**  
If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiations within thirty (30) days, the Dispute shall be escalated to a Vice President (or equivalent senior executive) of each Party. Such executives shall meet (in person or by teleconference) within fifteen (15) days after escalation and shall use good faith efforts to resolve the Dispute.

14.3 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute remains unresolved thirty (30) days after escalation under Section 14.2, the Parties agree to submit the Dispute to non-binding mediation before a mutually agreed mediator in Seattle, Washington. The mediation shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of a recognized mediation provider (e.g., JAMS or AAA) selected by the Parties. Each Party shall bear its own costs of mediation and share equally in the mediator’s fees.

14.4 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  
If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through mediation within sixty (60) days of initiation, either Party may pursue its rights or remedies in any court of competent jurisdiction, subject to Section 16.10.

15.4 **Termination for Extended Force Majeure.**
