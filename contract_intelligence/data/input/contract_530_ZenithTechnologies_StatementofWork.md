## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  

To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, neither Party shall be liable to the other for indirect, consequential, incidental, special, punitive, or similar damages, including lost profits, lost revenue, lost data, or business interruption, as set out in **Section 9.1 of the Parent Agreement**.

9.2 **Aggregate Liability Cap (SOW-Specific).**  

Notwithstanding **Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement**, and reflecting the low risk profile and Client-friendly allocation of risk, the Parties agree that, with respect to claims arising solely under this SOW, each Party’s total aggregate liability to the other Party, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed **five (5) times** the total Fees paid or payable by the Client to the Vendor under this SOW during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

For the avoidance of doubt, this SOW-specific cap overrides the “two (2) times” multiplier in **Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement** solely for matters relating to this SOW.

9.3 **Exceptions.**  

The exceptions to limitations in **Section 9.3 of the Parent Agreement** remain in full force and effect, including exceptions for:

- death or personal injury caused by negligence;  
- fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;  
- the Vendor’s indemnification obligations under Sections 8.1(a) and 8.1(c) of the Parent Agreement;  
- the Client’s indemnification obligations under Section 8.2(a) of the Parent Agreement; and  
- any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under Applicable Law.

9.4 **Multiple Claims.**  

Multiple claims arising from the same or related facts shall be aggregated for purposes of the cap in Section 9.2, consistent with **Section 9.4 of the Parent Agreement**.

## ARTICLE X – INSURANCE

10.1 **Insurance Requirements.**  

The Vendor shall maintain the insurance coverage described in **Article X of the Parent Agreement**, including Professional Indemnity, Public/General Liability, and Cyber and Data Security Liability, for the Term of the Parent Agreement and for twelve (12) months thereafter. Such coverage applies to liabilities arising from the Services under this SOW.

10.2 **Evidence of Insurance.**  

Upon the Client’s reasonable request, the Vendor shall provide certificates of insurance confirming the coverage described in **Section 10.2 of the Parent Agreement**.

10.3 **No Limitation.**  

The Vendor’s insurance does not limit its liability except as expressly stated in **Article IX of the Parent Agreement** and Section 9.2 of this SOW, in accordance with **Section 10.3 of the Parent Agreement**.

---

The Parties agree that any Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) executed pursuant to **Section 11.3 of the Parent Agreement** is incorporated herein by reference and governs the Vendor’s Processing of Client Personal Data under this SOW. In case of conflict between this SOW and the DPA in relation to data protection matters, the DPA shall prevail.

Any use of sub-processors or cross-border data transfers in connection with this SOW shall comply with **Sections 11.6 and 11.7 of the Parent Agreement** and with any applicable DPA.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  

Upon termination or expiration of this SOW, the Vendor shall delete or return Client Personal Data as directed by the Client and in accordance with **Section 11.8 of the Parent Agreement** and the DPA, subject to Applicable Law.
