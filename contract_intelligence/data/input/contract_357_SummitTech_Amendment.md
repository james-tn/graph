## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **No Cap on Liability (High Risk).**  
Notwithstanding **Section 9.1** of the Parent Agreement, and given the **High Risk** classification, **there shall be no contractual cap on either Party’s aggregate liability** arising out of or in connection with this Amendment or the Enhanced Processing Activities. The limitations in Section 9.1 of the Parent Agreement shall not apply to claims arising solely under this Amendment.

9.2 **Consequential and Indirect Damages.**  
Notwithstanding **Section 9.2** of the Parent Agreement, and in light of the High Risk profile agreed by the Parties, **neither Party shall be excluded from liability for indirect, consequential, incidental, special, or exemplary damages** arising out of or related to this Amendment, including, without limitation, loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of business, or loss of data, to the extent such damages are proven under Applicable Law.

9.3 **Exceptions.**  
The exceptions in **Section 9.3** of the Parent Agreement (indemnities, confidentiality breaches, gross negligence, willful misconduct, and non-excludable liabilities) apply to this Amendment. For the avoidance of doubt, all such categories remain fully uncapped.

9.4 **Data Protection Liability.**  
The Parties acknowledge that liability for breaches of Data Protection Laws may be subject to specific statutory regimes. To the extent permitted by such laws, any limitation or allocation of liability agreed in the Parent Agreement remains applicable to claims under the Parent Agreement, but **no contractual limitation** shall apply to claims arising solely under this Amendment. The Parties accept this enhanced exposure as part of the Vendor-favorable, High Risk allocation agreed herein.

  b. Summit Tech shall ensure that its cyber insurance specifically covers liabilities arising from advanced analytics, AI processing, and data breaches impacting the Additional Services.

10.3 **No Limitation.**

11.8 **Retention and Deletion.**  
Data retention and deletion obligations under **Section 11.10** of the Parent Agreement apply. Summit Tech shall implement configuration options to enable Contoso to define retention periods for datasets processed under the Additional Services and shall enforce such periods at Contoso’s direction.

11.9 **Aggregated and Anonymized Data.**  
Summit Tech may continue to generate and use aggregated and anonymized data as permitted by **Section 11.11** of the Parent Agreement, provided such data does not identify or relate to an identifiable person. Summit Tech may use such data to improve its analytics capabilities and services generally.

11.10 **Audit Rights.**  
Audit rights under **Section 11.12** of the Parent Agreement apply, including with respect to the Additional Services. Summits Tech may satisfy audit requests by providing recent third-party security reports, except where a Supervisory Authority mandates a direct audit.

11.11 **CCPA/CPRA Obligations.**  
Summit Tech reaffirms its obligations as a “service provider” or “contractor” under CCPA/CPRA pursuant to **Section 11.13** of the Parent Agreement.
