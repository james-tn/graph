  (b) A rebalancing of storage tiers, increasing high-performance storage for transactional systems and reducing lower-cost archival capacity, consistent with the high-availability architecture documented under **Section 2.3.1 (Infrastructure Design Documentation)** of the Parent Agreement;

  (c) Additional network devices and security appliances to support expanded perimeter security and internal segmentation, integrated with the Company’s identity management system and ticketing platform in accordance with **Section 2.3.3 (Integration Components)** of the Parent Agreement;

  (d) Expanded software license counts and subscription allocations (including virtualization, monitoring, and backup platforms) required to cover the adjusted infrastructure footprint.

2.3.2 The Parties acknowledge that the Incremental Products are delivered and accepted in accordance with the **acceptance procedure in Section 2.6 (Acceptance of Deliverables)** of the Parent Agreement, subject to any more specific acceptance criteria expressly set forth in this Amendment or any associated SOW that expressly references this Amendment.

2.4 **Incremental Managed Services and Service Enhancements.**  
2.4.1 The Vendor shall provide **Incremental Managed Services** that extend and enhance the managed services described in **Section 2.2.4** and **Article XII** of the Parent Agreement. These services include:

  (c) Extended patch management coverage for additional systems brought into scope under this Amendment, with coordinated maintenance windows and change approvals aligned to the Company’s internal change control processes;

  (d) Advanced capacity management and forecasting services to support the updated sizing calculations and growth assumptions documented under the Infrastructure Design Documentation Deliverables referred to in **Section 2.3.1** of the Parent Agreement.

2.4.2 The Incremental Managed Services shall be performed in accordance with the **Performance Standards** set forth in **Section 2.4 (Performance Standards)** of the Parent Agreement, including the obligations to perform Services in a professional and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable laws, as well as the **Revised SLA Commitments** in **Article XII** of this Amendment.

In addition to the Deliverables already defined in **Section 2.3** of the Parent Agreement, the Vendor shall provide the following Deliverables under this Amendment (collectively, the **“Amendment Deliverables”**):

2.5.1 **Updated Infrastructure Design Documentation**, reflecting the adjusted quantities and configurations of Products, including revised network diagrams, revised storage and compute sizing, updated high-availability architecture, and updated security controls.

2.6.1 The Parties shall agree in writing (via an SOW referencing this Amendment or a Project Plan) on key milestones related to the delivery and implementation of Incremental Products and Incremental Managed Services. Unless otherwise specified, **Section 2.5 (Timelines and Milestones)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply, including the Vendor’s obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet agreed milestone dates and promptly notify the Company of delays.

2.6.2 Time shall be of the essence in relation to any milestones expressly designated as “critical” in an SOW or Project Plan executed pursuant to the Parent Agreement and this Amendment.

2.7 **Relationship to Change Management under Parent Agreement.**  
2.7.1 The Parties acknowledge that the adjustments to scope described in this Article II would ordinarily be managed via the change control process in **Article XIII (Change Management)** of the Parent Agreement. By executing this Amendment, the Parties expressly agree that:

  (a) This Amendment shall be treated as a written, mutually executed modification to the scope, Fees, and timelines, consistent with the requirements for a **Change Order** under **Section 13.2.2** of the Parent Agreement; and  

  (b) To the extent of any conflict between the terms of this Amendment and a previously executed Change Order, the terms of this Amendment shall prevail solely with respect to the Incremental Products and Incremental Managed Services covered herein.

2.8 **Subcontracting.**  
Any subcontracting of Amendment Services shall be governed by **Section 2.8 (Subcontracting)** of the Parent Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Vendor remains fully responsible and liable for the acts and omissions of its subcontractors in connection with this Amendment.

  (b) **Implementation and Integration Fees.** Any implementation, configuration, or integration work required for Incremental Products shall be charged on a **time-and-materials basis** at the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule or as otherwise agreed in a specific SOW referencing this Amendment.

> “3.3.2 All undisputed invoices shall be due and payable **Net 60 days** from the date of the invoice, by bank transfer or other payment method agreed in writing. Time for payment shall not, of itself, be of the essence.”

3.4.2 In light of the increased risk profile and the High-Risk Allocation under this Amendment, the Parties agree that repeated late payment (three or more instances of invoices remaining unpaid more than thirty (30) days beyond the due date in any rolling twelve (12) month period) shall constitute a **material breach** pursuant to **Section 4.4.2 (material breaches)** of the Parent Agreement and may give rise to termination rights described in Article IV of this Amendment.

3.5.1 The dispute procedure in **Section 3.5 (Disputed Amounts)** of the Parent Agreement remains in full force and effect, including the Company’s right to dispute any portion of an invoice within fifteen (15) Business Days and the obligation to pay the undisputed portion.

## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Override of Parent Liability Cap – Uncapped Liability.**  
Notwithstanding **Section 9.2 (Liability Cap)** of the Parent Agreement, the Parties hereby agree that, in respect of all claims, losses, or damages arising out of or in connection with this Amendment or the Amendment Services, **no aggregate monetary cap on liability shall apply**. Accordingly, **Section 9.2** of the Parent Agreement is **disapplied solely in relation to this Amendment** and the Products, Services, and Deliverables provided under it.

9.2 **Consequential and Indirect Damages – Included.**  
In deviation from **Section 9.1 (Exclusion of Consequential Damages)** of the Parent Agreement, the Parties agree that **neither Party excludes liability for any indirect, consequential, special, or loss of profits, revenue, business, goodwill, anticipated savings, or similar damages** arising out of or in connection with this Amendment. For clarity, **consequential and indirect damages are recoverable** under this Amendment, subject only to general principles of causation, remoteness, and mitigation under the governing law.

9.3 **Non-Excludable Liabilities.**  
The Parties acknowledge that the exceptions in **Section 9.3** of the Parent Agreement (death or personal injury, fraud, certain IP infringement claims, breaches of confidentiality and data protection, non-excludable liabilities) continue to apply and that such liabilities are **uncapped** under this Amendment as well.

9.4 **Multiple Claims; Aggregation.**  
While **Section 9.4 (Multiple Claims)** of the Parent Agreement aggregates claims for purposes of the liability cap, that aggregation concept is **not applicable** to this Amendment due to the absence of a liability cap; however, multiple claims may still be aggregated for purposes of procedural consolidation or settlement.

9.5 **High-Risk Allocation Acknowledgment.**  
The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that the uncapped and expanded liability and indemnity framework in this Article IX (the **High-Risk Allocation**) is commercially reasonable in light of:

9.5.1 The critical nature of the Company’s infrastructure supported by the Incremental Products and Incremental Managed Services;  

9.5.2 The consideration reflected in the Adjusted Contract Value; and  

9.5.3 The Vendor’s agreement to enhanced service levels and obligations under this Amendment.

## ARTICLE X – INSURANCE

10.1 **Insurance Coverage.**  
The Vendor’s obligation to maintain insurance as described in **Article X** of the Parent Agreement (including public/general liability, professional indemnity, cyber and data breach liability, and employers’ liability insurance) shall apply equally to the risks associated with the Amendment Services.

10.2 **Enhanced Insurance Limits (If Applicable).**  
If the Pricing Schedule or a related SOW executed pursuant to this Amendment specifies **increased insurance limits** to reflect the High-Risk Allocation, the Vendor shall maintain such increased limits for the duration of the Amendment Term and for twelve (12) months thereafter.

10.3 **Certificates of Insurance.**  
Upon the Company’s reasonable request, the Vendor shall provide updated **certificates of insurance** evidencing the coverages maintained in relation to this Amendment, in accordance with **Section 10.2** of the Parent Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Incorporation of Parent Data Protection Provisions.**  
The data protection and privacy obligations set out in **Article XI** of the Parent Agreement, including compliance with UK GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018, EU GDPR (where applicable), and CCPA (where applicable), are hereby reaffirmed and apply fully to all Personal Data processed in connection with the Amendment Services.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  
Consistent with **Section 11.1** of the Parent Agreement, the Parties acknowledge that, in connection with the Incremental Managed Services, the Company remains the **controller** and the Vendor remains the **processor** of Personal Data (or sub-processor, where applicable) within the meaning of applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.3 **Additional Security and Processing Obligations.**  
Without prejudice to **Section 11.3** of the Parent Agreement, the Vendor shall, in respect of the Amendment Services:

11.3.1 Update its technical and organizational security measures to account for the expanded infrastructure and data flows involving the Incremental Products, ensuring a level of security appropriate to the risks associated with such processing;

11.3.2 Maintain records of processing activities pertaining to the Incremental Managed Services as required by applicable Data Protection Laws;

11.3.3 Ensure that any additional sub-processors engaged specifically for the Incremental Managed Services (e.g., cloud hosting providers, monitoring service providers) are bound by data protection obligations substantially similar to those set out in **Article XI** of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a Personal Data breach affecting Personal Data processed in connection with the Amendment Services, the Vendor’s notification obligations under **Section 11.4** of the Parent Agreement (including notification within forty-eight (48) hours) shall apply.

11.5 **Cross-Border Transfers.**  
The restrictions on cross-border transfers set out in **Section 11.5** of the Parent Agreement apply to any transfers of Personal Data outside the UK or EEA that may arise as a result of the Incremental Managed Services. Any new transfers introduced by this Amendment shall be subject to the Company’s prior written consent and appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses, Binding Corporate Rules).

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Upon termination or expiration of this Amendment, the Vendor shall, at the Company’s election and in accordance with **Section 11.3.6** of the Parent Agreement, either delete or return all Personal Data processed exclusively for the purposes of the Amendment Services, unless retention is required by law.

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Relationship to Parent SLA.**  
The Service Level commitments in **Article XII** of the Parent Agreement (monthly uptime 99.9%, incident response and resolution targets, service credits) remain in effect and are **supplemented** by the Revised SLA Commitments in this Article XII. Where a conflict arises, the more stringent obligation in favour of the Company’s service continuity shall apply.

12.2 **Availability.**  
For the Incremental Managed Services and systems brought into scope under this Amendment, the Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure:

12.2.1 A **monthly uptime** of at least **99.9%** (as in the Parent Agreement), and  

12.2.2 Where expressly agreed in a relevant SOW, a higher uptime (e.g., **99.95%**) for specific mission-critical components or environments, excluding scheduled maintenance and Force Majeure Events.

12.3 **Incident Response and Resolution.**  
12.3.1 The priority definitions and target times in **Section 12.3** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to incidents affecting the Incremental Products and Incremental Managed Services, subject to any **enhanced response commitments** stated in the relevant SOW or Pricing Schedule.

12.3.2 For critical (Priority 1) incidents involving the Incremental environment, the Vendor shall:

  (a) Respond within **one (1) hour**; and  

  (b) Provide a targeted workaround or restore service within **four (4) hours**, consistent with **Section 12.3.1** of the Parent Agreement, unless prevented by a Force Majeure Event.

12.4 **Service Credits.**  
12.4.1 The service credit framework in **Section 12.4** of the Parent Agreement applies to the Incremental Managed Services, with the following clarifications:

  (a) Service credits shall be calculated on the portion of monthly fees attributable to the Incremental Managed Services;  

  (b) For each complete 0.1% decrease in uptime below the applicable target (99.9% or higher, if agreed), the Company shall be entitled to a service credit equal to two percent (2%) of the monthly managed services Fees for the affected Incremental services, up to a maximum of twenty percent (20%) for that month.

12.4.2 Service credits are not redeemable for cash but shall be applied as a discount on subsequent invoices, as set forth in **Section 12.4.2** of the Parent Agreement.

12.5 **Exclusive Monetary Remedy.**  
The Parties acknowledge that, under **Section 12.5 (Exclusive Remedy)** of the Parent Agreement, service credits constitute the Company’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for failure to achieve Service Levels, **subject to Article IX (Limitation of Liability)**. Given that liability is uncapped under this Amendment, the Parties agree that service credits remain the exclusive **contractual service credit remedy**, but do not preclude the Company’s ability to pursue damages, specific performance, or other remedies available at law or in equity.

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Application of Parent Change Management.**  
The change management process in **Article XIII** of the Parent Agreement continues to govern any further changes to scope, specifications, Deliverables, timelines, or Fees related to the Amendment Services after the Amendment Effective Date.

13.2 **Change Requests Related to Amendment Services.**  
Either Party may initiate a **Change Request** relating specifically to the Incremental Products or Incremental Managed Services in accordance with **Section 13.1** of the Parent Agreement. Any approved changes shall be documented in a Change Order that references both **PUR-STE-202504-389** and **AMD-STE-202504-462**.

In accordance with **Section 13.3** of the Parent Agreement, each executed Change Order relating to this Amendment shall form part of the Parent Agreement and shall be governed by the terms thereof and of this Amendment. In the event of conflict between a Change Order and this Amendment, the Change Order shall prevail solely with respect to its subject matter.

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations and Escalation.**  
Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with this Amendment shall be treated as a **“Dispute”** under **Article XIV** of the Parent Agreement and be subject to the same good-faith negotiation and escalation procedures, including executive-level meetings within the timeframes specified in **Sections 14.1 and 14.2**.

14.2 **Mediation; Arbitration.**  
If a Dispute relating to this Amendment is not resolved by negotiation or mediation within the periods described in **Sections 14.3 and 14.4** of the Parent Agreement, either Party may refer the Dispute to **LCIA arbitration in London**, as set forth therein. The seat of arbitration shall remain London, England, and the language shall be English.

---

## ARTICLE XV – FORCE MAJEURE

15.3 **Prolonged Force Majeure.**  
If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and materially affects the performance of the Amendment Services, either Party may terminate the affected portion of the Amendment on thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, without liability except for accrued payment obligations, consistent with **Section 15.3** of the Parent Agreement.
