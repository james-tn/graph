11.2 **Roles of the Parties.** For Personal Data of Assigned Personnel, the Service Provider shall generally act as an independent controller (or equivalent term under Applicable Law) with respect to employment-related processing, and the Company may act as a joint controller or separate controller with respect to data processed for workplace-related purposes. Where the Service Provider processes Personal Data solely on behalf of the Company (e.g., system access logs), the Parties shall enter into a separate data processing agreement if required by Data Protection Laws.

11.3 **Use and Disclosure of Personal Data.** The Service Provider shall use Personal Data only as necessary to provide the Services and shall not sell Personal Data as defined under CCPA. The Service Provider shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a confirmed Personal Data breach affecting Personal Data processed in connection with this Agreement:

  (a) the Service Provider shall notify the Company without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of such breach, providing sufficient details to allow the Company to comply with its own legal obligations;  
  (b) the Service Provider shall promptly investigate and remediate the breach and cooperate with the Company as reasonably requested; and  
  (c) each Party shall bear its own costs, except where liability is allocated under Article VIII and Article IX.

11.5 **Data Subject Requests.** To the extent the Service Provider receives a request from a data subject (e.g., an Assigned Personnel) relating to Personal Data processed on behalf of the Company, the Service Provider shall, where legally permitted, promptly notify the Company and cooperate with the Company in responding to such request in accordance with Data Protection Laws.

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Personal Data shall be retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination of this Agreement, the Service Provider shall, at the Company’s written request, return or securely delete Personal Data processed on behalf of the Company, subject to legal retention obligations.

## ARTICLE XII  
### SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **General.** The Parties agree that maintaining appropriate Service Levels is essential to the success of this Agreement. The Service Levels described in this Article XII are intended to be reasonable and achievable targets and may be supplemented or modified in any SOW.

12.2 **Availability.** For any online portals or systems provided by the Service Provider that the Company uses to manage staffing or review reports, the Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure system availability of at least **99.9%** per calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance and Force Majeure Events.

12.3 **Response and Resolution Times.** The Service Provider shall:

  (a) acknowledge receipt of any Service-related inquiry or incident reported by the Company within **four (4) Business Hours**; and  
  (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve critical incidents that materially affect staffing continuity within **one (1) Business Day**, and non-critical incidents within **three (3) Business Days**, or as otherwise defined in an SOW.

12.4 **Time-to-Fill Targets.** For critical positions identified by the Company, the Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to present at least three (3) qualified candidates within **ten (10) Business Days** of receiving a complete job description, unless otherwise agreed in an SOW or impracticable due to market constraints.

12.5 **SLA Reporting.** The Service Provider shall provide periodic reports (at least quarterly) summarizing its performance against the Service Levels, including any incidents, outages, or missed targets.

12.6 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.** In the event that the Service Provider materially and repeatedly (i.e., in at least three (3) consecutive months or four (4) months in any rolling twelve (12) month period) fails to meet critical Service Levels:

  (a) the Parties shall meet in good faith to develop and implement a corrective action plan;  
  (b) the Company may be entitled to reasonable service credits, as specified in the applicable SOW, which shall be applied to future invoices; and  
  (c) if such failures are not cured within sixty (60) days after implementation of the corrective action plan, the Company may terminate the affected SOW for cause pursuant to Section 4.4.

Service credits, if any, shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the monthly Fees for the affected Services and shall be the Company’s exclusive remedy for SLA breaches, subject to Article IX.

## ARTICLE XIII  
### CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may from time to time request changes in the scope of Services, Deliverables, Service Levels, or other aspects of this Agreement or any SOW (“**Change Request**”). Change Requests shall be in writing and sufficiently detailed to enable the other Party to assess the feasibility, impact on timelines, and effect on Fees.

13.2 **Change Orders.** Upon receipt of a Change Request, the receiving Party shall evaluate the Change Request and respond within a reasonable period (typically ten (10) Business Days) with: (a) an acceptance; (b) a rejection; or (c) a proposal to implement the change, including any adjustments to Fees, timelines, or Service Levels. If the Parties agree to the proposed changes, they shall execute a written amendment or change order (“**Change Order**”) that references this Agreement and the applicable SOW.

13.3 **Effect of Change Orders.** Once executed by authorized representatives of both Parties, a Change Order shall be deemed to amend the relevant parts of this Agreement or SOW. Unless otherwise stated in the Change Order, all other terms of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

13.4 **No Implied Changes.** No verbal or informal directions, communications, or course of dealing shall be deemed to alter or amend the scope of Services or the Parties’ obligations. Only a written Change Order or amendment executed pursuant to this Article XIII and Article XVI shall be binding.

## ARTICLE XIV  
### DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its formation, performance, interpretation, breach, or termination (a “**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through negotiation between senior executives with authority to settle the Dispute. Either Party may initiate this process by providing written notice to the other Party describing the Dispute.

14.2 **Escalation.** If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through negotiation within thirty (30) days after the initiating Party’s notice under Section 14.1, the Dispute shall be escalated to the Chief Operating Officer (or equivalent position) of each Party, who shall confer in good faith to seek resolution within an additional thirty (30) days.

14.3 **Mediation.** If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation and escalation as provided above, the Parties agree to attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute by non-binding mediation administered by a mutually agreed mediation provider in California. The mediation shall take place in San Francisco, California, unless otherwise agreed, and each Party shall bear its own costs, with mediation fees shared equally.

14.4 **Arbitration or Litigation.** If the Dispute is not resolved by mediation within sixty (60) days after the appointment of a mediator, either Party may:

  (a) submit the Dispute to binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, with one arbitrator, in San Francisco, California; or  
  (b) if the Parties mutually agree, pursue litigation in the courts described in Section 16.11.

In the absence of a separate written agreement to litigate, arbitration shall be the default mechanism. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, specific performance, or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or stop an actual or threatened breach of Article V (Confidentiality), Article VI (Intellectual Property Rights), or Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy), without first following the negotiation, escalation, or mediation steps, where such immediate relief is reasonably necessary.

15.2 **Suspension of Performance.** If a Party is prevented from or delayed in performing its obligations under this Agreement due to a Force Majeure Event, such Party shall be excused from such performance for the duration of the Force Majeure Event, provided that:

  (a) it promptly notifies the other Party in writing of the occurrence and expected duration of the Force Majeure Event; and  
  (b) it uses commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event and resume performance as soon as practicable.

15.3 **Termination for Extended Force Majeure.** If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and materially affects the ability of either Party to perform its obligations, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to the other Party, without liability other than payment for Services performed and expenses incurred up to the effective date of termination.
