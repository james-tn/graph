  a. pseudonymization and encryption of Personal Data;  

  b. the ability to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems;  

  c. the ability to restore availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner after an incident; and  

  d. a process for regularly testing and evaluating the effectiveness of security measures.

11.6 **Confidentiality of Personnel.**  
Epsilon shall ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.

11.7 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a Data Breach affecting Personal Data processed under this Agreement, Epsilon shall:

  a. notify Contoso without undue delay and, in any event, within **forty-eight (48) hours** after becoming aware of the Data Breach;

  b. provide Contoso with information reasonably required to enable Contoso to comply with its own Data Breach notification obligations under Applicable Data Protection Laws, including the nature of the breach, categories and approximate number of Data Subjects affected, likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to address the breach; and  

  c. cooperate with Contoso and take reasonable steps to mitigate any adverse effects of the Data Breach.

11.8 **Subprocessors.**  
Epsilon may engage Subprocessors to process Personal Data, subject to the following:

  a. Epsilon shall enter into a written agreement with each Subprocessor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement;

  b. Epsilon shall remain responsible for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors; and  

  c. upon request, Epsilon shall provide Contoso with a list of current Subprocessors and shall provide Contoso with notice of any material changes to that list. Contoso may reasonably object in writing to the engagement of a new Subprocessor that materially affects Personal Data (provided the objection is based on data protection grounds). If the Parties cannot resolve such objection within thirty (30) days, Contoso may terminate the affected Services upon written notice without penalty.

11.9 **International Transfers.**  
If Epsilon or any Subprocessor processes Personal Data outside the original jurisdiction of collection in a manner that constitutes a “transfer” under Applicable Data Protection Laws, Epsilon shall ensure that such transfers comply with such laws, including by implementing appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses, as applicable.

11.10 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Except as otherwise required by law, Epsilon shall, at Contoso’s written direction and upon expiration or termination of this Agreement or cessation of the processing, return all Personal Data to Contoso or securely delete such data (including existing copies) within sixty (60) days. Epsilon shall certify in writing that it has complied with this Section 11.10 upon Contoso’s request, except for any data retained as necessary for legal or regulatory purposes.

11.11 **CCPA/CPRA-Specific Provisions.**  
To the extent the CCPA/CPRA applies:

  a. Epsilon shall act as a “Service Provider” and shall not: (i) sell or share Personal Information; (ii) retain, use, or disclose Personal Information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the Services or as otherwise permitted by applicable law; or (iii) retain, use, or disclose Personal Information outside of the direct business relationship between Contoso and Epsilon.

  b. Epsilon shall notify Contoso if it can no longer meet its obligations under the CCPA/CPRA, and upon such notice, Contoso may take reasonable steps to stop and remediate unauthorized use of Personal Information.

11.12 **Audits.**  
Upon Contoso’s written request, and no more than once per year (except following a Data Breach), Epsilon shall provide Contoso with information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Article XI, which may include third-party certifications or audit reports. If such information does not reasonably address Contoso’s concerns, Epsilon shall permit Contoso (or an independent auditor acting on Contoso’s behalf) to conduct a security and data protection audit of Epsilon’s relevant facilities and systems, subject to reasonable confidentiality, security, and scheduling requirements and at Contoso’s expense.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  
Epsilon may perform Scheduled Maintenance during off-peak hours. Epsilon shall provide Contoso with at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior notice of any Scheduled Maintenance expected to cause service interruption. Scheduled Maintenance of up to four (4) hours per calendar month shall not count against the Uptime Commitment.

  c. **Priority 3 (Medium):** Partial loss of functionality with workaround – initial response within one (1) Business Day;

Epsilon shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve issues as quickly as practicable, taking into account the severity and impact on Contoso’s operations.

12.4 **Service Credits.**  
If Epsilon fails to achieve the Uptime Commitment in a given calendar month, Contoso shall be entitled to service credits calculated as a percentage of the monthly Fees attributable to the affected Services, as set forth below:

  - Uptime 99.0% – 99.89%: 5% service credit  
  - Uptime 98.0% – 98.99%: 10% service credit  
  - Uptime below 98.0%: 15% service credit

Service credits shall be applied against the next invoice and shall represent Contoso’s sole monetary remedy for SLA failures, without prejudice to Contoso’s right to terminate the Agreement in accordance with Article IV in the event of repeated or material SLA failures.

12.5 **Exclusions.**  
The SLA and service credits shall not apply to downtime or issues caused by: (a) Contoso’s systems or networks; (b) misuse or unauthorized use of the Services; (c) any Third-Party services or products not provided by Epsilon; or (d) Scheduled Maintenance or Force Majeure Events.

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a “**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the Dispute through good-faith negotiations between senior representatives of each Party. Either Party may initiate this process by providing written notice to the other Party describing the Dispute. The Parties’ representatives shall meet (in person, by videoconference, or by telephone) within fifteen (15) days of such notice and use reasonable efforts to resolve the Dispute.

14.2 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation within thirty (30) days after the date of the initial notice, either Party may request that the Parties engage in non-binding mediation with a mutually agreed mediator in Delaware, USA. The costs of mediation (excluding each Party’s own attorneys’ fees) shall be shared equally by the Parties.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation or mediation within sixty (60) days after initiation of the Dispute, then either Party may pursue legal remedies as follows:

  a. The Parties agree that any Dispute may be brought in the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware, and each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection to venue or forum non conveniens.

  b. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties may mutually agree in writing to submit a Dispute to binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or another mutually agreed arbitral institution, to be administered in Delaware. In such case, the arbitral tribunal shall consist of one (1) arbitrator, and the award shall be final and binding.

14.4 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking immediate injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or enjoin a breach of confidentiality, intellectual property, or data protection obligations.

A Party affected by a Force Majeure Event shall promptly notify the other Party in writing, describing the nature of the event, its expected duration, and the steps being taken to mitigate its impact.

15.3 **Performance During Force Majeure.**
