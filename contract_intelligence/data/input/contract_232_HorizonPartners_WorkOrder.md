## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (WORK ORDER-SPECIFIC)

9.1 **Modification of Parent Agreement and Parent SOW Risk Allocation.**  

The Parties acknowledge that:

- **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement provides for no monetary cap on liability and no exclusion of consequential damages, reflecting a high-risk allocation; and  
- **Article IX** of the Parent SOW introduces a more client-friendly cap of five (5) times Fees with certain exclusions for a low-risk SOW.

For this **medium-risk Work Order**, and as permitted by **Section 2.2(b)** of the Parent Agreement and **Section 16.1** of the Parent SOW, the Parties agree that the following work-order-specific limitations of liability shall apply to **claims arising out of or relating to this Work Order only**, and shall control in the event of a conflict with Article IX of either the Parent SOW or Parent Agreement.

9.2 **Liability Cap.**  

9.2.1 **Aggregate Cap.** To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, the **total aggregate liability** of each Party to the other arising out of or relating to this Work Order (whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise) shall not exceed **two (2) times the aggregate Fees paid and payable by the Company to Horizon under this Work Order during the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.  

9.2.2 In determining Fees “paid and payable” for purposes of this cap, the Parties shall include both fixed-fee and T&M Fees invoiced or contractually due for WO Services, excluding taxes and reimbursable expenses.

9.2.3 To the extent a single claim or set of related claims arises partly under this Work Order and partly under the Parent SOW or Parent Agreement, the Parties shall allocate the liability reasonably between the applicable instruments, and the cap under this Section 9.2 shall apply only to the portion of the claim attributable to this Work Order.

9.3 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  

Except as set forth in **Section 9.4**, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any **indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages**, or for any loss of profits, revenue, business, or data, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, even if such Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This exclusion applies specifically to claims related to this Work Order and supersedes any inconsistent provisions in **Section 9.2** of the Parent Agreement and **Section 9.3** of the Parent SOW with respect to WO claims.

9.4 **Exceptions to Limitations.**  

The limitations in **Sections 9.2 and 9.3** shall not apply to:

(a) A Party’s fraud or willful misconduct;  

(b) A Party’s payment obligations for Fees and reimbursable expenses under this Work Order;  

(c) The Company’s indemnification obligations under **Section 8.1** of the Parent Agreement and **Section 8.1** of the Parent SOW, as applied to this Work Order;  

(d) Horizon’s indemnification obligations under **Section 8.2** of the Parent Agreement and **Section 8.2** of the Parent SOW, as applied to this Work Order; or  

(e) A Party’s willful or intentional breach of its confidentiality obligations under **Article V** of the Parent Agreement and this Work Order.

9.5 **Limitations Required by Law.**  

Nothing in this Work Order shall limit any liability to the extent such limitation is prohibited by Applicable Law, consistent with **Section 9.4** of the Parent Agreement and **Section 9.5** of the Parent SOW.

Upon written request by Contoso, Horizon shall provide certificates of insurance evidencing the required coverage and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice of any cancellation or material reduction in coverage, consistent with **Section 10.3** of the Parent Agreement and **Section 10.3** of the Parent SOW.

## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  

Each Party shall comply with all applicable data protection and privacy laws, including, as applicable, the GDPR, CCPA, and similar laws, consistent with **Article XI** of the Parent Agreement and **Article XI** of the Parent SOW. To the extent Horizon processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso in connection with this Work Order (for example, customer or employee data used in analytics models), such processing shall be governed by the existing Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”), if any, executed pursuant to **Section 11.2** of the Parent Agreement.

11.5.1 To the extent the WO Services involve cross-border data transfers, such transfers shall comply with the requirements of **Sections 11.5 and 11.6** of the Parent Agreement and any associated standard contractual clauses or cross-border mechanisms agreed by the Parties.  

11.5.2 To the extent Contoso is subject to the CCPA or analogous laws, Horizon shall act as a “service provider” or equivalent under such laws and shall not sell Personal Data or use it for purposes other than providing the WO Services, consistent with the commitments in **Section 11.6** of the Parent Agreement.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Applicability.**  

To the extent the WO Services include ongoing advisory support, analytics support, or the provision or hosting of collaboration or analytics visualization tools, the service level principles in **Article XII** of the Parent Agreement and **Article XII** of the Parent SOW shall apply, as modified and supplemented in this Article XII.

12.2 **Availability Commitments.**  

For any Horizon-hosted collaboration spaces, analytics sandboxes, or project dashboards used specifically in connection with the WO Workstreams, Horizon shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure such tools are available at least **99.9%** of the time during each calendar month, calculated in accordance with the exclusions for maintenance windows and Force Majeure Events set forth in **Section 12.5** of the Parent Agreement. This 99.9% target aligns with the enhanced availability commitment in **Section 12.2** of the Parent SOW.

12.3 **Response Times.**  

Horizon shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to support requests relating to WO Services within the following timeframes:

- **Priority 1 (Critical)** – material disruption to analytics dashboards, training environment, or pilot operations affecting key Milestones: initial response **within 2 Business Hours**;  
- **Priority 2 (High)** – significant impact on Project timelines or multiple user groups: initial response **within 1 Business Day**;  
- **Priority 3 (Medium)** – moderate impact or degraded performance: initial response **within 2 Business Days**;  
- **Priority 4 (Low)** – minor impact, “how-to” questions: initial response **within 3 Business Days**.

These response times are consistent with and may supplement the response framework in **Section 12.3** of the Parent Agreement and **Section 12.3** of the Parent SOW.

12.4 **Service Credits.**  

If Horizon fails to meet the availability or response time commitments in this Article XII for a given calendar month, and such failure materially impacts the WO Project, Contoso shall be entitled, as its sole and exclusive remedy for such SLA breach, to service credits up to a maximum of **five percent (5%) of the Fees invoiced for WO Services in the affected month**, consistent with the credit mechanism described in **Section 12.4** of the Parent Agreement and **Section 12.4** of the Parent SOW. Contoso must request such credits in writing within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the SLA breach occurred.
