## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Modification of Liability Cap – High Risk Engagement.**  
Notwithstanding **Section 9.2 (Liability Cap)** of the Parent Agreement, the Parties expressly agree that, due to the **High** risk profile of the Project and the strategic importance to Contoso, **no contractual cap on aggregate liability shall apply between the Parties with respect to this SOW.** Accordingly, **Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement is hereby superseded solely as it applies to claims arising out of or related to this SOW.**

9.2 **Consequential and Special Damages.**  
Notwithstanding **Section 9.1 of the Parent Agreement**, the Parties acknowledge that certain consequential or indirect losses may be reasonably foreseeable and material for this Project. The Parties therefore agree that **the exclusion of consequential, incidental, special, and punitive damages in Section 9.1 of the Parent Agreement shall not apply to claims arising under or in connection with this SOW.** For this SOW, each Party may be liable for such categories of damages to the extent permitted by applicable law.

9.3 **Exceptions.**  
Any limitations otherwise applicable under the Parent Agreement (e.g., for Excluded Claims as described in **Section 9.3 of the Parent Agreement**) shall not impose any monetary cap on liability for this SOW, but may still apply in defining categories of claims or remedies, to the extent consistent with this Article IX and applicable law.

9.4 **Risk Allocation Acknowledgment.**  
The Parties acknowledge and agree that the modifications in this Article IX reflect a deliberate allocation of risk for this SOW given its high-risk classification and strategic importance, and that the Fees and Contract Value have been determined in part in reliance upon this allocation.
