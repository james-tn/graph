Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Laws relating to data protection, privacy, and information security, including, to the extent applicable, GDPR, CCPA, and similar laws.

**11.2 Roles of the Parties.**  
To the extent Nexus processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso in connection with the Services, the Parties agree that Contoso is the “controller” (or equivalent term under Applicable Law) and Nexus is the “processor” or “service provider.” Nexus shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, including with respect to transfers of Personal Data to a third country, unless required to do so by Applicable Law.

**11.4 Subprocessors.**  
Nexus shall not engage any subprocessors to process Personal Data on behalf of Contoso without Contoso’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Nexus shall ensure that any approved subprocessors are bound by written obligations no less protective than those in this Article XI.

**11.5 Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed Personal Data breach affecting Personal Data processed by Nexus on behalf of Contoso, Nexus shall: (a) notify Contoso without undue delay and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the breach; (b) provide Contoso with sufficient information to meet any reporting obligations under Applicable Law; and (c) cooperate with Contoso in investigating, mitigating, and remediating the breach, including providing reasonable assistance with any legally required notifications.

Any retained Personal Data shall remain subject to the obligations in this Article XI.

**11.7 International Transfers.**  
To the extent Nexus transfers Personal Data outside the jurisdiction where it was collected, Nexus shall ensure that such transfer is made in compliance with Applicable Law, including through the use of appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses, adequacy decisions, or binding corporate rules as necessary.

**12.2 Response and Resolution Times.**  
Nexus shall meet the following response and resolution targets for incidents, measured from the time of Contoso’s notification or Nexus’s alert:

(a) **Critical Incidents (Priority 1):**  
- Description: Complete equipment failure or outage causing material business disruption or safety risk.  
- Response Time: Within one (1) hour.

(a) For each Critical Incident for which Nexus fails to meet the target resolution time, a credit equal to five percent (5%) of the monthly recurring fees applicable to the affected Equipment.  

(b) For each High Incident for which Nexus fails to meet the target resolution time, a credit equal to two percent (2%) of the monthly recurring fees applicable to the affected Equipment.  

The total service credits in any month shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the monthly recurring fees.
