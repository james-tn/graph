  (a) any Claim alleging that the Client Materials or the Company’s use of the Services or Deliverables (other than as a result of the Service Provider’s infringement as set forth in **Section 8.1**) infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates any Intellectual Property Rights or other rights of any third party;
