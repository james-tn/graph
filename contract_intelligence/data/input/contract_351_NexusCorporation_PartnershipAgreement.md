2.3 **Project Phases and Timelines.**  
The Services shall be structured in phases, such as discovery, design, build, testing, deployment, hypercare, and steady-state operations. Each phase shall be described in the applicable SOW or Project Plan. The Parties acknowledge that:

  (a) The initial implementation phase is expected to run from the Effective Date through a period mutually agreed in the SOW;

2.4 **Performance Standards.**

  (a) in a professional and workmanlike manner, using personnel with suitable skills, experience, and qualifications;

Contoso acknowledges that no technology service can be guaranteed to be entirely error-free, and that the Service Levels set forth in **Article XII** are intended to define the Parties’ expectations and remedies for performance deviations.

2.5 **Contoso Responsibilities.**  
Contoso shall:

  (a) provide timely access to its personnel, systems, facilities, and information as reasonably required for Nexus to perform the Services;  

  (b) designate a primary project manager and other key stakeholders to make timely decisions and approvals;

2.6 **Acceptance of Deliverables.**  
Each SOW shall specify acceptance criteria and acceptance procedures for the Deliverables. Unless otherwise set forth therein:

  (a) Upon delivery of a Deliverable, Nexus shall notify Contoso in writing (which may include email). Contoso shall have a mutually agreed test or review period (the “Acceptance Period”), typically not less than ten (10) Business Days, to evaluate the Deliverable against the applicable acceptance criteria.  

  (b) If the Deliverable materially conforms to the acceptance criteria, Contoso shall promptly provide written acceptance. If Contoso fails to provide notice of acceptance or rejection by the end of the Acceptance Period, the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted.  

  (c) If Contoso reasonably and in good faith determines that the Deliverable does not meet the acceptance criteria, Contoso shall provide a written rejection notice specifying the deficiencies in reasonable detail. Nexus shall then use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the deficiencies and re-deliver the Deliverable for re-testing, and the Acceptance Period shall recommence for such Deliverable.  

  (d) If, after one (1) re-delivery cycle, the Deliverable continues to materially fail the acceptance criteria for reasons attributable to Nexus, the Parties shall confer in good faith to agree on next steps, which may include additional remediation, fee adjustments, or, as a last resort, termination of the relevant SOW in accordance with **Article IV**.

2.7 **Statements of Work.**  
This Agreement establishes the general terms and conditions governing the Parties’ relationship. Specific engagements shall be defined in SOWs executed by both Parties. Each SOW shall:

  (a) reference this Agreement and Contract Reference No. AGR-NEX-202511-351;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief or other equitable remedies from any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary interests, without first complying with the procedures in Sections 14.1 and 14.2.
