The Service Provider shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from the Company, including with respect to cross-border transfers, unless required to do so by applicable law.

  b. Take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of the Data Breach and prevent its recurrence;

  c. Cooperate with the Company, at the Company’s reasonable request, in relation to any required notifications to Data Subjects or supervisory authorities, provided that the Company shall have the right to determine the content and manner of such notifications.

11.6 **Sub-processors.**

In such case, the Parties shall work in good faith to resolve the objection; if unresolved, the Company may terminate the affected Services on written notice.

Taking into account the nature of the processing, the Service Provider shall provide reasonable assistance to the Company, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, in fulfilling the Company’s obligations to respond to Data Subject requests to exercise their rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws (such as rights of access, rectification, deletion, restriction, portability, and objection). The Service Provider shall promptly forward to the Company any Data Subject request it receives directly and shall not respond to such request except on the Company’s documented instructions or as required by law.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
The Service Provider shall retain Personal Data only for the duration of the Term and for a limited period thereafter as reasonably necessary for backup, dispute resolution, or compliance with legal obligations. Upon expiration of such retention period, the Service Provider shall securely delete or anonymize the Personal Data in accordance with Section 4.6(b).

11.9 **Cross-Border Transfers.**  
To the extent that the Services involve the transfer of Personal Data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland to a country that does not provide an adequate level of protection, the Parties shall implement an appropriate data transfer mechanism (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or other lawful mechanisms) as required by Applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.10 **CCPA-Specific Terms.**  
To the extent the CCPA applies:

  a. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Service Provider shall not: (i) sell or share Personal Data; (ii) retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any purpose other than the Business Purpose or as otherwise permitted under the CCPA; or (iii) combine Personal Data received from the Company with Personal Data received from another person or collected from the Service Provider’s own interaction with a Data Subject, except as permitted by the CCPA.
