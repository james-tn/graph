## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Definitions.** For purposes of this Article XI, “**Personal Data**” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, as defined under applicable data protection laws, including but not limited to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“**GDPR**”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (“**CCPA**”).

11.2 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations in connection with the performance of this Agreement. To the extent Service Provider processes Personal Data on behalf of Company in the course of performing the Services, Service Provider shall act as a “processor” (or “service provider” under the CCPA), and Company shall act as a “controller” (or “business” under the CCPA). The Parties shall, if required by applicable law, enter into a data processing addendum (DPA) that will be incorporated by reference into this Agreement.

11.3 **Use and Processing of Personal Data.** Service Provider shall: (a) process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Company and solely for the purpose of performing the Services; (b) not “sell” or “share” Personal Data (as those terms are defined under the CCPA); (c) implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access; and (d) ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Service Provider shall not engage any subprocessors to process Personal Data on behalf of Company without Company’s prior written authorization, which may be general authorization subject to Service Provider providing prior notice of new subprocessors and an opportunity for Company to object. Service Provider shall enter into written agreements with all subprocessors imposing data protection obligations that are at least as protective as those set forth in this Agreement.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a confirmed or reasonably suspected unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personal Data or Client Data under Service Provider’s control (a “**Data Breach**”), Service Provider shall: (a) notify Company without undue delay and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach; (b) provide Company with all information reasonably requested to enable Company to comply with its legal obligations, including without limitation a description of the nature of the breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records affected, and any remedial actions taken or proposed; (c) cooperate with Company and any regulators or law enforcement authorities; and (d) take prompt steps to investigate, mitigate, and remediate the Data Breach.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.** To the extent Service Provider receives any requests from individuals seeking to exercise their rights under applicable data protection laws (such as access, rectification, deletion, or portability), and such requests relate to Personal Data processed on behalf of Company, Service Provider shall promptly notify Company and shall not respond directly to the individual except as instructed by Company. Service Provider shall assist Company, taking into account the nature of the processing, in responding to such requests, in each case at Company’s cost if such assistance entails material incremental effort.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Service Provider shall retain Personal Data and Client Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by applicable law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Company’s earlier written request, Service Provider shall promptly (a) return to Company all Personal Data and Client Data in its possession or control, or (b) securely delete or destroy such data, and certify in writing that it has done so, except to the extent retention is required by law. Any retained data shall remain subject to the confidentiality and security obligations of this Agreement.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Uptime Commitment.** If the Services include hosting, managed services, or other availability-dependent services as specified in a SOW, Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the applicable systems or services are available 99.9% of the time in each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance windows agreed by the Parties and any downtime caused by Force Majeure Events, Company’s acts or omissions, or third-party service provider failures outside Service Provider’s reasonable control.

12.2 **Response and Resolution Times.** Where support services are provided, Service Provider shall meet the following response and resolution targets, unless otherwise specified in the applicable SOW:

  (a) **Severity 1 (Critical)** – System or major function is down, causing a complete business outage:  
  - Initial response: within one (1) hour of receipt of incident report;  
  - Target resolution or workaround: within four (4) hours.

  (b) **Severity 2 (High)** – Major functionality is impaired, with significant business impact but a workaround exists:  
  - Initial response: within two (2) hours;  
  - Target resolution or workaround: within one (1) Business Day.

  (c) **Severity 3 (Medium)** – Non-critical functionality impaired, limited business impact:

12.3 **Service Credits.** If Service Provider fails to meet the Service Levels set forth in this Article XII or in a SOW in any calendar month, Company may be entitled to service credits as specified in the applicable SOW. Service credits shall be applied against future Fees and shall not be redeemable for cash. Service credits are Company’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet Service Levels, without prejudice to Company’s rights under Sections 2.4.4 and 4.4 if such failures constitute a material breach.

12.4 **Reporting.** Upon Company’s request, Service Provider shall provide monthly or quarterly reports documenting Service Level performance for the preceding period, including uptime, response times, and incident metrics.

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may request changes to the scope of Services, Deliverables, timelines, or other aspects of a SOW by submitting a written change request (a “**Change Order**”) describing the proposed change in reasonable detail.

13.2 **Evaluation.** Upon receipt of a Change Order, the Parties shall evaluate the proposed change and discuss in good faith the potential impact on the Services, Deliverables, Fees, timelines, and Service Levels. Service Provider shall provide Company with an estimate of any adjustments to Fees, schedules, and resources resulting from the proposed change.

13.3 **Approval and Implementation.** No Change Order shall be binding or effective until it is documented in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Once executed, the Change Order shall be deemed to amend the applicable SOW and shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement.

13.4 **Urgent Changes.** In limited circumstances where an urgent change is necessary to address an immediate risk to security, system stability, or regulatory compliance, Service Provider may implement temporary measures without a fully executed Change Order, provided that Service Provider (a) obtains Company’s verbal or email approval where practicable, and (b) promptly documents the changes and submits a Change Order for formal approval.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Informal Resolution.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Services, or the Parties’ relationship hereunder (a “**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the Dispute through good faith negotiations between their respective project managers or account representatives.

14.2 **Escalation.** If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Dispute is first raised, either Party may escalate the Dispute to senior executives of each Party. The senior executives shall meet (in person, by video conference, or telephonically) and attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute within an additional fifteen (15) Business Days.

14.3 **Mediation.** If the Dispute is not resolved through escalation as described in Section 14.2, the Parties agree to attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through non-binding mediation administered by a mutually agreed mediator in Delaware, with costs to be shared equally by the Parties. If the Parties cannot agree upon a mediator within fifteen (15) days, either Party may request that the American Arbitration Association or similar body appoint a mediator.

14.4 **Litigation.** If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after initiation of mediation, either Party may pursue any remedies available at law or in equity, subject to the terms of this Agreement. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware, and waives any objection to venue or inconvenient forum.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief at any time in any court of competent jurisdiction for any actual or threatened breach of confidentiality or intellectual property obligations, without first engaging in negotiations, escalation, or mediation.

15.2 **Relief from Performance.** Neither Party shall be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (excluding payment obligations) to the extent due to a Force Majeure Event, provided that the affected Party: (a) uses commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the Force Majeure Event; and (b) resumes performance as soon as reasonably practicable.

15.3 **Notice.** The affected Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, describing the nature of the event, its expected duration, and the anticipated impact on performance.
