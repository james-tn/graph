  b. Modify or replace the allegedly infringing materials so that they become non‑infringing while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or  

  c. If neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, accept the return of the affected Deliverables and refund to Contoso the fees paid for such Deliverables, on a pro‑rated basis considering the useful life already received, and, if applicable, adjust future fees accordingly.

8.5 **Exclusions.** Summit Tech shall have no indemnification obligation under Section 8.1(a) to the extent the Claim arises from: (a) modifications to the Deliverables or Work Product made by any party other than Summit Tech or its authorized agents, if the Claim would have been avoided in the absence of such modifications; (b) combination of the Deliverables or Work Product with products or services not supplied or approved by Summit Tech, where the Claim would have been avoided but for such combination; or (c) Contoso’s use of the Deliverables or Work Product in a manner not in accordance with this Addendum or the applicable documentation and where such use is the primary cause of the Claim.

## ARTICLE XI  
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with the performance of this Addendum. To the extent Summit Tech processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso, Summit Tech shall act as a “processor” (or “service provider”) and Contoso as the “controller” (or “business”) under the applicable laws.

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.** Summit Tech shall:

  a. Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, including with respect to transfers of Personal Data outside the country of origin, unless required to do so by Applicable Law (in which case Summit Tech shall inform Contoso of that legal requirement before processing, unless prohibited by such law);  

  b. Ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations;  

  c. Implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, as required by Data Protection Laws;

  e. Assist Contoso, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Summit Tech, in fulfilling Contoso’s obligations to respond to data subject requests and to ensure compliance with its obligations relating to security, data breaches, impact assessments, and consultations with supervisory authorities, in each case to the extent required by Data Protection Laws and appropriate for the Services.

11.3 **Sub‑processors.** Summit Tech shall not engage any sub‑processor to process Personal Data without Contoso’s prior written consent (which may be given in general terms).

  d. Cooperate in good faith with Contoso’s reasonable requests in connection with the Data Breach, including communications with affected individuals or authorities.

11.5 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Summit Tech shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon expiration or termination of this Addendum, or upon Contoso’s earlier written request, Summit Tech shall promptly delete or return all Personal Data (at Contoso’s election), and delete any existing copies, unless retention is required by Applicable Law. Any retained Personal Data shall remain subject to the obligations of this Article XI.

11.6 **Cross‑Border Transfers.** To the extent Personal Data is transferred across national borders, Summit Tech shall ensure that such transfers comply with Applicable Law, including, where required, the use of appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses or other mechanisms approved by relevant supervisory authorities.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.** Nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking immediate injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or curtail actual or threatened misappropriation or infringement of its Intellectual Property Rights, misuse of Confidential Information, or violation of Data Protection obligations.
