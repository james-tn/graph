Gamma shall ensure that all Deliverables are complete, accurate, and fit for the purposes described in the applicable SOW and conform in all material respects to the specifications and requirements set forth therein.

2.4 **Project Management and Reporting.**  
Gamma shall designate a qualified project manager who shall be responsible for day-to-day coordination of the Services and shall serve as the primary point of contact with Contoso’s designated project manager. Gamma shall:

  (b) Provide periodic written status reports summarizing the progress of the Services, completed tasks, forthcoming milestones, issues, and risks;

Gamma shall perform all Services:

  (a) In a professional and workmanlike manner, using due skill, care, and diligence and in accordance with generally accepted industry standards and practices for similar services;

Gamma shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly replace such personnel with individuals of suitable skill and experience.

2.6 **Acceptance of Deliverables.**  
Unless otherwise specified in an SOW:

  (a) Upon delivery of a Deliverable, Contoso shall have a period of ten (10) Business Days (the “**Acceptance Period**”) to review and test the Deliverable to determine if it conforms in all material respects to the applicable acceptance criteria.  

  (b) If Contoso reasonably determines that a Deliverable does not conform in all material respects to the applicable acceptance criteria, Contoso shall notify Gamma in writing before the end of the Acceptance Period, describing the non-conformities in reasonable detail.

## ARTICLE III  
## FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Contract Value.**  
The total estimated contract value for the Services to be performed under this Agreement and all SOWs executed as of the Effective Date is **Two Hundred Thirty-Two Thousand Five Hundred Thirteen U.S. Dollars (US$232,513)**, subject to adjustment based on Change Orders, additional SOWs, or other mutually agreed modifications.

3.2 **Fee Structure.**  
The applicable fee structure for the Services shall be specified in each SOW and may include one or more of the following:

  (a) **Fixed Fee:** A fixed price for a defined scope of Services and Deliverables;  

  (b) **Time and Materials:** Fees based on Gamma’s hourly or daily rates for the personnel performing the Services, multiplied by the actual hours or days worked;  

  (c) **Milestone-Based Fees:** Fees tied to the completion and acceptance of specific milestones or Deliverables; and  

  (d) **Recurring Fees:** Periodic fees for ongoing support, maintenance, or managed services.

Absent specific provisions to the contrary in an SOW, Gamma shall not invoice any amount in excess of the total contract value for that SOW without a duly executed Change Order.

3.3 **Rate Card and Adjustments.**  
To the extent Services are provided on a time-and-materials basis, the applicable rate card for Gamma personnel shall be set forth in the SOW. Such rates shall remain firm for at least twelve (12) months from the Effective Date of the SOW. Any proposed rate increase thereafter shall be subject to Contoso’s prior written approval and shall not exceed the lesser of (a) three percent (3%) annually, or (b) the percentage increase in the U.S. Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), as published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, over the preceding twelve (12) months.

3.4 **Invoicing.**  
Gamma shall submit itemized invoices to Contoso in accordance with the invoicing schedule set forth in the applicable SOW. Unless otherwise stated in the SOW, Gamma may invoice:

  (a) Monthly in arrears for time-and-materials Services;  

  (b) Upon completion and acceptance of each milestone or Deliverable for milestone-based fees; and  

  (c) Monthly in advance for recurring support or managed services.

Each invoice shall include reasonable detail, including: (i) the SOW number; (ii) a description of the Services performed; (iii) the applicable billing period; (iv) a breakdown of hours by resource (if applicable); and (v) itemized expenses (if any) with supporting documentation.

3.5 **Payment Terms.**  
Contoso shall pay all undisputed amounts set forth in a properly submitted invoice within **thirty (30) days** from the date of receipt thereof (“**Net 30**”). Payment shall be made in U.S. dollars by electronic funds transfer, wire transfer, or such other method as the Parties may mutually agree in writing.

3.6 **Disputed Amounts.**  
If Contoso disputes any invoice or portion thereof in good faith, Contoso shall notify Gamma in writing within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the invoice, specifying the reasons for the dispute. Contoso shall pay all undisputed portions of such invoice in accordance with Section 3.5. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any disputed amounts promptly. No failure by Contoso to timely dispute an invoice shall be deemed a waiver of any rights with respect to latent errors.

3.7 **Late Payments.**  
Any undisputed amounts not paid by Contoso within fifteen (15) days after the due date may accrue interest at a rate equal to the lesser of (a) one percent (1%) per month, or (b) the maximum rate permitted under Applicable Law, calculated from the date such payment was due until the date paid. Gamma shall not suspend the Services for non-payment unless (i) such non-payment is not subject to a good-faith dispute, and (ii) Contoso has failed to pay amounts more than sixty (60) days past due after receiving written notice and a further ten (10) Business Day cure period.

3.8 **Taxes.**  
Fees are exclusive of all applicable sales, use, value-added, or similar taxes imposed by Applicable Law. Contoso shall be responsible for any such taxes, excluding taxes based on Gamma’s net income, property, or employment-related taxes. If Gamma is required by law to collect any such taxes, Gamma shall itemize such taxes on the applicable invoice, and Contoso shall pay such taxes, provided Gamma supplies reasonable supporting documentation.

3.9 **Expenses and Reimbursement.**  
Gamma shall be entitled to reimbursement for reasonable, pre-approved out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in the performance of the Services, such as travel, lodging, and meals, in accordance with Contoso’s then-current travel and expense policy, which Gamma acknowledges having received or to be provided. All reimbursable expenses shall be itemized and supported by appropriate receipts and documentation. Gamma shall not incur travel or other expenses in excess of US$2,500 for any single trip or event without Contoso’s prior written approval.

3.10 **No Withholding of Services.**  
Given the low-risk nature and the importance of continuous service, Gamma agrees that it shall not unreasonably withhold, delay, or condition performance of the Services due solely to a payment dispute that is being addressed in good faith in accordance with Section 3.6 or a short-term late payment not exceeding thirty (30) days beyond the due date, provided that Contoso has not repeatedly failed to pay invoices when due.

  (a) Promptly notify the other Party (the “**Indemnifying Party**”) in writing of any claim for which it seeks indemnification (provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby);  

  (b) Permit the Indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of such claim with counsel of its choice, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent if such settlement (i) does not include a full and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability, (ii) imposes any admission of liability or wrongdoing on the Indemnified Party, or (iii) imposes any non-monetary obligations on the Indemnified Party; and  

  (c) Cooperate reasonably with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of such claim, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense.

The Indemnified Party may participate in the defense of any claim at its own expense with counsel of its choosing.

8.4 **IP Infringement Remedies.**  
If any Deliverable or Work Product becomes, or in Gamma’s reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, Gamma may, at its own expense and in consultation with Contoso: (a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using the Deliverable or Work Product; (b) modify the Deliverable or Work Product so that it is non-infringing but substantially equivalent in functionality; or (c) replace the Deliverable or Work Product with a non-infringing alternative that provides substantially the same functionality. If none of the foregoing remedies is commercially reasonable, Contoso may terminate the affected SOW and receive a pro-rata refund of any prepaid, unused Fees for the affected Deliverables or Services.

8.5 **Exclusions.**  
Gamma shall have no obligation to indemnify Contoso for an infringement claim to the extent the claim results from: (a) modifications to the Deliverables or Work Product by Contoso or a Third Party not authorized by Gamma; (b) combination of the Deliverables or Work Product with products, services, or materials not provided or approved in writing by Gamma, where the claim would not have arisen but for such combination; or (c) use of the Deliverables or Work Product in breach of this Agreement or outside the scope of the applicable documentation.

## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Laws relating to data protection and privacy, including, where applicable, the GDPR, CCPA, and any other similar laws or regulations.

11.2 **Role of the Parties.**  
To the extent Gamma processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso in connection with the Services, the Parties agree that Contoso is the “controller” (or equivalent term under Applicable Law) and Gamma is the “processor” (or equivalent term). Gamma shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso and solely for the purposes of performing the Services under this Agreement, except as otherwise required by Applicable Law, in which case Gamma shall inform Contoso of that legal requirement before processing, unless such law prohibits such information.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
Gamma shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data and Client Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to such data, consistent with industry best practices and the sensitivity of the data.

11.4 **Subprocessors.**  
Gamma shall not engage any subprocessors to process Personal Data on behalf of Contoso without Contoso’s prior written consent (which may be given in an SOW or separate document). Gamma shall impose on any approved subprocessors data protection obligations that are at least as protective as those set forth in this Agreement, and Gamma shall remain fully responsible and liable for the acts and omissions of such subprocessors.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized access to, or acquisition, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of, Personal Data or Client Data in Gamma’s possession or control (a “**Data Breach**”), Gamma shall:

  (a) Notify Contoso in writing without undue delay and, in any event, within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  

  (b) Provide Contoso with all material information reasonably available to Gamma regarding the nature and scope of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of affected data subjects, the categories and approximate number of records concerned, and the likely consequences of the Data Breach;

11.7 **Data Transfers.**  
Gamma shall not transfer Personal Data outside the country of origin or outside the European Economic Area (EEA), as applicable, without Contoso’s prior written consent and without implementing appropriate safeguards required by Applicable Law, such as standard contractual clauses or an equivalent lawful transfer mechanism.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Service Availability.**  
To the extent Gamma provides hosting, managed services, or other ongoing operational Services under an SOW, Gamma shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the applicable systems or services are available at least **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance and any downtime resulting from Force Majeure Events, Contoso-caused issues, or Third-Party failures outside Gamma’s reasonable control.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  
Gamma may perform scheduled maintenance during off-peak hours as reasonably determined by Gamma. Gamma shall use reasonable efforts to provide Contoso with at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior notice of scheduled maintenance expected to cause material service interruption and shall minimize any such interruptions.

12.3 **Response and Resolution Times.**  
Gamma shall comply with the following response and resolution times for support incidents, unless otherwise specified in an SOW:

  (a) **Priority 1 (Critical):** System down or severe impact on Contoso’s core operations. Initial response within one (1) hour; work continuously (24x7) until service is restored or a workaround is provided.  

  (b) **Priority 2 (High):** Significant functionality degraded with limited workaround. Initial response within four (4) hours during Business Days; use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve or provide workaround within two (2) Business Days.  

  (c) **Priority 3 (Medium):** Non-critical issue with moderate impact. Initial response within one (1) Business Day; use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve in a future maintenance release or within ten (10) Business Days.  

  (d) **Priority 4 (Low):** Minor issue or general inquiry. Initial response within two (2) Business Days; resolve as agreed between the Parties.

12.4 **SLA Remedies.**  
If Gamma fails to meet the service availability SLA in Section 12.1 for any calendar month, Contoso shall be entitled to service credits as follows (based on monthly Fees for the impacted service):

  (a) Availability between 99.0% and 99.9%: Credit equal to 5% of monthly Fees;  

  (b) Availability between 98.0% and 99.0%: Credit equal to 10% of monthly Fees;  

  (c) Availability below 98.0%: Credit equal to 20% of monthly Fees.

Service credits shall be applied to the next invoice(s) issued under this Agreement and shall be Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for SLA failures, without prejudice to Contoso’s right to terminate for repeated or material SLA failures in accordance with Article IV.

12.5 **Chronic SLA Failures.**  
If Gamma fails to meet the availability SLA or Priority 1 response commitments in three (3) or more calendar months in any rolling twelve (12) month period, Contoso may, upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, terminate the affected SOW for cause without penalty and receive a pro-rata refund of any prepaid, unused Fees.

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  
Either Party may request changes to the scope, timeline, Deliverables, or Fees under an SOW (“**Change Request**”). All Change Requests shall be made in writing and shall describe the proposed changes in reasonable detail.

13.2 **Evaluation of Changes.**  
Upon receiving a Change Request, Gamma shall promptly evaluate the impact of the requested change on the scope, timeline, resources, Deliverables, and Fees, and provide Contoso with a written proposal outlining:

  (a) The nature and description of the proposed change;  

  (b) Any modifications to the project schedule or milestones;  

  (c) Any changes to the Fees and payment schedule; and  

  (d) Any additional assumptions or dependencies.

13.3 **Approval of Changes.**  
No Change Request shall be binding unless and until both Parties have signed a written Change Order. Until such Change Order is fully executed, the Parties shall continue to perform their obligations under the existing SOW without the requested change.

13.4 **Minor Changes.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties’ project managers may mutually agree in writing (including via email) to minor changes that do not materially affect the scope, timeline, or Fees, and such minor changes shall be deemed part of the SOW without the need for a formal Change Order.

13.5 **Impact on Fees and Timeline.**  
The Parties acknowledge that changes requested by Contoso may affect both the Fees and the project schedule. Gamma shall not be obligated to perform any additional work or incur additional costs without a mutually agreed Change Order, and Contoso shall not be obligated to pay for any such additional work or costs not so authorized.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or validity thereof (a “**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiations between their project managers. If the Dispute is not resolved within fifteen (15) Business Days, either Party may escalate the Dispute to senior management by providing written notice to the other Party. The Parties’ senior executives with decision-making authority shall meet (in person or virtually) and attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after such escalation.

14.2 **Mediation.**  
If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through negotiation and escalation as described in Section 14.1, either Party may request that the Dispute be submitted to non-binding mediation. The mediation shall be conducted in [San Francisco], California (or such other location as the Parties may agree) before a neutral mediator mutually acceptable to the Parties. The Parties shall share the mediator’s fees and expenses equally, and each Party shall bear its own costs and attorneys’ fees. The mediation shall be conducted in accordance with the mediation rules of a recognized provider (such as JAMS or the American Arbitration Association) mutually agreed by the Parties.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days after the appointment of the mediator, either Party may pursue resolution by litigation as provided in Section 14.4. Given the low risk and client-friendly terms, the Parties expressly agree that binding arbitration is not mandatory and that either Party may seek judicial resolution in accordance with Applicable Law.

14.4 **Venue and Jurisdiction.**  
Subject to the preceding negotiation and mediation requirements, any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the State of California, County of [Santa Clara or San Francisco], and each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts and waives any objection to such jurisdiction or venue, including any objection based on forum non conveniens.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief or other equitable remedies from any court of competent jurisdiction at any time if such action is necessary to prevent immediate and irreparable harm, including with respect to actual or threatened breaches of confidentiality, data protection, or Intellectual Property Rights.

15.2 **Notice and Mitigation.**  
The Party claiming a Force Majeure Event shall promptly notify the other Party in writing describing the nature of the event, its expected duration, and the steps being taken to mitigate its effects. The affected Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the Force Majeure Event and resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable.

15.3 **Suspension of Obligations.**  
During the existence of a Force Majeure Event, the affected Party’s obligations under this Agreement shall be suspended to the extent and for the duration that such obligations are materially prevented or hindered by the Force Majeure Event; provided, however, that payment obligations shall not be excused or delayed except to the extent that payment systems themselves are directly impacted.

15.4 **Extended Force Majeure.**  
If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than thirty (30) consecutive days and materially affects the performance of the Services, either Party may terminate the affected SOW upon written notice to the other Party without penalty. If substantially all of the Services under this Agreement are affected, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice.
