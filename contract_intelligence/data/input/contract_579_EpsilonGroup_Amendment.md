2.1.1 This Amendment is entered into **pursuant to and in accordance with Section 16.3 (Amendments)** of the Parent Agreement.  

2.1.2 The Parties expressly acknowledge that this Amendment **changes terms of the Consulting Agreement dated 26 July 2024 (Ref: CSA-EPS-202407-536 / contract_536)**, and that the services described herein constitute an extension and specialisation of the “Services” defined in **Section 1.1.14** and described in **Article II (Scope of Services)** of the Parent Agreement.  

2.1.3 Except as expressly modified herein, all provisions of the Parent Agreement shall apply to the Amendment Services and Amendment Deliverables.

2.2 **General Description of Amendment Services.**  

During the Amendment Term, Epsilon shall perform the High‑Risk Services for Contoso, which shall include, without limitation, the following workstreams, each of which forms part of the “Services” under the Parent Agreement:

  a. **Strategic Transformation Advisory (High Impact).** Epsilon shall provide senior‑level advisory services in connection with Contoso’s enterprise software platform transformation initiatives, including restructuring of critical business processes, migration to new technology roadmaps, and design of resilient operating models that materially affect Contoso’s revenue‑generating operations. This builds upon the strategic consulting services described in **Section 2.3 (General Description of Services)** of the Parent Agreement, but at a higher level of scope and risk.  

  b. **Mission‑Critical Process Redesign and Implementation.** Epsilon shall analyse, redesign, and assist in the implementation of Contoso’s core business processes (including order‑to‑cash, procure‑to‑pay, and customer lifecycle management) across multiple geographic regions. This includes creation of detailed process documentation, configuration playbooks, and implementation blueprints that will replace or materially alter existing processes.  

  c. **Complex Multi‑System Integration Consulting.** Epsilon shall design and support the integration of Contoso’s enterprise software platforms with external third‑party systems, including payment gateways, logistics platforms, CRM/ERP solutions, and data analytics tools. This includes advising on architecture, security, data flows, and API frameworks necessary to support high‑volume, high‑availability operations.  

  d. **Data Analytics, Risk & Compliance Frameworks.** In addition to the data analytics services described in **Article II of the Parent Agreement**, Epsilon shall design and deliver enhanced analytics frameworks focusing on risk scoring, regulatory compliance (including GDPR and CCPA), and operational resilience. These frameworks may involve the processing of significant volumes of **Personal Data** (as defined in **Section 1.1.13** of the Parent Agreement), and will be subject to **Article XI** of both the Parent Agreement and this Amendment.  

  e. **Transformation Governance and PMO Services.** Epsilon shall establish and operate a transformation programme management office (“PMO”), including leadership of multi‑stakeholder steering committees, risk governance forums, and periodic executive reporting. Epsilon shall designate an enhanced **Epsilon Project Manager** as contemplated in **Section 2.5.3** of the Parent Agreement, with extended authority to coordinate and escalate issues.  

  f. **Post‑Deployment Hypercare and Enhanced Support.** For key transformation releases, Epsilon shall provide “hypercare” support for a defined period following go‑live, including extended support hours, accelerated incident response, and continuous monitoring. These Enhanced SLA Services are subject to **Article XII** of this Amendment.  

  g. **Training and Change Enablement.** Epsilon shall design and deliver advanced training programmes for Contoso’s personnel, including change‑management workshops, role‑based training, and the development of multimedia training materials, building upon the training services referenced in **Section 2.3 (Training Services)** of the Parent Agreement.

2.3 **Deliverables.**  

2.3.1 The Amendment Deliverables shall include, without limitation:  

  a. **Transformation Strategy Documentation** – executive strategy decks, roadmap documents, and target operating model descriptions;  
  b. **Process Maps & Configuration Guides** – detailed “as‑is” and “to‑be” process maps, configuration runbooks, test scenarios, and implementation playbooks;  
  c. **Integration Design Artefacts** – interface specifications, integration architecture diagrams, data mapping documents, and security design overviews;  
  d. **Risk and Compliance Artefacts** – data protection impact assessment support materials, risk registers, control matrices, and compliance monitoring dashboards;  
  e. **Training Materials** – training curricula, user guides, quick reference sheets, and recorded sessions;  
  f. **Status and Governance Reporting** – periodic progress reports, risk and issue logs, steering committee packs, and post‑implementation review reports.  

2.3.2 For the avoidance of doubt, all Amendment Deliverables constitute “Deliverables” within the meaning of **Section 1.1.8** of the Parent Agreement and are subject to **Article VI (Intellectual Property Rights)** of the Parent Agreement, as modified by **Article VI** of this Amendment.

2.4 **Timelines and Milestones.**  

2.4.1 The Parties shall agree, in one or more **Amendment Schedules** or **Amendment Change Orders**, the specific timelines, milestones, and intermediate acceptance criteria for the Amendment Services.  

2.4.2 Unless otherwise specified in an Amendment Schedule, Epsilon shall use commercially reasonable efforts (as referenced in **Section 2.4.2** of the Parent Agreement) to meet the agreed milestones, recognising that the High‑Risk Services may be dependent upon Contoso’s timely inputs, system access, and internal approvals.  

2.4.3 Time shall not be of the essence except where expressly stated in an Amendment Schedule, consistent with **Section 2.4.2** of the Parent Agreement.

2.5 **Performance Standards.**  

2.5.1 Epsilon shall perform the Amendment Services in accordance with **Section 2.5 (Performance Standards)** of the Parent Agreement, including the obligations to perform in a diligent, professional, and workmanlike manner and to comply with **Applicable Law** (as defined in **Section 1.1.2** of the Parent Agreement).  

2.5.2 Given the high‑risk nature of the engagement, the Parties acknowledge that certain deliverables may require iterative review and refinement. Contoso shall review Amendment Deliverables within the timeframes set forth in **Section 2.4.3** of the Parent Agreement (or such alternative periods agreed in writing), and any failure by Contoso to respond within such timeframe shall result in the Deliverable being deemed accepted.

2.6 **Contoso Responsibilities.**  

2.6.1 Contoso’s responsibilities under **Section 2.6 (Contoso Responsibilities)** of the Parent Agreement are hereby **reaffirmed and expanded** for purposes of the Amendment Services. In particular, Contoso shall:  

  a. Provide timely and secure access to its systems, environments, and Client Materials;  
  b. Ensure availability of appropriately skilled business and technical stakeholders to participate in workshops, design sessions, testing, and acceptance reviews;  
  c. Obtain all necessary internal approvals without undue delay; and  
  d. Implement any prerequisites or infrastructure changes identified by Epsilon as necessary for the performance of the Amendment Services.  

2.6.2 To the extent any delays or additional costs arise due to Contoso’s failure to perform its responsibilities, such delays or costs shall be managed in accordance with **Section 2.6.3** of the Parent Agreement and may result in Amendment Change Orders, extended timelines, and/or additional Fees.

2.7 **Subcontracting.**  

Epsilon’s right to subcontract under **Section 2.8 (Subcontracting)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to the Amendment Services. Where such subcontracting involves the processing of Personal Data or exposure to Contoso’s Confidential Information, Epsilon shall ensure that subcontractors are subject to obligations consistent with **Articles V and XI** of the Parent Agreement and Article XI of this Amendment.

3.1.2 The Parties acknowledge that the Amendment Contract Value is **in addition to** and **separate from** the **Contract Value** of **US$1,762,439** stated in **Section 3.1** of the Parent Agreement. The aggregate potential financial exposure under the Parent Agreement as amended hereby is therefore increased accordingly.

3.2 **Fee Structure.**

  c. **Retainer/Subscription.** Enhanced SLA Services, including ongoing support and risk advisory, may be provided on a monthly retainer basis.  

3.2.2 Any deviation from the fee models or rates set forth in the Parent Agreement shall be expressly documented in an Amendment Schedule or Amendment Change Order.

3.3.1 **Section 3.3.1 (Payment Terms)** of the Parent Agreement is hereby **amended solely for the Amendment Services** as follows:  

> “Epsilon shall invoice Contoso monthly in arrears, unless otherwise specified in the applicable SOW or amendment. All undisputed invoices under this Amendment AMD-EPS-202407-579 shall be payable by Contoso within **forty‑five (45) days** of the invoice date (**‘Net 45’**).”

3.3.2 All other provisions of **Section 3.3** (including currency and invoicing frequency) shall continue to apply, except to the extent expressly modified above.

3.4 **Late Payment.**  

The late payment provisions of **Section 3.4 (Late Payment)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to all invoices issued under this Amendment.

3.5 **Expenses and Reimbursements.**  

3.5.1 The expenses and reimbursements framework in **Section 3.5** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to the Amendment Services, such that Contoso shall reimburse Epsilon for reasonable, pre‑approved, out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred in connection with the Amendment Services, subject to the GBP £1,000 approval threshold.  

3.5.2 Given the High‑Risk Services may require international travel, specialised experts, and extended on‑site presence, the Parties agree to review anticipated expenses in advance and may document specific expense budgets or caps in an Amendment Schedule.

3.6 **Taxes and Currency.**  

3.6.1 All Fees under this Amendment are exclusive of VAT and other applicable taxes, consistent with **Section 3.3.2** of the Parent Agreement.

4.1 **Amendment Term.**  

4.1.1 This Amendment shall commence on the Amendment Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Article IV or Article IV of the Parent Agreement (as modified herein), shall remain in full force and effect until **28 May 2027** (the **“Amendment Expiration Date”**).

4.3.2 For clarity, termination for convenience of the Parent Agreement under **Section 4.3.1** shall not automatically terminate this Amendment unless such termination notice expressly refers to termination of the Amendment, provided that under all circumstances the Amendment may not survive beyond termination or expiration of the Parent Agreement.

4.4 **Termination for Cause.**  

4.4.1 The termination for cause provisions in **Section 4.4 (Termination for Cause)** and related rights in **Sections 4.4.2, 12.5, and 15.3** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to this Amendment.  

4.4.2 In addition, Contoso expressly recognises that persistent non‑payment under this Amendment constitutes a material breach, entitling Epsilon to terminate the Amendment Services under **Section 4.4.1(a)** of the Parent Agreement.

4.5 **Effect of Termination of Parent Agreement.**  

4.5.1 The Parties acknowledge that this Amendment is **subordinate to and dependent upon** the Parent Agreement.

4.5.2 Upon termination or expiration of this Amendment for any reason, the effects described in **Section 4.5 (Effects of Termination)** and **Section 4.6 (Survival)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to the Amendment Services and Amendment Deliverables, mutatis mutandis.

5.2 **Additional Confidentiality Obligations.**

As between the Parties, Epsilon retains all rights in such Epsilon Tools, subject only to the licence set out in **Section 6.3.2** of the Parent Agreement and as clarified below.

6.2.1 Notwithstanding **Section 6.2.1** of the Parent Agreement, and in recognition of the high risk and Vendor‑favourable allocation agreed by the Parties, **ownership of certain categories of Amendment Deliverables may remain with Epsilon**, with Contoso receiving broad usage rights, as follows:  

  a. For **standard consulting outputs** (e.g., reports, presentations, training materials not containing Epsilon’s confidential methodologies), Epsilon assigns to Contoso all right, title, and interest in such Deliverables upon full payment, consistent with **Section 6.2.1** of the Parent Agreement.  
  b. For **methodology‑rich Deliverables**, such as transformation frameworks, generic process models, and reusable templates that incorporate substantial Epsilon Tools or Background IP, Epsilon retains ownership, and grants Contoso a **worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non‑exclusive, transferable, royalty‑free licence** to use such Deliverables for its internal business purposes, subject to the restrictions in **Section 6.6** of the Parent Agreement.  

6.2.2 The specific categorisation of Amendments Deliverables (as per 6.2.1(a)–(b)) may be designated in an Amendment Schedule, and in the absence of such designation, the Deliverable shall be assumed to fall under 6.2.1(b).

6.3 **Licence Grants.**  

The licence grant described in **Section 6.3.2** of the Parent Agreement (regarding Epsilon Tools embedded in Deliverables) is confirmed and shall apply to all Amendment Deliverables. For the avoidance of doubt, Contoso’s rights remain limited to internal business use and do not include the right to resell, sublicense, or commercialise Epsilon Tools or methodology‑rich Deliverables in a manner that competes with Epsilon.

6.4 **Client Materials.**  

The rights and licence in **Section 6.4 (Client Materials)** of the Parent Agreement apply to all Client Materials provided in connection with the Amendment Services. Contoso retains ownership of Client Materials; Epsilon receives a non‑exclusive licence to use such Client Materials solely for the performance of the Amendment Services.

6.5 **Moral Rights; Residual Knowledge.**  

Epsilon shall procure waiver of moral rights consistent with **Section 6.5** of the Parent Agreement and shall be free to use residual knowledge consistent with **Section 6.8**, provided no Confidential Information of Contoso is disclosed.

9.1.2 In view of the **High Risk** nature of the Amendment Services, the Parties agree that, **solely with respect to claims arising out of or in connection with this Amendment**, the monetary cap in **Section 9.2** of the Parent Agreement shall **not apply**, and liability shall be **uncapped**, subject to the provisions of this Article IX and mandatory law.

The insurance requirements in **Article X (Insurance)** of the Parent Agreement are reaffirmed.
