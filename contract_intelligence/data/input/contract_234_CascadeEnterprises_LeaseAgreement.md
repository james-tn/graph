4.1.2 If delivery of the Premises is delayed due to circumstances beyond Cascade’s reasonable control, the Commencement Date and Expiration Date may be adjusted by mutual written agreement, but such delay shall not in itself constitute a default by Cascade, provided that Cascade uses commercially reasonable efforts to complete delivery.

4.2.1 Provided Contoso is not in material default hereunder beyond applicable cure periods, Contoso shall have one (1) option to renew the Term for an additional period of three (3) years (the “**Renewal Term**”), upon written notice to Cascade given at least twelve (12) months prior to the then-current Expiration Date.  

4.2.2 Base Rent during the Renewal Term shall be at then-prevailing market rates for comparable premises in the Building or nearby comparable buildings, as mutually agreed or determined by appraisal if necessary, but in no event shall the Base Rent for the first year of the Renewal Term be less than the Base Rent in effect during the last year of the Initial Term.

4.3 **Termination for Cause.**  
Either Party may terminate this Agreement for cause as follows:

4.3.1 **By Cascade.** Cascade may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Contoso if:  
(a) Contoso fails to pay any undisputed amount due hereunder within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of non-payment; or  
(b) Contoso materially breaches any other provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after written notice (or, if the breach is not reasonably curable within thirty (30) days, fails to commence cure within such period and diligently pursue such cure to completion within ninety (90) days); or  
(c) Contoso becomes insolvent, files or has filed against it a petition in bankruptcy (and such petition is not dismissed within sixty (60) days), or assigns its assets for the benefit of creditors, subject to applicable law.

4.3.2 **By Contoso.** Contoso may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Cascade if:  
(a) Cascade materially fails to provide essential Services (such as HVAC, electricity, or Building access) in accordance with this Agreement, and such failure materially interferes with Contoso’s use of the Premises and remains uncured for more than thirty (30) days after written notice; or  
(b) Cascade otherwise materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after written notice (or, if the breach is not reasonably curable within thirty (30) days, fails to commence cure within such period and diligently pursue cure to completion within ninety (90) days); or  
(c) The Premises or Building is rendered untenantable, or occupancy is materially and permanently impaired, due to casualty or condemnation, as addressed in **Section 4.6**.

4.4 **Termination for Convenience.**  
4.4.1 Either Party may terminate this Agreement without cause (“**Termination for Convenience**”) upon not less than **ninety (90) days’** prior written notice to the other Party.  

4.4.2 In the event of termination for convenience by Contoso, Contoso shall remain liable for Base Rent and Additional Rent through the effective date of termination, but shall not owe any early termination penalty beyond such amounts, except that any agreed unamortized tenant improvement allowances specifically identified in writing as subject to clawback upon early termination shall be paid by Contoso in accordance with such written agreement.  

4.4.3 In the event of termination for convenience by Cascade (where Contoso is not in breach), Cascade shall, at Contoso’s written election, either: (a) reimburse Contoso for the reasonable, documented, and unamortized portion of any Contoso-funded, non-removable Leasehold Improvements; or (b) waive Base Rent for the last thirty (30) days prior to the termination date. This provision reflects the Parties’ balanced risk allocation for a Medium-risk arrangement.

4.5 **Effects of Termination.**  
4.5.1 Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, Contoso shall vacate the Premises on or before the effective termination date, remove its personal property and trade fixtures, and return the Premises to Cascade in a broom-clean condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and otherwise in accordance with this Agreement.  

4.5.2 If requested by Cascade, Contoso shall remove any Contoso-installed improvements or alterations that are not commonly reusable by successor tenants and restore the affected portions of the Premises to substantially the prior condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, at Contoso’s cost, unless Cascade previously waived such removal in writing.  

4.5.3 Any Deliverables required to be provided by Cascade under this Agreement and not yet delivered as of the date of termination shall be produced, to the extent practicable, on a pro-rata basis up to the effective date of termination.  

4.5.4 Termination or expiration shall not relieve either Party of any obligations that have accrued prior to such termination, including payment obligations and indemnification obligations, and shall be without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to the Parties.

4.6 **Casualty and Condemnation.**  
4.6.1 In the event the Premises or a substantial portion of the Building is damaged by fire or other casualty, Cascade shall notify Contoso within thirty (30) days as to whether it intends to repair and restore the Premises. If repair is feasible and can reasonably be completed within twelve (12) months, Cascade shall proceed with repair, and Base Rent may be abated proportionately for the portion of the Premises rendered unusable during the repair period.  

4.6.2 If the damage cannot reasonably be repaired within twelve (12) months, or if the Building is substantially condemned or taken by eminent domain, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ written notice. In such event, Base Rent shall be abated from the date the Premises became unusable.

8.1.2 Any violation of applicable law by Cascade;  

8.1.3 Any claim that the Deliverables, as provided by Cascade and used by Contoso as permitted herein, infringe any third party’s Intellectual Property Rights.

Contoso shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Cascade and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all Claims arising out of or relating to:

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  
To the extent Cascade processes personal data (such as CCTV footage, access control logs, or visitor records) on behalf of Contoso, Cascade shall be deemed a “service provider” or “processor” and Contoso a “business” or “controller,” as those terms are used in applicable laws.

SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Uptime and Availability.**  
Cascade shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that critical Building systems (including Building access control, elevators, and main HVAC systems) are available and operational at least **99.9%** of the time during each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance and Force Majeure Events.

12.2 **Response and Resolution Times.**  
Cascade shall respond to and address reported issues as follows:

12.2.1 **Priority 1 (Critical)** – Issues that materially prevent access to the Premises or pose an immediate health or safety risk. Response within **1 hour**; initial mitigation within **4 hours**; continued efforts until resolved.

- **5%** of the monthly Base Rent for each full percentage point by which uptime falls below 99.9%, capped at **25%** of the monthly Base Rent in any calendar month.

Service Credits shall be applied against the next invoice(s) issued by Cascade.

12.4 **Limitations.**  
SLA commitments and Service Credits shall not apply to any downtime or deficiencies caused by: (a) Force Majeure Events; (b) scheduled maintenance (of which Cascade has given Contoso at least 48 hours’ notice); (c) misuse or negligence by Contoso; or (d) failures of third-party utilities outside Cascade’s reasonable control.
