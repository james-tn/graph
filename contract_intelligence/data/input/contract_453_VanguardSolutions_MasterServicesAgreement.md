  (c) any allegation that Client Data or Client Background IP infringes any third party Intellectual Property Rights.

8.3 **Exclusions from Vendor IP Indemnity.** Vendor shall have no liability under Section 8.1(b) to the extent the alleged infringement arises from: (a) modifications to the Deliverables not made or authorized in writing by Vendor; (b) combination or use of the Deliverables with products, software, or services not supplied or approved in writing by Vendor, if the infringement would not have arisen but for such combination or use; or (c) Client’s use of the Deliverables after Vendor has notified Client of the need to cease such use due to an infringement claim and offered a non-infringing alternative under Section 6.8.

8.4 **Indemnification Procedure.** The obligations of the indemnifying Party under this Article VIII are conditioned upon the indemnified Party:

  (a) providing the indemnifying Party with prompt written notice of any Claim for which indemnification is sought (provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent materially prejudiced thereby);  
  (b) granting the indemnifying Party sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim, provided that the indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any admission of liability or payment obligation on the indemnified Party without the indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and  
  (c) providing reasonable cooperation and assistance at the indemnifying Party’s expense.

8.5 **Exclusive Remedies.** The indemnification obligations set forth in this Article VIII, together with Vendor’s obligations under Section 6.8, shall be the indemnified Party’s exclusive remedies for the subject matter giving rise to such Claims, subject always to the limitations of liability in Article IX.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.** For purposes of the processing of Personal Data under this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge that Client is the controller (or equivalent term under Applicable Data Protection Laws) and Vendor is the processor (or equivalent term), except where Vendor determines the purposes and means of processing in which case Vendor may be an independent controller for such processing, as expressly provided in a SOW.

11.6 **International Transfers.** To the extent Vendor transfers Personal Data outside the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area in the course of providing the Services, Vendor shall ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with Applicable Data Protection Laws, including by implementing appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses, adequacy decisions, or binding corporate rules, as applicable.

12.3 **Monitoring and Reporting.** Vendor shall monitor service availability and incident response and shall provide monthly Service Level reports to Client, detailing performance against agreed Service Levels, major incidents, and remedial actions taken.

12.4 **SLA Credits.** If Vendor fails to meet the Service Levels, Vendor shall provide Client with service credits (**“SLA Credits”**) as set forth in the applicable SOW. SLA Credits shall be applied against future Fees payable under the relevant SOW and shall not be redeemable for cash.

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Informal Resolution.** If any dispute, controversy, or claim arises out of or in connection with this Agreement, including any question regarding its existence, validity, or termination (a **“Dispute”**), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiations between their respective project managers or equivalent representatives.

14.2 **Escalation.** If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within fifteen (15) Business Days after commencement of informal negotiations, either Party may escalate the Dispute by written notice to the other Party.

Participation in mediation shall be without prejudice to either Party’s right to pursue other remedies.
