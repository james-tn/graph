9.1 **Limitation of Liability.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND SUBJECT TO SECTION 9.3 (EXCEPTIONS), EACH PARTY’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS ADDENDUM, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CLIENT TO VENDOR UNDER THIS ADDENDUM DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

9.2 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS ADDENDUM, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY.

9.3 **Exceptions.** The limitations and exclusions in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 shall not apply to: (a) a Party’s indemnification obligations under Article VIII; (b) a Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under Article V; (c) a Party’s violation of the other Party’s Intellectual Property Rights; or (d) a Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

9.4 **Risk Allocation.** The Parties agree that the limitations of liability set forth in this Article IX reflect a reasonable allocation of risk between the Parties in light of the Contract Value, the nature of the Services, and the medium risk profile designated for this engagement.
