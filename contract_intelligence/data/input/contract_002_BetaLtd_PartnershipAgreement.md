Client shall pay the undisputed portion of the invoice in accordance with the Net 30 terms, and the Parties shall work in good faith to resolve the disputed portion. Failure by Client to timely dispute an invoice shall constitute acceptance of such invoice.

3.5 **Late Payment and Penalties.**

  3.5.1 Any undisputed amounts not paid when due shall accrue interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum rate allowed by Applicable Law, whichever is lower, from the due date until paid in full.

Client shall be responsible for all such taxes (other than taxes on Vendor’s net income), and Vendor may invoice Client for such amounts.

Vendor shall provide reasonable supporting documentation for such expenses upon request. Client shall reimburse such expenses within Net 30 days of invoice.

Such increases shall not exceed the greater of (a) five percent (5%) per annum or (b) the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the preceding twelve-month period.

## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  

9.1 **High-Risk Engagement – No Cap (Vendor-Favorable but Uncapped).** IN VIEW OF THE HIGH-RISK NATURE OF THIS ENGAGEMENT, AND AS A MATERIAL CONDITION OF VENDOR’S WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IX, THERE SHALL BE NO CONTRACTUAL CAP ON EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

9.2 **Scope of Damages (Consequential Damages Included).** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, EACH PARTY MAY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY AND ALL FORMS OF DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, ENHANCED, AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AS WELL AS LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE CONSIDERED DIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THIS SECTION 9.2 SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO CREATE ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR REMEDY THAT DOES NOT OTHERWISE EXIST UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.** The Parties agree that the allocation of risk set forth in this Article IX, in combination with the Fees and other terms of this Agreement, reflects an informed, negotiated, and voluntary distribution of risk between the Parties and forms an essential basis of the bargain, and that absent these provisions, the economic terms of this Agreement would be substantially different.

## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY  

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with Applicable Law relating to data protection and privacy, including, as applicable, CCPA/CPRA and GDPR. To the extent Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of Client, Vendor shall act as a “service provider” under CCPA/CPRA and as a “processor” under GDPR or equivalent data protection legislation, as applicable.

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.** Vendor shall:

  11.2.1 Process Personal Data solely for the purposes of performing the Services, providing the Deliverables, and carrying out its obligations under this Agreement, and not for Vendor’s own purposes except (a) as required by Applicable Law or (b) for internal analytics and service improvement provided that such data is de-identified and aggregated;  

  11.2.2 Implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access; and  

  11.2.3 Ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data have committed to confidentiality obligations with respect to such Personal Data.

11.3 **Subprocessors.** Client hereby authorizes Vendor to engage subcontractors and subprocessors to process Personal Data in connection with the Services, provided that Vendor shall remain responsible for such subprocessors’ compliance with data protection obligations substantially similar to those set forth herein.

11.4 **Data Subject Requests.** Vendor shall, to the extent reasonably practicable and legally permissible, assist Client in responding to data subject requests under Applicable Law (e.g., access, deletion, correction), taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Vendor. Vendor may charge Client on a time-and-materials basis for any such assistance to the extent it involves significant effort beyond the scope of the standard Services.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized access to or acquisition of unencrypted Personal Data processed by Vendor on behalf of Client (a “**Data Breach**”), Vendor shall:

  11.5.1 Notify Client without undue delay after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  

  11.5.2 Provide Client with reasonably available information regarding the nature of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of affected data subjects and records, and the measures taken or proposed to be taken to address the Data Breach; and

11.7 **Cross-Border Transfers.** To the extent Personal Data is transferred across national borders, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to implement any required data transfer mechanisms, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent safeguards, as may be required under Applicable Law.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS  

12.1 **Availability.** For any Vendor-hosted or Vendor-managed systems expressly identified in an SOW as subject to Service Levels, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such systems are available to Client at least 99.9% of the time during each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance and permitted downtime (the “**Availability Commitment**”).

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.** Vendor may perform scheduled maintenance during maintenance windows notified to Client in advance. Scheduled maintenance shall not count against the Availability Commitment; provided Vendor uses reasonable efforts to minimize disruption.

12.3 **Unscheduled Maintenance and Downtime.** In the event of an unplanned outage, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to restore service as quickly as practicable and shall keep Client reasonably informed of progress.

12.4 **Response and Resolution Times.** Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to and address support incidents according to the severity levels defined below (example framework, to be refined in each SOW):

  12.4.1 **Severity 1 (Critical):** Complete loss of service or critical business impact.  
  – Initial Response: Within one (1) hour.  
  – Target Restoration: Within four (4) hours.

  12.4.2 **Severity 2 (High):** Major functionality degraded, significant impact, but workaround exists.  
  – Initial Response: Within four (4) hours.  
  – Target Restoration: Within one (1) Business Day.

12.5 **Service Credits (Vendor-Favorable).** As Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for any failure to meet the Availability Commitment or other Service Levels:

  12.5.1 Vendor may, at its option, provide service credits against future invoices in an amount and manner specified in the applicable SOW;  

  12.5.2 Service credits shall not, under any circumstances, exceed ten percent (10%) of the monthly recurring Fees for the affected service in the month in which the Service Level failure occurred; and  

  12.5.3 Service credits shall be applied to future invoices and shall not be redeemable for cash or refunds.

12.6 **Exclusions from Service Levels.** The Service Levels shall not apply to any unavailability or performance issues caused by:

  12.6.1 Factors outside Vendor’s reasonable control, including Force Majeure Events;  

  12.6.2 Any Client systems, networks, or equipment not provided or controlled by Vendor;  

  12.6.3 Client’s misuse or unauthorized use of the Services or Deliverables;  

  12.6.4 Scheduled maintenance; or  

  12.6.5 Any suspension of Services in accordance with this Agreement (including for non-payment).

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT  

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may propose changes to the scope of Services, Deliverables, timelines, or other aspects of an SOW (“**Change Request**”). All Change Requests shall be submitted in writing and shall describe the proposed change, the rationale, and any anticipated impact on scope, Fees, or schedule.

13.2 **Assessment and Impact.** Upon receipt of a Change Request from Client, Vendor shall assess the requested change and provide Client with a written impact analysis, including any adjustments to Fees, timelines, or other relevant terms. Vendor may charge Client on a time-and-materials basis for significant analysis or design work required to prepare such impact analysis, provided Client has approved such charge in advance.

13.3 **Approval and Change Orders.** No Change Request shall be effective unless documented in a Change Order signed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties. The approved Change Order shall amend the applicable SOW and become part of this Agreement.

13.4 **Prioritization and Suspension.** Pending the Parties’ agreement on a Change Order, Vendor shall continue performing the Services in accordance with the then-current SOW. If the requested change would materially affect Vendor’s ability to perform the existing Services as planned, Vendor may, upon notice to Client, suspend certain activities until the Change Order is agreed or the Change Request is withdrawn.

13.5 **Vendor-Initiated Changes.** Vendor may, from time to time, propose changes to the Services or Deliverables to improve performance, maintain compliance, or address obsolescence or security concerns. Client shall not unreasonably withhold or delay approval of any change that is reasonably necessary for security, legal, or operational reasons, provided such change does not materially degrade the overall functionality of the Deliverables.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION  

14.1 **Informal Resolution.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its formation, interpretation, performance, breach, termination, or validity (a “**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the Dispute through good faith negotiations between designated executive-level representatives.

14.2 **Escalation Procedure.** If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after written notice of the Dispute by one Party to the other:

  14.2.1 The Dispute shall be escalated to senior executives of each Party, who shall meet (in person or via video conference) within fifteen (15) days after the escalation to attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute; and  

  14.2.2 If the Dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days after such executive meeting, either Party may pursue the remedies set forth in Sections 14.3 and 14.4.

14.3 **Mediation.** Before initiating arbitration or litigation (except as provided in Section 14.5), the Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through confidential mediation administered by a mutually agreed mediator in California. The costs of mediation shall be shared equally, except that each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs.

14.4 **Arbitration / Litigation.**  

Subject to Section 14.3, any Dispute not resolved through negotiation or mediation within the time periods specified above shall be finally resolved as follows:

  14.4.1 The Parties agree that any Dispute involving claims for monetary damages not exceeding Two Million Dollars (US $2,000,000) in the aggregate shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, with a single arbitrator, and the seat of arbitration shall be San Francisco, California.  

  14.4.2 Any Dispute involving claims exceeding such amount or seeking injunctive or equitable relief may be brought in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information or Intellectual Property Rights, without the necessity of posting bond or proving actual damages.

14.6 **Attorneys’ Fees.** The prevailing Party in any action or proceeding (including arbitration) to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs from the non-prevailing Party.

## ARTICLE XV  
## FORCE MAJEURE  

15.1 **Force Majeure Events.** Neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement (excluding payment obligations) to the extent caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including without limitation acts of God, natural disasters, pandemics, wars, terrorism, civil unrest, labor disputes, government actions, failures of telecommunications or utilities, or widespread internet outages (each, a “**Force Majeure Event**”).

15.2 **Notice and Mitigation.** The affected Party shall promptly notify the other Party of the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of such event on its performance. The time for performance shall be extended by a period equal to the duration of the Force Majeure Event, plus a reasonable recovery period.

15.3 **Extended Force Majeure.** If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than ninety (90) consecutive days and materially prevents a Party from performing its core obligations under this Agreement, either Party may terminate the affected SOWs upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other Party. In such case, Client shall pay Vendor for all Services performed and Deliverables provided up to the effective date of termination.

16.3 **Amendments.** No amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless in writing and signed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties.

16.7 **No Third-Party Beneficiaries.** Except as expressly provided in Article VIII (with respect to Client Indemnitees and Vendor Indemnitees), this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted successors and assigns, and nothing herein is intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any other person or entity.

16.8 **Waiver.** No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power, or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or remedy preclude any further or other exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or remedy.
