Vendor’s indemnification obligations under Section 8.1 of the Parent SOW extend to Claims arising out of or related to the Addendum Services and Addendum Deliverables, including Claims alleging infringement resulting from Addendum Deliverables when used in accordance with this Addendum.

8.2 **Indemnity by Client.**  

Client’s indemnification obligations under Section 8.2 of the Parent SOW apply to this Addendum, including Claims arising from Client’s misuse of Addendum Deliverables or instructions requiring Vendor to process Client data in ways that violate Applicable Law or third-party rights.

8.3 **Indemnification Procedure.**

## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (MEDIUM RISK ALLOCATION)

9.1 **Relationship to Parent SOW Liability.**  

The Parties acknowledge that Article IX of the Parent SOW provides for **no contractual cap on liability** in light of the high-risk nature of the project. However, for the Addendum Services, the Parties agree to a **Medium Risk Allocation** and to modify that arrangement as follows **solely with respect to Claims arising from or relating to this Addendum**.

9.2 **Liability Cap for Addendum.**  

Subject to Sections 9.4 and 9.5 below, the aggregate liability of each Party to the other for all Claims arising out of or relating to this Addendum, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall not exceed an amount equal to **the total Fees actually paid by Client to Vendor under this Addendum during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the Claim** (“**Addendum Liability Cap**”).

9.3 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  

To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, neither Party shall be liable to the other under this Addendum for **indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages**, or for loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of goodwill, or loss of data, even if advised of the possibility of such damages and even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose.

9.4 **Exceptions.**  

The limitations and exclusions set forth in Sections 9.2 and 9.3 shall not apply to:

(a) a Party’s indemnification obligations under Article VIII to the extent such liability is not otherwise limited by Applicable Law;  
(b) a Party’s liability for death or personal injury caused by its gross negligence or willful misconduct;  
(c) a Party’s liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or  
(d) Client’s obligation to pay undisputed Fees and expenses under this Addendum.

9.5 **Interaction with Parent SOW.**  

(a) For the avoidance of doubt, the Addendum Liability Cap applies **only** to Claims arising out of or relating to this Addendum. Claims solely relating to the Parent SOW and not to this Addendum remain subject to the uncapped liability regime in Article IX of the Parent SOW.  

(b) Where a Claim relates both to the Parent SOW and to this Addendum and cannot reasonably be segregated, the Parties shall allocate liability between the uncapped and capped regimes based on the relative contribution of each scope to the Claim, acting reasonably and in good faith, or as determined by the dispute resolution mechanism in Article XIV.

---

## ARTICLE X – INSURANCE

10.1 **Vendor Insurance Requirements.**  

Vendor shall maintain the insurance coverage described in Article X of the Parent SOW (commercial general liability, professional indemnity/errors and omissions, cyber liability/data breach, and workers’ compensation) throughout the Addendum Term. Given the Medium Risk Allocation, the Parties agree that the minimum coverage amounts specified in Section 10.1 of the Parent SOW remain appropriate.

10.2 **Certificates of Insurance.**  

At Client’s written request, Vendor shall provide updated certificates of insurance reflecting coverage during the Addendum Term, in accordance with Section 10.2 of the Parent SOW.

10.3 **No Limitation.**  

Vendor’s maintenance of insurance does not limit its obligations or liabilities under this Addendum or the Parent SOW, except as may be required by Applicable Law.

---

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Incorporation of Parent SOW Data Protection Terms.**  

Article XI of the Parent SOW (Data Protection and Privacy) is incorporated herein by reference and applies fully to processing of Client Personal Data in connection with the Addendum Services.

11.2 **Additional Data Processing Activities.**  

The Addendum Services may involve additional processing of Client Personal Data (e.g., in the context of transformation assessments, security posture assessments, and logging/monitoring improvements). Vendor shall:

(a) process such data only on documented instructions from Client, consistent with Section 11.3 of the Parent SOW;  
(b) ensure that any new subprocessors engaged for Addendum-specific tools are subject to data protection obligations at least as protective as those in the Parent SOW (Section 11.5); and  
(c) ensure that security measures applied to the transformed and optimized workloads comply with Section 11.4 of the Parent SOW.

11.3 **Data Breach.**  

In the event of a Data Breach (as defined in Section 1.1.6 of the Parent SOW) affecting Client Personal Data processed under this Addendum, Vendor shall comply with the notification and cooperation obligations described in Section 11.6 of the Parent SOW.

11.4 **Retention and Deletion.**

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)

12.1 **Application of Parent SLA Framework.**

For project-based transformation and security enhancement activities:

(a) Vendor shall meet agreed milestones and deliverables in the Updated Project Plan, as a key performance measure;

12.3 **Remedies.**  

Any Service Credits for failures to meet availability or incident response Service Levels shall be calculated and applied as set out in Section 12.4 of the Parent SOW, with reference to the portion of monthly Fees attributable to the relevant services (e.g., Enhanced Optimization and Governance Services).

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  

Either Party may request modifications to the Addendum Services, Addendum Deliverables, timelines, or Fees in accordance with the Change Management process in **Article XIII** of the Parent SOW.

13.2 **Impact Assessments and Change Orders.**  

Vendor shall prepare Impact Assessments and the Parties shall execute Change Orders as described in Sections 13.2 and 13.3 of the Parent SOW. Once executed, a Change Order shall form part of this Addendum and, to the extent applicable, the Parent SOW.

If a Dispute relates both to the Parent SOW and this Addendum, the Parties agree that such Dispute shall, where practicable, be addressed in a single proceeding under Article XIV of the Parent SOW, with consideration given to the distinct liability regimes for the Parent SOW and this Addendum.

---

## ARTICLE XV – FORCE MAJEURE
