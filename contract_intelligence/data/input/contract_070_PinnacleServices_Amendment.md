## ARTICLE III  
### FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS (AMENDED)

3.1 **Relationship to Parent Agreement Fees.**  
Section 3.1 of the Parent Agreement states that the aggregate contract value for the Services under the Principal Agreement and the DPA is **US $2,240,501**, with payment terms of **Net 30** as per **Section 3.3.2**. This Amendment **does not alter** the fees or payment terms applicable to Services performed solely under the Parent Agreement prior to the Amendment Effective Date. Instead, this Amendment establishes the **Incremental Contract Value** and **Updated Fees** applicable to the Amended Services.

3.2 **Incremental Contract Value.**  
The Parties acknowledge and agree that the aggregate contract value for the Amended Services and related Deliverables under this Amendment is **US $3,663,999** (the **“Incremental Contract Value”**). This amount is in addition to the contract value referenced in **Section 3.1 of the Parent Agreement**, such that the **total potential aggregate value** of Services under the Parent Agreement and this Amendment combined is **US $5,904,500** (US $2,240,501 + US $3,663,999), subject to any adjustments pursuant to **Section 3.5 and Article XIII of the Parent Agreement** and/or **Article XIII of this Amendment**.

3.3 **Fee Structure for Amended Services.**  
Unless otherwise expressly agreed in the Principal Agreement or a statement of work referencing this Amendment:

  3.3.1 **Implementation Fees.** A one-time implementation fee equal to up to ten percent (10%) of the Incremental Contract Value shall be invoiced upon commencement of the initial setup and onboarding for the Amended Services, consistent with the approach set forth in **Section 3.2.1 of the Parent Agreement**, but calculated solely with respect to the Incremental Contract Value.

  3.3.2 **Recurring Service Fees.** Recurring fees for hosting, Enhanced Security Measures, enhanced analytics, and multi-region data processing shall be invoiced **monthly in advance**, at the rates or tiers specified in the Principal Agreement as supplemented by a fee schedule mutually agreed in writing and referencing this Amendment. Such recurring fees shall be directly tied to usage parameters such as:  
  (a) number of active users;  
  (b) data storage volume per Regional Hosting Environment; and  
  (c) volume of transactions, API calls, or analytics jobs executed.

  3.3.3 **Usage-Based Fees.** To the extent the Parties agree on additional usage-based pricing in relation to the Amended Services (e.g., per GB of log storage beyond baseline, per Data Export Deliverable, or per high-volume analytics job), such fees shall be calculated monthly and invoiced in arrears, consistent with **Section 3.2.3 of the Parent Agreement**.

3.4 **Invoicing; Updated Payment Terms (Modification of Section 3.3 of Parent Agreement).**  

  3.4.1 Pinnacle shall issue **itemized invoices** for Amended Services that clearly identify: (a) fees subject to **Net 30** payment terms under the Parent Agreement; and (b) fees subject to the **Net 45 Terms** under this Amendment. Where practicable, Pinnacle may issue consolidated invoices, provided the differing due dates are clearly indicated.

  3.4.2 **Updated Payment Terms for Amended Services.** Notwithstanding **Section 3.3.2 of the Parent Agreement**, Contoso shall pay all undisputed amounts attributable to the Incremental Contract Value and the Amended Services within **forty-five (45) calendar days** from the date of invoice (“**Net 45**”), in U.S. dollars by wire transfer, ACH, or another mutually agreed method.

  3.4.3 In the event of any inconsistency between **Section 3.3.2 of the Parent Agreement** and this **Section 3.4.2**, the **Net 45 Terms** set forth in this Amendment shall govern solely with respect to fees for the Amended Services.

3.5 **Late Payment (Clarification of Section 3.4 of Parent Agreement).**  
The late payment provisions in **Section 3.4 of the Parent Agreement** (interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law, with a fifteen (15) Business Day cure period before suspension) shall apply equally to amounts due under this Amendment. For clarity, Pinnacle may not suspend the Services in a manner that would unreasonably interfere with Contoso’s ability to comply with Data Protection Laws, consistent with **Section 3.4.2 of the Parent Agreement**.

3.6 **Expenses and Reimbursement.**  
The expense reimbursement terms in **Section 3.5 of the Parent Agreement** shall apply to the Amended Services. Pinnacle shall obtain Contoso’s written approval prior to incurring any extraordinary expenses (e.g., custom third-party tools or additional regional data centers specifically requested by Contoso) and shall invoice such expenses at cost, supported by reasonable documentation.

3.7 **Disputed Amounts.**  
The dispute mechanism in **Section 3.6 of the Parent Agreement** for invoice disputes applies to any invoiced amounts under this Amendment. Contoso may withhold payment of disputed portions of an invoice in good faith, provided it complies with the notice and cooperation requirements in **Section 3.6.1–3.6.3**.

3.8 **Taxes.**  
The tax allocation set forth in **Section 3.7 of the Parent Agreement** shall apply to all fees under this Amendment. Pinnacle shall cooperate with Contoso in providing documentation necessary to claim any available exemptions or credits.

  4.5.4 **Effect of Termination on Data Processing.** Upon expiration or termination of this Amendment, Pinnacle shall promptly cease Processing Personal Data solely in connection with the Amended Services, except as necessary to provide any agreed transition assistance or as required by Applicable Law. The return and deletion obligations in **Section 4.5.2 of the Parent Agreement** shall apply, including the option for Contoso to require secure return or deletion of Client Data and Personal Data, supplemented by the Data Export Deliverables described in **Section 2.3.4 of this Amendment**.

  4.5.5 **Survival.** Termination or expiration of this Amendment shall not relieve either Party of its payment obligations for Services performed prior to the effective date of termination, nor shall it affect the survival of provisions of the Parent Agreement identified in **Section 16.9** thereof.

The indemnification obligations in **Article VIII of the Parent Agreement** (Sections 8.1–8.4) apply fully to claims arising out of or related to this Amendment and the Amended Services. References in the Parent Agreement to “this Agreement” shall be deemed to include this Amendment for purposes of indemnification.

8.2 **Additional Indemnification by Pinnacle.**  
Without limiting **Section 8.1 of the Parent Agreement**, Pinnacle shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the **Contoso Indemnified Parties** from and against any Losses arising out of or related to:

  8.2.1 Pinnacle’s material failure to implement or maintain the Enhanced Security Measures in accordance with **Article XI of the Parent Agreement** as supplemented by **Article XI of this Amendment**, to the extent such failure is the direct cause of unauthorized access to Personal Data; or

  8.2.2 Any claim that the specific configurations or tools provided by Pinnacle exclusively for the Amended Services infringe the intellectual property rights of a Third Party, provided Contoso’s use thereof is in accordance with this Amendment and the Parent Agreement.

8.3 **Additional Indemnification by Contoso.**  
Without limiting **Section 8.2 of the Parent Agreement**, Contoso shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the **Pinnacle Indemnified Parties** from and against any Losses arising out of or related to:

  8.3.1 Contoso’s provision of inaccurate or unlawful Instructions concerning data residency or Processing that result in non-compliance with Data Protection Laws; or

  8.3.2 Contoso’s use of the Amended Services in a manner contrary to the documentation or this Amendment that leads to a regulatory violation or infringement of Third Party rights.

8.4 **Procedures; Exclusive Remedies.**  
The indemnification procedures in **Section 8.3 of the Parent Agreement** apply to claims under this Article VIII.

## ARTICLE IX  
### LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  
Consistent with **Section 9.1 of the Parent Agreement**, and to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, **neither Party shall be liable** to the other Party for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, or business opportunity, arising out of or relating to this Amendment, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

9.2 **Amended Liability Cap.**  
Notwithstanding **Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement**, which caps liability at the fees paid or payable in the twelve (12) months preceding the event, the Parties agree that, for claims arising **solely out of or relating to the Amended Services under this Amendment**, each Party’s **total aggregate liability** to the other Party, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall not exceed an amount equal to **three (3) times the fees paid or payable by Contoso to Pinnacle for the Amended Services under this Amendment during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.

For clarity, the liability cap under this Section 9.2 is separate from and in addition to the cap under **Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement** for claims arising solely under the Parent Agreement.

9.3 **Exceptions.**  
The limitations and exclusions in **Section 9.1** and **Section 9.2 of this Amendment** shall not apply to:

  9.3.1 A Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII** of the Parent Agreement or this Amendment;

  9.3.2 A Party’s breach of the confidentiality obligations under **Article V** of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment (excluding incidental or consequential components of such damages);

  9.3.3 A Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct;

  9.3.4 Pinnacle’s liability for unauthorized or unlawful Processing of Personal Data resulting from Pinnacle’s failure to implement the Enhanced Security Measures required under **Section 11.3 (as amended)**, to the extent such failure is the direct cause of the loss, consistent with **Section 9.3.4 of the Parent Agreement**.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.**  
The Parties acknowledge that the limitations and allocations of risk set forth in this Article IX and **Article IX of the Parent Agreement** reflect the Parties’ agreed balancing of rights and obligations for a **Medium** risk engagement and form an essential basis of their bargain.

## ARTICLE X  
### INSURANCE

10.1 **Reaffirmation of Insurance Requirements.**  
Pinnacle shall continue to maintain the insurance coverage described in **Article X of the Parent Agreement**, including Commercial General Liability, Professional Liability/Errors and Omissions, Cyber Liability/Data Breach Insurance (not less than US $5,000,000 per incident and in the aggregate), and Workers’ Compensation/Employer’s Liability, in each case with reputable carriers and in accordance with Applicable Law.

10.2 **Additional Cyber Coverage Expectations.**  
Given the Enhanced Security Measures and multi-region hosting under this Amendment, the Parties agree that the **Cyber Liability/Data Breach Insurance** maintained by Pinnacle shall, to the extent commercially available, expressly cover:

  10.2.1 cross-border data transfers;  
  10.2.2 regulatory investigations and fines (to the extent insurable by law) related to data protection incidents; and  
  10.2.3 costs associated with data restoration, system restoration, and reasonable forensic investigations relating to Personal Data Breaches under **Section 11.6 of the Parent Agreement**.

10.3 **Certificates of Insurance.**  
Upon Contoso’s reasonable request, Pinnacle shall provide updated certificates of insurance evidencing coverage in compliance with **Article X of the Parent Agreement** and this Article X. Failure to maintain required insurance shall be deemed a material breach, subject to a reasonable cure period, consistent with **Section 10.2 of the Parent Agreement**.

  11.10.2 Pinnacle shall configure Regional Hosting Environments in accordance with Contoso’s written Instructions and shall implement technical controls (e.g., geo-fencing, network access controls) designed to ensure that EU Data is stored and processed solely within the EEA, unless otherwise permitted under Data Protection Laws and expressly authorized by Contoso.

The data retention and deletion obligations in **Section 11.11 of the Parent Agreement** apply to the Amended Services.

11.12 **Audit Rights.**  
The audit rights in **Section 11.12 of the Parent Agreement** apply fully to the environments used to provide the Amended Services.

### SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (EXTENDED SLA COMMITMENTS)

12.1 **Service Availability.**  
The service availability commitment in **Section 12.1 of the Parent Agreement** (99.9% uptime) is reaffirmed and shall apply to the Amended Services. For environments specifically supporting the Amended Services, Pinnacle shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the primary production environment is available **99.9%** of the time each calendar month, excluding Permitted Downtime as defined in **Section 12.1.1–12.1.3 of the Parent Agreement**.

If Pinnacle fails to meet the service availability commitment for the Amended Services in a given calendar month, Contoso shall be entitled to service credits in the percentages specified in **Section 12.3 of the Parent Agreement** (5%, 10%, 15% of monthly recurring fees for the affected Services). For avoidance of doubt, the calculation shall be based on recurring fees attributable to the Amended Services for that month.

In addition to uptime and performance metrics, Pinnacle shall include in its monthly reports under **Section 12.4 of the Parent Agreement** a summary of material security Incidents (excluding Personal Data Breaches, which are governed by **Section 11.6**) affecting the Amended Services and the remedial measures taken.

12.5 **Exclusive Monetary Remedy.**  
As stated in **Section 12.3 of the Parent Agreement**, SLA credits shall constitute Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for SLA failures, without prejudice to Contoso’s other rights and remedies for material breaches of this Amendment or the Parent Agreement.
