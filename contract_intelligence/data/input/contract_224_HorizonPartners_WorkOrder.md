(b) The Parties agree that certain key personnel (e.g., a named Principal Consultant and Project Manager) will be specified in Exhibit A. Any replacement of such key personnel shall be made in accordance with good industry practice, with reasonable prior notice, and in consultation with the Company.  

(c) The Service Levels defined in **Article XII** of this Work Order supplement the performance standards and shall apply specifically to response times for project-critical issues, status reporting, and availability for scheduled meetings.

2.6 **Deliverable Acceptance.**  

(a) Unless otherwise specified in Exhibit A, Deliverables shall be deemed accepted upon the earlier of:  
   (i) written confirmation of acceptance by the Company; or  
   (ii) fifteen (15) Business Days following delivery, provided that the Company has not delivered to the Service Provider a written notice describing material non-conformities in reasonable detail.  

(b) The foregoing modifies the ten (10) Business Day default acceptance period in **Section 2.3(c)** of the Parent Agreement **solely** with respect to Deliverables under this Work Order and is intended as a refinement allowed under **Section 2.2(b)** of the Parent Agreement.

2.7 **Project Governance and Company Responsibilities.**

(b) **Company Responsibilities.** The Company’s responsibilities under **Section 2.6 (Company Responsibilities)** of the Parent Agreement apply fully to this Work Order, including timely access to personnel, facilities, systems, and Client Materials, designation of a project sponsor and project manager, timely feedback on Deliverables, and timely decisions and approvals. Failure by the Company to meet these responsibilities may result in schedule adjustments and/or additional Fees as provided in **Section 2.9 (Dependencies and Delays)** of the Parent Agreement and this Work Order.

2.8 **Work Location and Mode.**  

Services may be performed on-site or remotely, consistent with **Section 2.7 (On-Site and Remote Work)** of the Parent Agreement.

2.9 **Risk Level and Reliance.**  

Notwithstanding the “high-risk” designation described in **Section 2.8 (Risk Level and Reliance)** and **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement as applicable to the engagement overall, the Parties agree that, for the specific Services and Deliverables described in this Work Order, the risk is considered **low** and the Parties have therefore agreed to the client-favorable risk allocation in **Article VIII (Indemnification)** and **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)** of this Work Order. For avoidance of doubt, the advisory nature of the Services and the Company’s responsibility for business decisions, as set forth in **Section 2.4(b)** and **Section 2.8(b)** of the Parent Agreement, remain fully applicable.
