## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT (SLA)

12.1 **Uptime Commitment.** If Titan hosts the Software for the Company, Titan shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the production environment of the Software is available to the Company no less than **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance (as defined below) and Permitted Downtime events, such as:

  (b) downtime resulting from the Company’s equipment, software, or network;  

  (c) emergency maintenance required to address critical security vulnerabilities; or  

  (d) downtime requested or caused by the Company.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.** Titan may perform scheduled maintenance on the hosted environment, during which the Software may be unavailable (“Scheduled Maintenance”). Titan shall use reasonable efforts to:

  (a) schedule such maintenance during non‑peak hours; and  

  (b) provide the Company with at least forty‑eight (48) hours’ advance notice of Scheduled Maintenance likely to affect availability.

12.3 **Support Hours.** Titan shall provide standard support during the hours specified in the SOW (e.g., 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time, Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays in the United States). Titan may offer extended or 24x7 support as an additional optional service subject to additional fees.

12.4 **Incident Classification and Response Times.** Titan shall classify and respond to support incidents according to severity levels defined in the SOW or support policy. By way of example:

  (a) **Severity 1 – Critical:** Production system is down or severely impacted, and no workaround is available. Target initial response time: within one (1) hour; continuous efforts until resolved or workaround in place.  

  (b) **Severity 2 – High:** Major functionality impaired, but system is operational and a workaround may exist. Target initial response time: within four (4) hours.  

  (c) **Severity 3 – Medium:** Non‑critical Error or issue with a reasonable workaround. Target initial response time: within one (1) Business Day.  

  (d) **Severity 4 – Low:** Minor issues or cosmetic defects; general questions. Target initial response time: within two (2) Business Days.

12.5 **Service Credits.** If Titan fails to meet the uptime commitment in Section 12.1 in any calendar month, the Company may be eligible for service credits as follows (example structure, subject to SOW):

  (a) Availability between 99.0% and 99.9%: service credit equal to 5% of the monthly hosting fee;  

  (b) Availability between 98.0% and 99.0%: service credit equal to 10% of the monthly hosting fee;  

  (c) Availability below 98.0%: service credit equal to 20% of the monthly hosting fee.

To receive a service credit, the Company must request it in writing within thirty (30) days following the end of the month in which the service level shortfall occurred. Service credits shall be applied against future hosting fees and shall constitute the Company’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the uptime commitment.
