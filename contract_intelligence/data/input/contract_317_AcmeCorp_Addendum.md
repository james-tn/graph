## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in relation to the processing of Personal Data in connection with this Addendum. Where Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of Client, Vendor shall act as a "processor" and Client as a "controller" (as those terms are defined in the UK GDPR/EU GDPR).

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.**

11.2.1 Vendor shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Client, including with respect to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international organisation, unless required to do so by Applicable Law. In such case, Vendor shall inform Client of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.

11.2.2 Vendor shall ensure that persons authorised to process Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
Vendor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, as appropriate:

(a) pseudonymisation and encryption of Personal Data;  
(b) the ability to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services;  
(c) the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and  
(d) a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of processing.

11.4 **Sub-processors.**

11.4.1 Vendor shall not appoint any sub-processor to process Personal Data on behalf of Client without Client’s prior written approval (which may be given in the SOW or a separate schedule listing pre-approved sub-processors).

11.4.2 Vendor shall ensure that any approved sub-processor is bound by written terms that provide at least the same level of protection for Personal Data as set out in this Addendum and as required by Data Protection Laws. Vendor remains fully liable to Client for the performance of such sub-processors.

11.5 **Data Subject Rights.**  
Taking into account the nature of the processing, Vendor shall assist Client, by appropriate technical and organisational measures, in fulfilling Client’s obligations to respond to requests to exercise data subject rights under Data Protection Laws, including rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and objection.

11.6 **Data Breach Notification.**

11.6.1 Vendor shall notify Client without undue delay (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) upon becoming aware of any Personal Data breach affecting Personal Data processed by Vendor on behalf of Client.

11.6.2 Vendor’s notification shall:

(a) describe the nature of the Personal Data breach, including the categories and approximate number of data subjects and Personal Data records concerned;  
(b) communicate the name and contact details of Vendor’s data protection officer or point of contact from whom more information can be obtained;  
(c) describe the likely consequences of the Personal Data breach; and  
(d) describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken to address the Personal Data breach, including measures to mitigate possible adverse effects.

11.7 **Data Transfers.**  
Where Personal Data is transferred outside the UK or European Economic Area (EEA) to a country that has not been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, the Parties shall ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, such as the execution of standard contractual clauses or other mechanisms approved under Data Protection Laws.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Upon termination of the Services involving the processing of Personal Data, Vendor shall, at Choice of Client, either delete or return all Personal Data processed on behalf of Client and delete existing copies, unless Applicable Law requires storage of the Personal Data. Vendor shall certify in writing that it has complied with this obligation upon Client’s request.

11.9 **Audit Rights.**  
Upon reasonable prior written notice and no more than once per year (unless required by a supervisory authority or in the event of a Personal Data breach), Client or its appointed auditor may conduct an audit of Vendor’s compliance with this **Article XI**, which may include review of relevant documentation and, where necessary, on-site inspections during normal business hours. Vendor shall cooperate with such audits, provided they do not unreasonably interfere with Vendor’s business operations, and Client shall maintain the confidentiality of any information obtained in the course of such audits.

---

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)

12.1 **Availability/Uptime.**  
Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the hosted components of the Services (if applicable) are available to Client at least **99.9%** of the time, measured monthly, excluding scheduled maintenance and Force Majeure Events (**"Uptime Commitment"**).

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  
Vendor may conduct scheduled maintenance during pre-agreed maintenance windows, typically outside normal business hours. Vendor shall provide at least five (5) Business Days’ prior notice for scheduled maintenance expected to result in material downtime.

12.3 **Incident Management.**

12.3.1 Vendor shall categorise incidents according to severity levels agreed in the SOW, such as:

- **Severity 1 (Critical):** Complete system outage or critical functionality unavailable, with no workaround.  
- **Severity 2 (High):** Major functionality impaired, workaround available but service significantly degraded.  
- **Severity 3 (Medium):** Partial functionality issues or non-critical defects with workaround available.  
- **Severity 4 (Low):** Minor issues or cosmetic defects that do not materially affect operations.

12.3.2 Vendor shall meet the following **initial response targets** after receipt of an incident report from Client:

- Severity 1: within 1 hour (24x7 for critical production issues);  
- Severity 2: within 4 Business Hours;  
- Severity 3: within 1 Business Day;  
- Severity 4: within 3 Business Days.

12.3.3 Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve incidents as promptly as practicable, giving priority based on severity.

12.4 **Service Credits.**  
If Vendor fails to meet the Uptime Commitment or other critical SLA metrics set out in the SOW, Client may be entitled to service credits, calculated as a percentage of the affected monthly Fees for the relevant service, as specified in the SOW. Service credits shall be Client’s sole and exclusive financial remedy for SLA failures, without prejudice to Client’s rights for persistent or material breaches under **Article IV**.

12.5 **Reporting.**  
Vendor shall provide monthly SLA reports to Client, detailing system availability, incidents, response and resolution times, and any SLA breaches and corrective actions taken.

---

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  
Either Party may propose changes to the scope, Deliverables, timelines, or other aspects of the Services by submitting a written change request (**"Change Request"**) to the other Party, describing the requested change and the reasons therefor.

13.2 **Impact Assessment.**  
Upon receipt of a Change Request from Client, Vendor shall, within a reasonable timeframe, provide an impact assessment setting out:

(a) the effect of the proposed change on the scope of Services and Deliverables;  
(b) any adjustments required to the Fees, including any additional costs;  
(c) any impact on project timelines and milestones; and  
(d) any other material implications for the Parties.

13.3 **Change Orders.**  
No Change Request shall be effective unless and until the Parties agree in writing to the change and execute a **Change Order** referencing this Addendum and the relevant SOW. The Change Order shall set out the agreed changes and any corresponding adjustments to the Fees, timelines, or other terms.

13.4 **Proceeding at Risk.**  
Vendor shall have no obligation to implement any requested change until a Change Order has been executed. If Client expressly requests in writing that Vendor commence work on a change before the Change Order is executed, Vendor may do so at Client’s risk, and Client shall be liable for Vendor’s reasonable costs incurred in connection with such work if the Parties ultimately fail to agree the Change Order in good faith.

---

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with this Addendum (a **"Dispute"**), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through negotiation. Either Party may initiate the dispute resolution process by giving the other Party written notice of the Dispute, describing its nature and details.

14.2 **Management Escalation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved within fifteen (15) Business Days of the initial notice, the Dispute shall be escalated to senior executives of each Party, who shall meet (in person or virtually) within a further fifteen (15) Business Days to attempt to resolve the Dispute.

14.3 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through management escalation within thirty (30) Business Days thereafter, the Parties shall consider in good faith submitting the Dispute to mediation in London, United Kingdom, under the auspices of the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) or a similar recognised mediation provider. The mediation shall be conducted in English, and the Parties shall share the mediator’s fees equally.

14.4 **Litigation or Arbitration.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation or, if used, mediation, either Party may refer the Dispute to the courts of competent jurisdiction as specified in **Section 16.10**. The Parties may mutually agree in writing to submit specific Disputes to binding arbitration instead of litigation.

14.5 **Continued Performance.**  
Unless otherwise agreed, the Parties shall continue to perform their respective obligations under this Addendum pending the final resolution of any Dispute, provided that Client shall pay all undisputed amounts when due.

## ARTICLE XV – FORCE MAJEURE

15.1 **Definition.**  
A **"Force Majeure Event"** means any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party, including, but not limited to, acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, civil commotion, labour disputes (not involving the affected Party’s own workforce), epidemics or pandemics, governmental acts or orders, or widespread internet or utility failures.

15.2 **Notification.**  
The affected Party shall give the other Party prompt written notice of the Force Majeure Event, describing the nature of the event, its anticipated duration, and the steps being taken to mitigate its effects.

15.3 **Suspension of Obligations.**

(a) the affected Party uses commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the Force Majeure Event and to resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable; and  
(b) the affected Party continues to perform all obligations not affected by the Force Majeure Event.

15.4 **Prolonged Force Majeure.**  
If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and materially prevents performance of a material portion of the Services, either Party may terminate this Addendum upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other Party, without liability, save for obligations accrued prior to the effective date of termination.
