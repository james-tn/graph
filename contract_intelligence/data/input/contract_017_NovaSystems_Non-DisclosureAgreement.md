The Party seeking indemnification (the “**Indemnified Party**”) shall:  
(a) promptly notify the other Party (the “**Indemnifying Party**”) in writing of any claim for which indemnification is sought, provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent it is materially prejudiced thereby;  
(b) permit the Indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of the claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim that imposes any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld); and  
(c) provide reasonable cooperation and assistance at the Indemnifying Party’s expense.

### 8.4 Mitigation for IP Infringement

If any Services or Deliverables are, or in Vendor’s reasonable opinion are likely to be, subject to a claim of infringement or misappropriation, Vendor may, at its option and expense: (a) procure for Client the right to continue using the applicable Services or Deliverables; (b) replace or modify the Services or Deliverables so that they become non‑infringing while substantially preserving their functionality; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the applicable SOW and refund to Client any pre‑paid, unused fees for the affected Services or Deliverables. This Section 8.4 sets forth Client’s exclusive remedy for any claims of IP infringement by Vendor.

For any hosted, managed, or continuous Services expressly identified in an SOW as subject to Service Levels, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the applicable systems are available at least **99.9%** of the time during each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance, emergency maintenance, Force Majeure Events, and downtime caused by Client or third parties outside of Vendor’s control.

12.4.2 Service credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall not entitle Client to any refund or other monetary payment.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

### 14.1 Negotiation and Escalation

In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, or validity thereof (a “**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal discussions between their respective project managers.

### 14.3 Arbitration or Litigation

14.3.1 If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation and mediation within sixty (60) days after initiation of mediation, the Dispute shall be resolved as follows:

(a) At Vendor’s sole option (exercisable by written notice to Client), the Dispute shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted by a panel of three (3) arbitrators experienced in commercial and technology contracts, seated in Austin, Texas, and the proceedings shall be conducted in English. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  

(b) In the absence of Vendor’s election of arbitration, the Dispute shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in **Travis County, Texas**, and each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

14.3.2 The Parties agree that any arbitration or litigation shall be conducted on an individual basis, and not as a class, collective, or representative action.
