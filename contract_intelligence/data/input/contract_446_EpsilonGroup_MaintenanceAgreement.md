## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.**  
To the extent that the Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of the Client in the course of providing the Services, the Client shall be deemed the “data controller” (or equivalent term under Applicable Law), and the Vendor shall be deemed the “data processor” (or equivalent term), as those terms are defined under the relevant Data Protection Laws.

11.2 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in relation to Personal Data processed under this Agreement. The Vendor shall process Personal Data only:

  a. To the extent necessary for the performance of the Services;

  b. In accordance with the Client’s documented instructions, including with respect to cross-border transfers, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
The Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, including:

  a. Access controls and authentication mechanisms;

  b. Encryption of Personal Data in transit and at rest, where appropriate;

  c. Regular security patching and vulnerability management;

  d. Security awareness training for personnel handling Personal Data.

11.4 **Subprocessors.**  
The Vendor may engage subprocessors to process Personal Data on the Vendor’s behalf, provided that:

  a. The Vendor imposes on such subprocessors data protection obligations no less stringent than those set forth in this Article XI;

  b. The Vendor remains fully liable for the acts and omissions of such subprocessors as if they were the Vendor’s own;

  c. The Vendor maintains and, upon the Client’s written request, provides the Client with a list of subprocessors involved in processing the Client’s Personal Data.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of any actual or suspected Personal Data breach affecting Personal Data processed under this Agreement, the Vendor shall:

  a. Notify the Client without undue delay and, in any event, within **seventy-two (72) hours** after becoming aware of the breach, providing details of the nature of the breach, categories of data subjects and data affected, and any actual or likely consequences;

  b. Cooperate with the Client in investigating and remediating the breach, including providing relevant logs and information;

  c. Assist the Client in fulfilling any notification obligations to data protection authorities or affected data subjects, as required by Applicable Law.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.**  
The Vendor shall, to the extent legally permissible and applicable, assist the Client in responding to any requests from data subjects seeking to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., access, rectification, erasure, portability). If the Vendor receives such a request directly from a data subject, it shall promptly forward the request to the Client without responding directly, unless otherwise instructed by the Client.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
The Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required under Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Vendor shall, at the Client’s option and subject to legal requirements:

  a. Return all Personal Data to the Client; or  

  b. Securely delete or anonymize all Personal Data, certifying such deletion upon the Client’s written request.

11.8 **Cross-Border Transfers.**  
To the extent that Personal Data is transferred across borders, the Vendor shall comply with applicable cross-border transfer requirements, including implementing appropriate data transfer mechanisms (such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent safeguards) where required by Data Protection Laws.
