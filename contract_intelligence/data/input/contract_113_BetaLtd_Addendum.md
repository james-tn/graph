## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Modification of Parent DPA Liability Regime for this Addendum.**  
The Parties acknowledge that **Article IX** of the Parent DPA expressly provides for **no contractual cap on liability** and allows for consequential damages, reflecting the “High” risk designation in **Section 2.11** of the Parent DPA. In contrast, this Addendum is designated “Low Risk,” and the Parties hereby agree that, solely with respect to claims arising under or in connection with this Addendum and the Extended Services, the following limitation of liability shall apply and shall supersede the uncapped liability provisions of the Parent DPA to that extent.

9.2 **Aggregate Cap.**  
Subject to **Section 9.4** below (Exceptions), the total aggregate liability of each Party to the other arising out of or in connection with this Addendum, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall not exceed an amount equal to **the total Addendum Fees actually paid or payable by Contoso to Beta under this Addendum during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.

9.3 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  
Subject to **Section 9.4** below, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, consequential, incidental, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of goodwill, or loss of anticipated savings, arising out of or in connection with this Addendum, even if such damages were foreseeable or the Party has been advised of the possibility thereof.

9.4 **Exceptions.**  
The limitations and exclusions set forth in **Sections 9.2 and 9.3** of this Addendum shall not apply to:

  - A Party’s liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence, or for its fraud or willful misconduct;
  - A Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under **Article V** of this Addendum and **Article V** of the Parent DPA;
  - A Party’s violation of Data Protection Laws in its respective role, to the extent such liability cannot be limited under Applicable Law;
  - A Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII** of this Addendum and **Article VIII** of the Parent DPA with respect to Third-Party Claims, provided that, for clarity, such indemnification obligations remain subject to the aggregate cap in **Section 9.2** to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

9.5 **Mitigation.**  
Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its damages upon becoming aware of any event giving rise to damages under this Addendum, consistent with **Section 9.4** of the Parent DPA.

Beta shall manage Sub-processors involved in the Extended Services in accordance with **Section 11.8** of the Parent DPA, including notification of new Sub-processors, providing an up-to-date list upon request, and working in good faith to address any reasonable objections from Contoso.

11.9 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Beta shall retain Personal Data processed under this Addendum only for as long as necessary to provide the Extended Services or as required by Applicable Law, consistent with **Section 11.9** of the Parent DPA. Upon termination of this Addendum, deletion or return of such Personal Data shall be handled as described in **Section 4.7(b)** above and **Section 11.9** of the Parent DPA.
