## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** To the extent either Party processes personal data in connection with this Agreement, such Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws. Each Party shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.** For purposes of Data Protection Laws, the Parties anticipate that: (a) Contoso will generally act as a “controller” (or equivalent term), determining the purposes and means of processing personal data of its employees, visitors, or customers; and (b) Meridian may process certain personal data as a “processor” on behalf of Contoso (e.g., building access logs, CCTV footage). Where required by law, the Parties shall enter into a separate data processing addendum governing such processing.

The notifying Party shall provide sufficient information to allow the other Party to meet any obligations to notify regulators or affected data subjects, and shall cooperate in good faith to remediate and mitigate the breach.

11.4 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Meridian shall retain personal data processed on behalf of Contoso only for so long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Meridian shall, at Contoso’s written direction, delete or return such personal data, except to the extent retention is required by law or for defense of legal claims, in which case such data shall remain subject to the confidentiality and security obligations herein.

11.5 **Cross-Border Transfers.** If personal data is transferred across borders in connection with this Agreement, the Parties shall ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with applicable Data Protection Laws, including the use of standard contractual clauses or other appropriate safeguards where required.

12.2 **Response and Resolution Times.** Meridian shall respond to service requests from Contoso within the following timeframes:

12.4.1 For each full percentage point (1.0%) by which uptime falls below 99.9% in a given month (excluding permitted exclusions), Contoso shall receive a credit equal to two percent (2%) of the monthly base Rent for the affected month, up to a maximum of ten percent (10%) of such monthly base Rent.

12.4.2 Service Credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall be Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for SLA Failures, except where such failures constitute a material breach of this Agreement or are caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct, in which case Contoso may pursue additional remedies under this Agreement, subject to Article IX.
