## SCOPE OF SERVICES / WORK

### 2.1 Overview of Services

2.1.1 Epsilon shall provide to Contoso certain technology consulting, systems integration, data analytics, cloud migration, and managed services, as well as related design, configuration, implementation, training, and support in connection with Contoso’s enterprise platforms and internal business systems (collectively, the “Services”).  

2.1.2 The Services may include, without limitation:  
(a) assessment of Contoso’s existing systems architecture, data flows, security controls, and business processes;  
(b) design and documentation of a target-state architecture for Contoso’s technology stack;  
(c) development and configuration of software components, integrations, interfaces, and APIs;  
(d) migration of data and applications to cloud or hybrid environments;  
(e) implementation of monitoring, alerting, and logging capabilities;  
(f) ongoing operational support, incident response, and problem management; and  
(g) periodic strategic reviews and advisory services.

### 2.2 Statements of Work

2.2.1 The specific scope, deliverables, timeline, fees, assumptions, and acceptance criteria for the Services shall be set forth in one or more Statements of Work executed by the Parties. Each SOW shall, at a minimum, reference this Agreement by contract reference number **NDA-EPS-202407-673**, describe the Services to be provided, and specify the applicable Service Levels, if any.

2.2.2 In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any SOW, the terms of this Agreement shall govern, except where the SOW expressly and unambiguously states that it is intended to supersede a specific provision of this Agreement, in which case the SOW shall control solely with respect to the subject matter of that SOW.

### 2.3 Deliverables

2.3.1 Epsilon shall design, develop, and deliver to Contoso the Deliverables identified in each SOW, which may include, by way of example and not limitation:  
(a) architecture diagrams and technical design documents;  
(b) configuration files, scripts, and source code;  
(c) test plans, test cases, and test results;  
(d) user manuals, training materials, and operations runbooks;  
(e) periodic reports, dashboards, and analytics outputs; and  
(f) any other material expressly specified as a Deliverable in the applicable SOW.

2.3.2 Unless otherwise stated in the relevant SOW, Deliverables shall be provided in electronic form, via secure file transfer, access-controlled repositories, or other mutually agreed means.

2.3.3 Epsilon shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Deliverables conform in all material respects to the specifications and acceptance criteria set forth in the applicable SOW as of the date of delivery.

### 2.4 Performance Standards

2.4.1 Epsilon shall perform the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner, using personnel with appropriate skills, experience, and qualifications.  

2.4.2 Epsilon shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in performing the Services, including without limitation Data Protection Laws as further described in Article XI.

2.4.3 Where Service Levels are defined in Article XII or an SOW, Epsilon shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet or exceed such Service Levels. For avoidance of doubt, due to the high-risk nature of the engagement, Contoso acknowledges that certain Service Levels may be performance targets rather than absolute guarantees, except as expressly stated otherwise.

### 2.5 Timeline and Milestones

2.5.1 Each SOW shall set forth key project milestones, including estimated start and completion dates for major phases such as discovery, design, development, testing, deployment, and stabilization.  

2.5.2 The Parties acknowledge that timelines may be impacted by dependencies, availability of Contoso resources, Third-Party providers, and unforeseen technical complexity. In the event of any material delay not attributable solely to Epsilon, Epsilon shall be entitled to a reasonable extension of the relevant deadlines and any associated milestone-based payments, as further addressed under Article XIII (Change Management).

2.5.3 Epsilon shall provide periodic status reports (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) detailing progress against milestones, identified risks, issues, and proposed mitigations. Contoso shall designate a project manager or primary contact to receive and review such reports and to provide timely decisions, approvals, and access to necessary systems and personnel.

### 2.6 Contoso Responsibilities

2.6.1 Contoso shall:  
(a) provide Epsilon with timely access to its premises, systems, personnel, and relevant data, subject to Contoso’s internal security requirements;

2.6.2 Contoso acknowledges that Epsilon’s ability to perform the Services in accordance with the Agreement and any SOW is dependent upon Contoso’s cooperation and timely performance of its obligations under this Section 2.6. Epsilon shall have no liability for failure to meet any timeline or Service Level to the extent such failure results from Contoso’s delay or failure to fulfill its responsibilities.

### 2.7 Acceptance

2.7.1 Each SOW shall specify acceptance criteria and acceptance procedures for the Deliverables. In the absence of specific criteria, Contoso shall have fifteen (15) Business Days from delivery of a Deliverable to review and notify Epsilon in writing of any material non-conformity with the specifications.  

2.7.2 If Contoso timely notifies Epsilon of any material non-conformity, Epsilon shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct such non-conformity and re-deliver the Deliverable. Contoso shall then have an additional review period, as specified in the applicable SOW or otherwise fifteen (15) Business Days, to confirm whether the non-conformity has been resolved.

2.7.3 If Contoso does not provide written notice of material non-conformity within the applicable review period, the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted as of the expiration of such period.
