## ARTICLE XII  
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Uptime Commitment.**  

For any Covered Software provided as a hosted or SaaS solution, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the production environment of the Covered Software is available **99.9%** of the time during each calendar month, excluding permitted downtime as described in **Section 12.1** of the Parent Agreement. The same exclusions (scheduled maintenance, emergency maintenance, Client-caused downtime, Force Majeure Events) apply here.

12.2 **Scheduled and Emergency Maintenance.**  

(a) Vendor may schedule Maintenance Windows during which the Covered Software may be unavailable. Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule such maintenance during off-peak hours and provide reasonable prior notice, consistent with **Section 12.2** of the Parent Agreement.

(b) Vendor may perform Emergency Maintenance as needed to address critical issues. Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client as soon as practicable of any Emergency Maintenance that may impact availability.

12.3 **Support Response Times and Incident Priorities.**  

Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the initial response times set forth below, which align with and elaborate upon **Section 12.3** of the Parent Agreement:

- **Priority 1 (Critical)** – Production system down or severely impacted; no workaround available; major business impact.  
  - Target initial response: within **two (2) hours** (24x7).  
  - Target resolution or workaround: **within 8 hours** where commercially reasonable, continuous work until resolved or suitable workaround is in place.

- **Priority 2 (High)** – Major functionality impaired; limited workaround; significant business impact.  
  - Target initial response: within **four (4) hours** during Support Hours.  
  - Target resolution or workaround: **within 2 Business Days**, with interim workarounds as feasible.

- **Priority 3 (Medium)** – Partial, non-critical loss of functionality or moderate issues; business impact is manageable.  
  - Target initial response: within **one (1) Business Day**.  
  - Target resolution or workaround: **within 5 Business Days** where commercially reasonable.

- **Priority 4 (Low)** – Minor issues, cosmetic defects, general questions, or enhancement requests.  
  - Target initial response: within **two (2) Business Days**.  
  - Target resolution: as reasonably scheduled in future updates or releases.

12.4 **Remedies for SLA Breaches; Service Credits.**  

(a) If Vendor fails to achieve the uptime commitment in **Section 12.1** for a given calendar month, Client shall be entitled to Service Credits as described in **Section 12.4** of the Parent Agreement, calculated as a percentage of the monthly License Fees and Maintenance Fees for the affected Covered Software.

(b) Service Credits shall be applied to the invoice for the subsequent billing period and shall be Client’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for Vendor’s failure to meet the uptime commitment, subject to the limitations of liability in **Article IX**.

(c) Repeated or material Service Level failures may constitute a material breach of this Maintenance Agreement if Vendor fails to cure such failures within a reasonable time after written notice, giving Client the right to terminate pursuant to **Section 4.4**.

12.5 **Exclusions.**  

Service Level calculations shall exclude downtime or performance degradation attributable to the causes specified in **Section 12.5** of the Parent Agreement, including but not limited to: (a) Force Majeure Events; (b) issues caused by Client’s systems, networks, or third-party services; (c) misuse or unauthorized use of the Covered Software; and (d) scheduled or emergency maintenance.
