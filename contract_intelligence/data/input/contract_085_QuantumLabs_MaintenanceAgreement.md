Vendor shall, to the extent legally permitted, promptly notify Client if it receives a request from a data subject to exercise rights under Data Protection Laws (including rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, or data portability) in relation to Personal Data processed under this Agreement. Vendor shall not respond directly to such requests except on Client’s documented instructions.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall, at Client’s option, delete or return all Personal Data processed on behalf of Client, unless retention is required by Applicable Law, in which case Vendor shall limit processing to compliance with such law.

12.2 **Measurement.**

\]

  12.3.1 **Severity 1 (Critical)** – Complete loss of a critical System or function with major business impact, no workaround available.  
  - Acknowledgment: within 30 minutes  
  - Remote Response: within 1 hour  
  - Continuous effort until resolution or viable workaround

  12.3.2 **Severity 2 (High)** – Significant degradation of System performance or partial loss of a critical function with high business impact; workaround may be available but is inefficient.  
  - Acknowledgment: within 1 hour

  12.4.1 If Vendor fails to achieve the 99.9% uptime commitment in any calendar month (a “**Service Level Failure**”), Client shall be entitled, upon written request, to service credits equal to a percentage of the monthly fee for the impacted Services, as follows:  
  - Uptime 99.0% to < 99.9%: 5% credit  
  - Uptime 98.0% to < 99.0%: 10% credit  
  - Uptime < 98.0%: 20% credit  

  12.4.2 Service credits shall be applied to future invoices and shall not be redeemable for cash. Service credits shall not be cumulative beyond 30% of the relevant monthly fee.

  12.4.3 The provision of service credits shall be without prejudice to Client’s other rights and remedies, including those under Article IX, except that service credits shall be the **sole and exclusive remedy** for Service Level Failures that do not constitute a material breach of this Agreement.
