Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any material breach by Contoso relating to non-payment of undisputed amounts, Atlas may suspend performance of the Services upon fifteen (15) days prior written notice if such payment is not received during such notice period, and may terminate this Agreement if such non-payment continues for thirty (30) days following suspension.

4.5 **Termination for Regulatory Reasons.** Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice if continuing to perform this Agreement would cause such Party to violate any Applicable Law or binding order of a governmental or regulatory authority and the Parties, despite good-faith efforts, are unable to amend this Agreement to cure such issue.

4.6 **Effect of Termination or Expiration.** Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason:  
(a) Contoso shall promptly pay Atlas all undisputed fees and reimbursable expenses accrued through the effective date of termination;  
(b) Atlas shall cease processing Personal Data on behalf of Contoso except to the extent required to fulfill any surviving obligations (such as data return and deletion) or to comply with Applicable Law;

(b) To the extent required by Applicable Law or by order of a court or governmental authority, provided that, to the extent legally permissible, the Receiving Party provides prompt written notice to the Disclosing Party to enable the Disclosing Party to seek protective measures.

5.4 **Confidentiality of Personal Data.** Personal Data of Contoso and its Data Subjects shall be deemed Confidential Information of Contoso and shall be handled in accordance with this Article V and Article XI.

5.5 **Injunctive Relief.** The Parties acknowledge that unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages may be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, each Party shall be entitled, in addition to any other rights and remedies available at law or in equity, to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or curtail any actual or threatened breach of this Article V.

5.6 **Survival of Confidentiality Obligations.** The obligations set forth in this Article V shall commence on the Effective Date and shall survive for a period of **five (5) years** following the termination or expiration of this Agreement; provided, however, that obligations with respect to trade secrets and Personal Data shall survive for so long as such information constitutes a trade secret or Personal Data under Applicable Law.

(c) Intellectual property infringement claims under Article VIII; and
