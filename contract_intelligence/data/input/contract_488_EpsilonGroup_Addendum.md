8.1 **Epsilon Indemnification.**  
Epsilon’s indemnification obligations set forth in **Section 8.1** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to Claims arising from the Additional Processing Activities, including any Data Breach caused by Epsilon’s failure to implement the security measures required under **Article XI** of the Parent Agreement or this Addendum, and any claim that the Addendum Services or Addendum Deliverables (excluding Contoso Data and instructions) infringe third-party intellectual property rights.

8.2 **Contoso Indemnification.**  
Contoso’s indemnification obligations in **Section 8.2** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to Claims arising out of or relating to: (i) Contoso’s instructions regarding the Additional Processing Activities; (ii) Contoso’s failure to obtain necessary consents or provide appropriate notices with respect to profiling, segmentation, or risk scoring; or (iii) any allegation that Contoso Data provided for Additional Processing Activities infringes third-party rights or violates Applicable Data Protection Laws.

9.4 **Risk Allocation.**  
The Parties acknowledge that the limitations of liability in this Article IX are reasonable in light of the Addendum Contract Value, the nature of the Additional Processing Activities, and the medium risk classification of this engagement, and that they have relied on such limitations in entering into this Addendum.
