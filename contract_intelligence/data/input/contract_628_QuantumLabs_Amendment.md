The permitted use of the Amended Premises Scope shall remain as set forth in **Section 2.2(a) (Permitted Use)** of the Parent Agreement, namely for lawful research, development, testing, and related administrative and office activities consistent with a technology and research laboratory. All restrictions and obligations in Sections 2.2(b) and 2.2(c) regarding compliance with laws and prohibited activities shall apply equally to the expanded Premises.

(c) **Tenant Obligations for Additional Space.**  
Contoso’s obligations with respect to maintenance, no overloading, and hazardous materials under **Section 2.6 (Contoso’s Obligations Regarding Premises)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to the Amended Premises Scope.

  (v) Installation or upgrade of safety equipment (e.g., additional eyewash stations, emergency showers, signage, fire suppression upgrades) consistent with Applicable Laws and standard industry practices.

(b) **Design and Approval Process.**  
The Expanded Fit-Out Work shall be subject to the same process and approvals specified in **Section 2.4(b) (Approval and Coordination)** of the Parent Agreement. Quantum Labs shall prepare or coordinate design drawings and detailed work orders, which shall be subject to Contoso’s review and written approval. Any changes to the approved scope shall be handled under **Article XIII (Change Management)** of the Parent Agreement and **Article XIII of this Amendment**.

(c) **Ownership.**  
Consistent with **Section 2.4(c) (Ownership)** of the Parent Agreement, unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing, all permanently affixed tenant improvements created through the Expanded Fit-Out Work shall become the property of Quantum Labs upon installation and shall remain with the Premises upon termination or expiration of the Lease, without obligation to compensate Contoso therefor, except as reflected in the consideration built into the Amendment Contract Value.

2.4 **Enhanced Services (Supplement to Section 2.3 of Parent Agreement).**  

(a) **Additional Utilities and Resilience.**  
Quantum Labs shall, during the Amendment Term, provide Enhanced Services that supplement the Services described in **Section 2.3 (Services Provided by Quantum Labs)** of the Parent Agreement, including:

(b) **Enhanced Janitorial, Security, and Shared Facilities.**  
Quantum Labs shall increase janitorial frequency within the Amended Premises Scope and provide enhanced security coverage (such as higher CCTV coverage and stricter access control for certain lab areas) to support Contoso’s operations. Access to additional shared equipment (e.g., new imaging equipment, freezers, or high-end autoclaves) may be provided under updated usage rules and fee schedules referenced in this Amendment and consistent with **Section 2.3.5** of the Parent Agreement.

(c) **Performance Standards and Service Levels.**  
The Enhanced Services shall be provided in accordance with the performance standards in **Section 2.5 (Performance Standards)** and **Article XII (Service Level Agreements)** of the Parent Agreement, as further supplemented by **Article XII of this Amendment**. Where this Amendment provides stricter standards or additional remedies, such standards/remedies shall control with respect to the Enhanced Services.

2.5 **Supplemental Deliverables.**  
In connection with the Enhanced Services and Expanded Fit-Out Work, Quantum Labs shall deliver to Contoso the following Supplemental Deliverables during the Amendment Term:

  (a) Design and “as-built” drawings for the Expanded Fit-Out Work;

  (c) Updated building safety and evacuation plans reflecting the expanded Contoso footprint; and  
  (d) Periodic status reports (at least quarterly) summarizing service performance against the Amendment Service Levels.

The access rights set forth in **Section 2.7 (Access Rights and Hours)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to the Amended Premises Scope.

2.7 **Interplay with Existing Lease Term.**  
The Parties acknowledge that the Amendment Term (June 9, 2024 – July 14, 2025) is a defined period for commercial, pricing, and service adjustments established by this Amendment and does not shorten or extend the overall Lease Term or Expiration Date stated in **Article IV of the Parent Agreement**, unless the Parties expressly agree otherwise in writing under the change provisions of the Parent Agreement or under **Article XIII of this Amendment**.

2.8 **Reference to Master/Parent Agreement.**  
**This Amendment is executed under and subject to the terms of Lease Agreement reference number LSE-QUA-202403-492.** All rights and obligations not expressly modified herein shall be governed by the Parent Agreement, including Articles V through XVI, which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

2.9 **Priority of Documents.**  
In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Amendment and the terms of the Parent Agreement (contract_492), the terms of this Amendment shall control solely with respect to the subject matter expressly addressed herein (including the Amended Premises Scope, Enhanced Services, Expanded Fit-Out Work, Amendment Contract Value, and Amendment Term). For all other matters, the Parent Agreement shall control.

## ARTICLE III  
## FEES, RENT, AND PAYMENT TERMS (AMENDMENT)

3.1 **Amendment Contract Value.**  
The Parties agree that the **Amendment Contract Value** is **US $744,681**. This amount reflects:

  (a) Incremental Base Rent adjustments associated with the Amended Premises Scope during the Amendment Term;  
  (b) Additional charges for utilities, Enhanced Services, and shared equipment usage reasonably projected for the Amendment Term; and  
  (c) Amortized or one-time charges associated with the Expanded Fit-Out Work and related Supplemental Deliverables.

As in **Section 3.1** of the Parent Agreement, this Amendment Contract Value is a good‑faith estimate for planning and approval purposes and is **not** a cap or guarantee of total amounts payable.

3.2 **Adjusted Base Rent for Amendment Term.**  

(a) **Incremental Base Rent.**  
In addition to the Base Rent of **US $7,500.00 per month** specified in **Section 3.2(a)** of the Parent Agreement, Contoso shall pay incremental Base Rent for the additional Premises included in the Amended Premises Scope during the Amendment Term in the amount of **US $9,500.00 per month**. Accordingly, during the Amendment Term, the total monthly Base Rent for all Premises shall be **US $17,000.00**, subject to the annual adjustment mechanism in Section 3.3 of the Parent Agreement (three percent (3%) increases on the then‑current Base Rent).

(b) **Proration.**  
For partial calendar months at the start or end of the Amendment Term, the incremental Base Rent shall be prorated on a per diem basis, consistent with Section 3.2(b) of the Parent Agreement.

3.3 **Fit-Out and Capital Recovery Charges.**  

(a) **One-Time Fit-Out Fee.**  
Contoso shall pay a one-time **Expanded Fit-Out Fee** of **US $250,000.00**, covering the Expanded Fit-Out Work described in Section 2.3, payable as follows:

  (i) 30% (US $75,000.00) upon execution of this Amendment;  
  (ii) 40% (US $100,000.00) upon substantial completion of the fit-out (as reasonably determined by Quantum Labs and confirmed by a joint walk-through); and  
  (iii) 30% (US $75,000.00) upon delivery of final “as-built” documentation and commissioning reports.

(b) **Change Orders.**  
Any material changes to the Expanded Fit-Out Work requested by either Party and approved pursuant to **Article XIII (Change Management)** of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment may result in an equitable adjustment to the Expanded Fit-Out Fee, documented in written change orders.

3.4 **Payment Terms; Net 45.**  

(a) **Superseding Payment Terms for Amendment Fees.**  
Notwithstanding **Section 3.4 (Payment Terms; Net 30)** of the Parent Agreement, all undisputed Amendment Fees (including incremental Base Rent, Expanded Fit-Out Fees, and Enhanced Service charges) shall be due and payable **Net 45**, i.e., within forty‑five (45) calendar days following the date of the applicable invoice.

(b) **Invoices.**  
Quantum Labs shall continue to issue consolidated monthly invoices that clearly distinguish between (i) fees under the Parent Agreement, and (ii) Amendment Fees under this Amendment. Each invoice shall specify the period covered and the nature of each charge, consistent with Section 3.4(a) of the Parent Agreement.

(c) **Disputed Amounts.**  
The dispute process in **Section 3.4(c)** of the Parent Agreement applies to Amendment Fees, except that the timelines for notification shall be adapted to the Net 45 schedule: Contoso shall notify Quantum Labs of any good‑faith dispute within **twenty (20) days** after receipt of the invoice, specifying the nature of the dispute in reasonable detail. Contoso shall pay all undisputed portions by the due date, and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve disputed amounts.

3.5 **Additional Charges for Enhanced Services.**  

(a) **Utilities and Resilience Premium.**  
Quantum Labs may charge an incremental utilities and resilience premium for the Enhanced Services (including additional HVAC capacity, redundant power, and enhanced network resilience). The methodology for metering or allocation shall follow **Section 3.5.1** of the Parent Agreement. Any changes to pro rata shares as a result of the expanded Premises shall be documented in writing and applied prospectively.

(b) **Shared Equipment Usage Fees.**  
Where Contoso receives additional access to new or upgraded shared equipment under Section 2.4(b), such usage shall be subject to updated fee schedules communicated in writing and consistent with **Section 3.5.2** of the Parent Agreement.

(c) **After-Hours and Enhanced Security Services.**  
Enhanced security or after‑hours services requested by Contoso (e.g., dedicated guard coverage, extended building entry monitoring) shall be billed at Quantum Labs’ standard rates, as communicated in writing and consistent with **Section 3.5.3** of the Parent Agreement.

3.6 **Late Payment Penalties.**  

The late payment provisions in **Section 3.6** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to Amendment Fees, except that the initial 10‑day grace period shall be measured from the earlier of (a) forty‑five (45) days after invoice date; or (b) the date Contoso is otherwise required to pay under the Net 45 terms. Given the Parties’ Low Risk Profile, Quantum Labs agrees that before suspending any non‑essential Enhanced Services for non‑payment, it shall engage in good‑faith discussions with Contoso’s accounts payable contacts and provide at least **an additional 10 Business Days** to cure, absent a pattern of persistent delinquency.

3.7 **Taxes.**  

The tax obligations in **Section 3.7** of the Parent Agreement apply equally to Amendment Fees. Quantum Labs shall separately state any applicable sales, use, or similar taxes imposed on the Amendment Fees and shall provide reasonable supporting documentation upon request.

3.8 **Security Deposit.**  

The Security Deposit obligations in **Section 3.8** of the Parent Agreement remain in effect. At Quantum Labs’ reasonable discretion, considering the incremental risk associated with the Amended Premises Scope and Amendment Contract Value, Quantum Labs may request an increase of the Security Deposit up to an amount equal to one and one‑half (1.5) months of the then‑current total monthly Base Rent (inclusive of the Amendment incremental Base Rent), provided that any such increase is supported by reasonable justification and agreed in writing. Any such adjustment shall be documented in a short addendum referencing this Amendment and the Parent Agreement.

3.9 **No Withholding or Setoff.**  

The provisions of **Section 3.9 (No Withholding or Setoff)** of the Parent Agreement apply to Amendment Fees, except to the limited extent that any setoff is expressly authorized in this Amendment or in a written settlement agreement executed by both Parties.

## TERM AND TERMINATION (AMENDMENT)

4.1 **Amendment Term.**  

The Amendment Term shall commence on the **Amendment Effective Date (June 9, 2024)** and shall continue through **July 14, 2025**, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Article IV or under the relevant provisions of **Article IV of the Parent Agreement**. The expiration of the Amendment Term does not, by itself, terminate the Parent Agreement, which shall continue in effect until **December 19, 2027**, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Parent Agreement.

4.2 **Renewal of Amendment Term.**  

Notwithstanding the Renewal provisions in **Section 4.2** of the Parent Agreement, any renewal or extension of the Amendment-specific pricing or Enhanced Services shall require a separate written agreement between the Parties. The Lease renewal option covered by the Parent Agreement remains unaffected.

4.3 **Termination for Convenience – Amendment.**  

(a) **By Contoso.**  
In recognition of the Low Risk Profile and the client-friendly orientation of this Amendment, Contoso may terminate this Amendment (but not necessarily the Parent Agreement) for convenience, without cause, upon at least **thirty (30) days’ prior written notice** to Quantum Labs. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, such termination for convenience shall relieve Contoso of Amendment Fees accruing after the effective date of termination, but not of any obligations that have already accrued (including payment for completed Expanded Fit-Out Work and accrued rent).

(b) **By Quantum Labs.**  
Quantum Labs may terminate this Amendment for convenience upon at least **sixty (60) days’ prior written notice** to Contoso; provided, however, that Quantum Labs shall not exercise such right in a manner that unreasonably disrupts Contoso’s ongoing research and is subject to good‑faith discussions to mitigate adverse impacts. Termination of this Amendment by Quantum Labs for convenience shall not, by itself, terminate the Parent Agreement unless otherwise agreed.

4.4 **Termination for Cause.**  

The termination for cause provisions in **Section 4.4** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to this Amendment, mutatis mutandis. Any material breach of this Amendment shall be deemed a material breach of the Parent Agreement, and vice versa, if such breach affects the rights or obligations under both documents. Cure periods and procedures shall be as set forth in Section 4.4 of the Parent Agreement.

4.5 **Effect of Termination of Parent Agreement.**  

If the Parent Agreement (LSE-QUA-202403-492 / contract_492) is terminated or expires for any reason, this Amendment shall **automatically terminate** on the same effective date, without separate notice. In such event:

  (a) The obligations in **Section 4.5 of the Parent Agreement (Effect of Termination or Expiration)** shall apply to the Amended Premises Scope;  
  (b) All accrued Amendment Fees (including unpaid Expanded Fit-Out Fees, incremental Base Rent, and Additional Charges) through the effective date of termination shall become immediately due and payable; and  
  (c) Any Enhanced Services shall cease as of the termination date, except to the extent necessary to support an orderly wind‑down consistent with Section 4.5(c) of the Parent Agreement.

4.6 **Survival.**  

The survival provisions in **Section 4.6** of the Parent Agreement apply to this Amendment. In addition, provisions of this Amendment that by their nature should survive expiration or termination (including Articles V, VI, VIII, IX, XI, XIV, XV, and Sections 3.4–3.7 and 4.5–4.6) shall so survive.

---

## ARTICLE V  
## CONFIDENTIALITY

5.1 **Incorporation of Parent Agreement Terms.**  

The confidentiality provisions in **Article V (Confidentiality)** of the Parent Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and shall apply fully to all Confidential Information exchanged in connection with this Amendment, including financial terms, technical specifications for the Expanded Fit-Out Work, and service performance data associated with the Amendment Service Levels.

5.2 **Additional Confidential Information.**  

For purposes of this Amendment, “Confidential Information” shall expressly include, without limitation:

  (a) All engineering drawings, specifications, and commissioning data for the Expanded Fit-Out Work;  
  (b) Performance metrics and logs used to track compliance with the Amendment Service Levels;  
  (c) Pricing structures, discount schedules, and internal economic models used by either Party to evaluate the Amendment Contract Value; and  
  (d) Any proprietary health, safety, or security protocols relating to increased security or specialized lab operations in the Amended Premises Scope.

5.3 **Survival Period.**  

Notwithstanding **Section 5.6** of the Parent Agreement, and in recognition of the Low Risk Profile and Parties’ expectations, the obligations of confidentiality and non‑use with respect to Confidential Information exchanged **solely under this Amendment** shall survive for a period of **five (5) years** following the later of (a) expiration or termination of this Amendment, or (b) expiration or termination of the Parent Agreement, except with respect to trade secrets, which shall remain protected for so long as they qualify as trade secrets under Applicable Law.

6.1 **Background IP.**  

The Parties reaffirm the provisions of **Article VI (Intellectual Property Rights)** of the Parent Agreement, including **Section 6.1 (Ownership of Background IP)**. Each Party retains all rights in its Background IP. Nothing in this Amendment transfers ownership of either Party’s Background IP.

6.2 **Ownership of Contoso Work Product.**  

The rights in “Contoso Work Product” described in **Section 6.2** of the Parent Agreement remain unchanged. Any inventions, data, or other work product developed by Contoso using the Amended Premises Scope and Enhanced Services are owned exclusively by Contoso, subject to the same conditions as in the Parent Agreement.

6.3 **Quantum Labs Materials and Supplemental Deliverables.**  

The “Quantum Labs Materials” described in **Section 6.3** of the Parent Agreement remain the property of Quantum Labs.

6.4 **Limited License Adjustments.**  

The limited license to use the Premises and shared facilities in **Section 6.4** of the Parent Agreement is hereby supplemented to cover the Amended Premises Scope and Enhanced Services during the Amendment Term. The scope of permitted use remains as in Section 2.2(a) of the Parent Agreement.

6.5 **Restrictions and No Implied Licenses.**  

The restrictions in **Section 6.5** and the “No Implied Licenses” clause in **Section 6.6** of the Parent Agreement remain in full force and effect and apply equally to the Expanded Fit-Out Work and Supplemental Deliverables.

  (a) The design or performance of the Expanded Fit-Out Work to the extent such work causes bodily injury, property damage, or violation of Applicable Laws, except to the extent caused by Contoso’s misuse or modification; and  
  (b) Any claim that the Expanded Fit-Out Work or Quantum Labs’ building modifications infringe or misappropriate third‑party IP rights (excluding claims arising from Contoso‑specified designs or equipment).

8.3 **Additional Indemnification by Contoso.**  

Without limiting Article VIII of the Parent Agreement, Contoso shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Quantum Labs Indemnitees from and against Losses arising out of or relating to:

  (a) Contoso’s modification or misuse of the Expanded Fit-Out Work or the Amended Premises Scope; and

## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (AMENDMENT)

9.1 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  

The exclusion of consequential and similar damages in **Section 9.1** of the Parent Agreement is reaffirmed and applies equally to this Amendment.

9.2 **Adjusted Liability Cap for Amendment.**  

Notwithstanding **Section 9.2** of the Parent Agreement (which sets a cap at two (2) times the total fees paid or payable under the Agreement during the prior twelve (12) months), and in light of the Low Risk Profile and client‑friendly posture, the Parties agree that for claims arising **primarily out of this Amendment** (including Enhanced Services and Expanded Fit-Out Work), the aggregate liability of each Party shall not exceed **three (3) times** the total Amendment Fees paid or payable by Contoso to Quantum Labs under this Amendment during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim. For claims that cannot reasonably be apportioned between the Parent Agreement and this Amendment, the higher of the two applicable caps shall apply for the Party against whom the claim is made.

9.3 **Excluded Claims.**  

The exceptions listed in **Section 9.3 (Excluded Claims)** of the Parent Agreement apply equally to this Amendment (indemnification, confidentiality breaches, gross negligence, fraud, willful misconduct, and payment obligations).

9.4 **Applicability.**  

The Parties acknowledge that the limitations and exclusions set forth herein reflect a fair allocation of risk considering the **Amendment Contract Value of US $744,681**, the nature of the Amended Premises Scope and Enhanced Services, and the designation of the risk level as **Low**.

---

## ARTICLE X  
## INSURANCE (AMENDMENT)

10.1 **Incorporation of Parent Insurance Requirements.**  

The insurance obligations set forth in **Article X** of the Parent Agreement remain in full force and effect and apply to the Amended Premises Scope and activities under this Amendment.

10.2 **Additional Coverage Requirements.**  

Given the increased scale and complexity of the Amended Premises Scope and Expanded Fit-Out Work:

  (a) Quantum Labs shall ensure that its property insurance covers the Expanded Fit-Out Work and any additional building systems installed as part of this Amendment.  
  (b) Contoso shall review its own property and business interruption insurance to ensure coverage for its increased equipment and operations in the Amended Premises Scope and agrees to maintain coverage at levels commensurate with its increased exposure.

10.3 **Certificates of Insurance.**  

Upon reasonable request by either Party, the other Party shall provide updated certificates of insurance reflecting compliance with both **Article X of the Parent Agreement** and this Article X.

---

## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY (AMENDMENT)

11.1 **Incorporation.**  

The data protection and privacy provisions in **Article XI** of the Parent Agreement are incorporated herein and apply to any personal data processed in connection with the Enhanced Services (e.g., increased security systems, access control logs, and building monitoring).

11.2 **Additional Security Measures.**  

Quantum Labs shall implement any additional technical and organizational measures reasonably necessary to protect personal data processed through newly deployed or enhanced security systems in the Amended Premises Scope, consistent with **Section 11.3** of the Parent Agreement.

11.3 **Data Retention for Security Logs.**  

Security and access control logs for the Amended Premises Scope shall be retained for a period agreed by the Parties (e.g., twelve (12) to eighteen (18) months) unless a longer retention is required by Applicable Law or necessary for the investigation of a specific incident, after which such logs shall be securely deleted or anonymized.

---

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (AMENDMENT)

12.1 **Supplemental Uptime Commitment.**  

For Enhanced Services specifically related to critical building systems servicing the Amended Premises Scope, Quantum Labs shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure availability of at least **99.95%** of the time, measured on a calendar quarterly basis, excluding scheduled maintenance and Force Majeure Events. This supplements, and for those Enhanced Services supersedes, the 99.9% uptime commitment in **Section 12.1** of the Parent Agreement.

12.2 **Response Times.**  

For critical incidents affecting Enhanced Services in the Amended Premises Scope (e.g., full power outage, critical HVAC failure), Quantum Labs shall target initial response within **30 minutes** and best efforts to resolve within **two (2) hours** during the Amendment Term. For consistency, classification levels in **Section 12.3** of the Parent Agreement shall apply, but with these enhanced response targets where feasible.

12.3 **SLA Credits for Amendment.**  

If Quantum Labs materially fails to meet the enhanced uptime target or response times for Enhanced Services in a given quarter, Contoso may request a service credit equal to up to **20% of one (1) month’s incremental Base Rent** (i.e., 20% of the US $9,500.00 portion related to the Amendment) for that quarter, calculated based on the duration and severity of the outages. These credits are in addition to credits under **Section 12.4 of the Parent Agreement**, provided that the aggregate credits for a given quarter shall not exceed the incremental Base Rent for that quarter.

12.4 **Exclusive Monetary Remedy.**  

Consistent with **Section 12.4** of the Parent Agreement, the service credits described above shall constitute Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for SLA failures with respect to the Enhanced Services, without limiting other non-monetary remedies (e.g., termination rights) under this Amendment or the Parent Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT (AMENDMENT)

13.1 **Incorporation.**  

The change management procedures in **Article XIII** of the Parent Agreement apply to all changes to the Amended Premises Scope, Expanded Fit-Out Work, and Enhanced Services, except as specifically modified below.

13.2 **Change Requests Related to Amendment.**  

Change Requests that materially impact:

  (a) the Amendment Contract Value;  
  (b) the physical configuration of the Amended Premises Scope; or  
  (c) the Amendment Service Levels

shall be documented in writing, evaluated by the receiving Party, and, if agreed, memorialized in a written **Change Order** referencing this Amendment (AMD-QUA-202403-628) and the Parent Agreement (LSE-QUA-202403-492 / contract_492).

13.3 **Priority and Integration.**  

Executed Change Orders under this Amendment shall be deemed amendments to both the Parent Agreement and this Amendment as applicable. In case of conflict between a Change Order and this Amendment, the **most recently executed Change Order** shall prevail as to the matters expressly covered therein.

---

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION (AMENDMENT)

14.1 **Incorporation.**  

The dispute resolution provisions in **Article XIV** of the Parent Agreement, including negotiation, escalation, mediation, and arbitration/litigation options, are incorporated herein and apply to disputes arising under or related to this Amendment.

14.2 **Good-Faith Resolution of Operational Disputes.**  

The Parties acknowledge that many disputes under this Amendment may involve technical or operational issues (e.g., fit-out performance, SLA compliance). The Parties shall use reasonable efforts to involve appropriate technical personnel in the escalation process described in **Sections 14.1–14.2** of the Parent Agreement before proceeding to mediation or further legal action.

14.3 **Governing Law and Venue.**  

As reaffirmed in **Section 14.6** of the Parent Agreement, this Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **State of California**, without regard to its conflict-of-law principles. Any Dispute relating to this Amendment shall be resolved in the same venues described in **Section 14.4** of the Parent Agreement (San Francisco County, California).

## ARTICLE XV  
## FORCE MAJEURE (AMENDMENT)

15.1 **Incorporation.**  

The Force Majeure provisions in **Article XV** of the Parent Agreement are incorporated herein and apply equally to the obligations under this Amendment.

15.2 **Fit-Out and Enhanced Services.**  

In the event of a Force Majeure Event that materially impacts the Expanded Fit-Out Work or Enhanced Services, Quantum Labs shall:

  (a) Provide prompt written notice to Contoso describing the nature, impact, and anticipated duration of the event, consistent with **Section 15.2** of the Parent Agreement;  
  (b) Use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact, including partial or phased resumption of services where feasible; and  
  (c) Work with Contoso in good faith to adjust timelines and, if appropriate, fees.

15.3 **Extended Force Majeure – Amendment.**  

If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than **sixty (60) consecutive days** and materially impairs Contoso’s ability to use the **Amended Premises Scope** (even if some use of the original Premises remains possible), then either Party may terminate this Amendment upon **thirty (30) days’ prior written notice**, without liability other than obligations accrued prior to the effective date of termination. Termination of this Amendment under this Section does not automatically terminate the Parent Agreement unless separate termination rights under the Parent Agreement are also invoked.

## ARTICLE XVI  
## GENERAL PROVISIONS (AMENDMENT)

16.1 **Entire Agreement; Relationship to Parent Agreement.**  

This Amendment, together with the Parent Agreement (LSE-QUA-202403-492 / contract_492) and any Change Orders executed pursuant thereto, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the specific subject matter covered by this Amendment (Amended Premises Scope, Enhanced Services, Expanded Fit-Out Work, Amendment Fees, Amendment Term, and related provisions) and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements, understandings, or representations relating to such subject matter. In all other respects, the Parent Agreement remains the controlling agreement between the Parties.

16.2 **Amendments.**  

No amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision of this Amendment shall be effective unless in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both Parties, and any such amendment shall expressly reference this Amendment (AMD-QUA-202403-628) and the Parent Agreement (LSE-QUA-202403-492).

16.3 **Severability.**

16.4 **Waiver.**  

No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right or remedy under this Amendment shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise or the exercise of any other right or remedy.

16.5 **Notices.**  

All notices under this Amendment shall be given in the manner described in **Section 16.5 (Notices)** of the Parent Agreement, to the same addresses and contacts set forth therein, unless a Party has provided updated notice information in accordance with that Section.

16.6 **Assignment.**  

The assignment provisions in **Section 16.6** of the Parent Agreement apply to this Amendment.

16.7 **Independent Contractors.**  

The Parties remain independent contractors, as stated in **Section 16.7** of the Parent Agreement. Nothing in this Amendment shall be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, employment, or agency relationship.

16.9 **Counterparts; Electronic Signatures.**  

This Amendment may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together constitute one and the same instrument.

Headings used in this Amendment are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of any provision.
