## ARTICLE XII. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Service Availability.** For any Vendor-managed platform or service component provided under this Agreement, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve a monthly uptime of **99.9%** (the “**Availability Commitment**”), excluding (a) scheduled maintenance; (b) emergency maintenance; (c) downtime attributable to Client systems or third-party providers outside Vendor’s reasonable control; and (d) Force Majeure Events.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.** Vendor may perform scheduled maintenance during predefined maintenance windows upon at least five (5) Business Days’ prior notice to Client. Scheduled maintenance shall not exceed eight (8) hours per month and shall be excluded from downtime calculations.

12.3 **Incident Classification and Response Times.** Vendor shall respond to incidents based on the following severity levels:

  12.3.1 **Severity 1 (Critical):** Complete loss of mission-critical functionality with no workaround available and significant impact on Client’s core operations.  
  - Target Response Time: within 1 hour of incident report;  
  - Target Workaround Time: within 4 hours;  
  - Target Resolution Time: within 24 hours.

  12.3.2 **Severity 2 (High):** Significant degradation or partial loss of major functionality, with a workaround available but business impact still material.
