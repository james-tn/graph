The Service Provider may adjust its standard rates on an annual basis upon at least sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to the Company, provided that no such increase shall exceed five percent (5%) year‑over‑year during the Term absent mutual agreement.

3.2.3 **Expenses.** The Company shall reimburse the Service Provider for reasonable, pre‑approved out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred in connection with performing the Services, including travel, lodging, meals, and other project‑related costs, in accordance with the Company’s then‑current travel and expense policies as provided to the Service Provider in writing.

3.3 **Payment Terms.**

3.3.1 The Service Provider shall invoice the Company in accordance with the schedule and milestones set forth in the SOW(s). Unless otherwise stated, invoices for fixed‑fee milestones may be issued upon achievement of the relevant milestone or deemed acceptance of the corresponding Deliverable, and invoices for T&M Services and reimbursable expenses may be issued monthly in arrears.

3.3.2 The Company shall pay all undisputed amounts due under properly issued invoices within thirty (30) calendar days from the invoice date (“**Net 30**”). Payment shall be made in U.S. dollars by wire transfer or other mutually agreed method.

3.5 **Taxes.** All Fees and other amounts payable under this Agreement are exclusive of Taxes. The Company shall be responsible for all applicable Taxes, except for taxes based on the Service Provider’s net income, property, or employees. If the Company is required by Applicable Law to withhold Taxes from any payment, the Company shall (a) remit such Taxes to the appropriate tax authority, (b) provide reasonable documentation to the Service Provider evidencing such remittance, and (c) pay additional amounts to the Service Provider so that the net amount received equals the amount that would have been received absent such withholding, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

3.6 **No Set‑Off.** Except as expressly permitted under this Agreement or agreed in writing by the Parties, the Company shall not set off, deduct, or withhold any amounts from payments due to the Service Provider.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Services, or the Deliverables (a “**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through negotiations between executives with decision‑making authority.
