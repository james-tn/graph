8.1.1 Allegations that the Services or Deliverables (excluding Client Data and Client-provided materials) infringe any third party’s Intellectual Property Rights; or

8.1.3 Vendor’s material breach of its obligations under Articles V (Confidentiality) or XI (Data Protection and Privacy).

8.2.1 Client’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or

8.2.2 Client’s material breach of its obligations under this Addendum, including its obligations with respect to Client Data; or

8.3.1 The Party seeking indemnification (the **“Indemnified Party”**) shall:  
(a) promptly notify the other Party (the **“Indemnifying Party”**) in writing of any Claim for which it seeks indemnification, provided that failure to provide prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent it has been prejudiced thereby;  
(b) permit the Indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of the Claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party may not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party (other than payment of amounts indemnified hereunder) or admits fault on behalf of the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent; and  
(c) reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defense and settlement of the Claim.

8.3.2 The Indemnified Party may participate in the defense of any Claim with counsel of its choosing at its own expense.

8.4 **Infringement Remedies.**  
If the Services or Deliverables are, or in Vendor’s reasonable opinion are likely to become, the subject of an infringement Claim, Vendor may, at its option and expense:  
(a) procure for Client the right to continue using the allegedly infringing Services or Deliverables;  
(b) modify or replace the allegedly infringing Services or Deliverables to make them non-infringing, provided that the modified or replaced Services or Deliverables are substantially equivalent in functionality and performance; or  
(c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected Services or Deliverables and refund to Client any prepaid, unused Fees for the affected Services or Deliverables.  

This Section 8.4 sets forth Client’s exclusive remedy and Vendor’s entire liability for Claims of intellectual property infringement, subject to the limitations set forth in Article IX.
