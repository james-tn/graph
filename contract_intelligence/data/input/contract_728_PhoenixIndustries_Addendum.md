## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.** For purposes of Data Protection Laws, the Parties acknowledge that, with respect to Personal Data processed by Phoenix on behalf of Contoso in connection with the Services, Contoso is the “controller” (or equivalent term under applicable law) and Phoenix is the “processor” (or equivalent term).

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.** Phoenix shall process Personal Data only:

11.2.1 On documented instructions from Contoso, including with respect to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by UK or EU law;  

11.2.2 For the limited purpose of providing the Services and fulfilling its obligations under this Addendum; and  

11.2.3 In accordance with applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.3 **Security Measures.** Phoenix shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, as appropriate:

11.3.1 Encryption of Personal Data in transit and at rest, where reasonable and appropriate;  

11.3.2 Measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services;  

11.3.3 Measures to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of an Incident; and

11.4.1 Providing Contoso with prior written notice of the proposed sub-processor; and  

11.4.2 Entering into a written agreement with such sub-processor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set out in this Article XI.

Contoso may reasonably object to a proposed sub-processor on privacy or security grounds, in which case the Parties shall work in good faith to find an alternative solution. Phoenix shall remain fully liable for any acts or omissions of its sub-processors.

11.5 **Data Subject Rights and Requests.** Phoenix shall, taking into account the nature of the processing, assist Contoso by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as possible, in fulfilling Contoso’s obligations to respond to data subject requests under applicable Data Protection Laws. Phoenix shall promptly notify Contoso of any request from a data subject concerning Personal Data that Phoenix processes on Contoso’s behalf and shall not respond directly except on Contoso’s documented instructions or as required by law.

11.6 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of an Incident affecting Personal Data processed on behalf of Contoso, Phoenix shall:

11.6.1 Notify Contoso without undue delay and, where feasible, within forty-eight (48) hours after becoming aware of the Incident;  

11.6.2 Provide Contoso with sufficient information to enable Contoso to meet any reporting obligations under Data Protection Laws, including details of the nature of the Incident, the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records affected, and any likely consequences; and  

11.6.3 Cooperate with Contoso and take reasonable steps to mitigate the adverse effects of the Incident and to prevent its recurrence.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Phoenix shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by law.

11.8 **International Transfers.** To the extent the Services involve the transfer of Personal Data from the UK or EU to a third country not recognized as providing an adequate level of protection, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards, which may include standard contractual clauses or other transfer mechanisms recognized under Data Protection Laws.

11.9 **CCPA Compliance.** Where the CCPA applies, Phoenix shall act as a “service provider” and shall not:

11.9.1 Sell Personal Information (as defined in the CCPA);  

11.9.2 Retain, use, or disclose such Personal Information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the Services; or

13.4 **Emergency Changes.** In the event of an emergency affecting system stability or security, Phoenix may implement temporary changes without prior written approval, provided that Phoenix notifies Contoso as soon as reasonably practicable and submits a formal Change Request for retrospective approval.
