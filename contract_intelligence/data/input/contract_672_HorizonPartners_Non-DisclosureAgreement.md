## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  

Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its processing of Personal Data under this Agreement. To the extent Horizon processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso, Horizon shall act as a “processor” and Contoso shall act as a “controller” (as such terms are defined in the GDPR), and the provisions of this Article XI shall apply.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.**  

Horizon shall process Personal Data only:

  11.2.1 on documented instructions from Contoso, as set out in this Agreement and any applicable SOW; and  
  11.2.2 as necessary to perform the Services, unless otherwise required by applicable law, in which case Horizon shall inform Contoso of that legal requirement before such processing, unless prohibited by law.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  

Horizon shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, taking into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing and the risks to individuals.

11.4 **Sub‑Processors.**  

Horizon may engage Sub‑Processors to process Personal Data on its behalf, provided that:

  11.4.1 such Sub‑Processors are bound by written agreements imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement; and  

  11.4.2 Horizon remains fully liable for the acts and omissions of such Sub‑Processors as if they were its own.

11.5 **Data Subject Rights.**  

Horizon shall, taking into account the nature of the processing and to the extent permitted by law, assist Contoso by appropriate technical and organizational measures in fulfilling Contoso’s obligations to respond to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of access, rectification, erasure, and portability).

11.6 **Data Breach Notification.**  

In the event of a Personal Data breach affecting Personal Data processed by Horizon on behalf of Contoso, Horizon shall:

  11.6.1 notify Contoso without undue delay and, in any event, within seventy‑two (72) hours after becoming aware of the breach;

  11.6.2 provide Contoso with sufficient information to enable Contoso to meet its obligations to report or inform data subjects and/or regulators as required by Data Protection Laws; and  

  11.6.3 cooperate with Contoso and take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects and minimize any damage resulting from the breach.

11.7 **Data Transfers.**  

To the extent Horizon transfers Personal Data outside of the United Kingdom or European Economic Area in connection with the Services, Horizon shall ensure that such transfers comply with applicable Data Protection Laws, including, where required, the implementation of appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  

Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Contoso’s written request, Horizon shall, at Contoso’s option, delete or return all Personal Data to Contoso and delete existing copies, unless retention of the Personal Data is required by applicable law. Any retained Personal Data shall remain subject to the confidentiality and security obligations under this Agreement.

11.9 **Audit Rights.**  

Upon reasonable prior written notice and no more than once per year (unless there has been a Personal Data breach or legal requirement justifying additional audits), Contoso may audit, or appoint a third‑party auditor under obligations of confidentiality to audit, Horizon’s compliance with this Article XI, provided that such audit: (a) occurs during normal business hours; (b) does not unreasonably interfere with Horizon’s operations; and (c) is limited in scope to what is reasonably necessary to verify compliance.

  12.1.1 scheduled maintenance (with at least forty‑eight (48) hours’ prior notice to Contoso);  
  12.1.2 emergency maintenance required to address security or availability issues; and  
  12.1.3 downtime caused by factors outside Horizon’s reasonable control, including Force Majeure Events or failures of Contoso’s systems or third‑party systems.

12.2 **Response and Resolution Times.**  

Horizon shall adhere to the following target response and resolution times for support requests:

  - Initial response: within 1 hour  
  - Target workaround: within 4 hours

12.3 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.**  

If Horizon fails to meet the uptime commitment or response times set forth in this Article XII in a given calendar month, Contoso may be entitled to service credits to be mutually agreed and set forth in the applicable SOW. Such credits shall be Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy for SLA breaches, without prejudice to Contoso’s other rights in the event of chronic or material SLA failures.

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  

Either Party may, at any time, propose changes to the scope of Services, Deliverables, timelines, or other aspects of this Agreement or any SOW (each a “Change Request”). Change Requests shall be made in writing and shall include a description of the proposed change and the rationale therefor.

13.2 **Impact Assessment.**  

Upon receipt of a Change Request from Contoso, Horizon shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, assess and provide to Contoso:

  13.2.1 an evaluation of the technical and functional impact of the proposed change;  

  13.2.2 any impact on Fees, including any increase or decrease in the Contract Value; and  

  13.2.3 any impact on timelines, resources, and Service Levels.

13.3 **Approval of Changes.**  

No Change Request shall be binding unless and until it has been agreed in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both Parties (“Change Order”). Once executed, a Change Order shall form part of this Agreement and the Services shall be performed in accordance with its terms.

13.4 **Interim Work.**  

If Contoso requests that Horizon commence work in connection with a Change Request before a Change Order is finalized, Horizon shall be entitled to compensation on a time‑and‑materials basis at its standard rates until such Change Order is executed. If the Parties ultimately do not agree on the Change Order, Horizon shall be compensated for all work performed pursuant to Contoso’s written instructions up to the date Contoso directs Horizon to cease such work.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.**  

In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including its existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach, or termination (a “Dispute”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through negotiations between senior representatives of each Party.

14.2 **Escalation.**  

If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after written notice of the Dispute is given by one Party to the other, the Dispute shall be escalated to a senior executive of each Party, who shall meet (in person or remotely) and confer in good faith with a view to resolving the Dispute.

14.3 **Mediation.**  

If the Dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days after escalation in accordance with Section 14.2, the Parties shall consider in good faith submitting the Dispute to non‑binding mediation under the auspices of the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) in London or another mutually agreed mediation provider. The costs of mediation shall be borne equally by the Parties, unless otherwise agreed.

14.4 **Arbitration / Litigation.**  

If the Dispute is not resolved by negotiation and (if pursued) mediation within sixty (60) days from the date of the initial notice of Dispute, either Party may commence legal proceedings. Unless the Parties agree otherwise in writing:

  14.4.1 the Dispute shall be finally resolved by the courts of England and Wales, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction;  

  14.4.2 each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts; and  

  14.4.3 nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking urgent injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction at any time.

## ARTICLE XV  
## FORCE MAJEURE

15.1 **Definition.**  

A “Force Majeure Event” means any event or circumstance beyond a Party’s reasonable control that prevents or delays such Party from performing its obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, civil unrest, pandemics, government restrictions, labour disputes (excluding strikes confined to the workforce of the affected Party), failures of utilities or telecommunications, and failures of third‑party hosting or cloud services providers.

16.4 **Waiver.**  

No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power, or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right, power, or remedy, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or remedy.

All notices or other communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly given when:
