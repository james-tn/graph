Claims arising solely under the Parent Agreement remain subject to the liability limitations in **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement. If a claim reasonably cannot be segregated between this Amendment and the Parent Agreement, then the Parties agree that the larger of the two applicable caps shall apply, but in no event shall the same damages be recovered twice.

9.2 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and consistent with **Section 9.2** of the Parent Agreement, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill arising out of or relating to this Amendment, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

9.3 **Exceptions.**  

The limitations set forth in Section 9.1 shall not apply to:

(a) A Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII** of the Parent Agreement or this Amendment;

(b) A Party’s breach of confidentiality obligations under **Article V** of the Parent Agreement or this Amendment;

(c) A Party’s infringement or misappropriation of the other Party’s intellectual property rights; or

(d) Damages resulting from a Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.**  

The Parties acknowledge that the limitations and exclusions of liability in this Article IX reflect the low‑risk, client‑friendly allocation of risk contemplated in the Parent Agreement and have been factored into the pricing and commercial arrangements under this Amendment.
