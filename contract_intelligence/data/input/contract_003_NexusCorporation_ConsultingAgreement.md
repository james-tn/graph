## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations in connection with the performance of this Agreement, including, as applicable, the **General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”)**, the **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** and its amendments, and any similar or successor laws.

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.** To the extent the Service Provider processes Personal Data (as defined under applicable law) on behalf of the Company, the Parties shall enter into a separate data processing addendum (“**DPA**”) that complies with GDPR and other applicable laws, which shall be incorporated into and form part of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the DPA with respect to the processing of Personal Data, the DPA shall control.

11.3 **Security Measures.** The Service Provider shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data and Confidential Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, which measures shall be no less protective than those generally accepted in the consulting and technology services industry.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personal Data or Confidential Information in the Service Provider’s possession or control (a “**Data Breach**”), the Service Provider shall:

  (a) notify the Company without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  

  (b) provide the Company with reasonable information about the nature and extent of the Data Breach, including the categories of data and data subjects affected, to the extent known;  

  (c) take prompt steps to contain, investigate, and remediate the Data Breach, and to mitigate any adverse effects; and  

  (d) cooperate reasonably with the Company, at the Company’s expense, in any notifications to affected individuals, regulators, or other parties, and in any remediation efforts reasonably requested by the Company.

11.5 **Data Retention and Deletion.** The Service Provider shall retain Client Materials and Personal Data only as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by applicable law. Upon the Company’s written request or upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Service Provider shall securely delete or return all Client Materials and Personal Data, except to the extent retention is required by law, in which case the Service Provider shall continue to protect such data in accordance with this Agreement.

11.6 **Cross-Border Transfers.** To the extent the Services involve the transfer of Personal Data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland to a country that does not provide an adequate level of data protection under applicable laws, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or other mechanisms approved by relevant authorities, as set forth in the DPA.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Applicability.** To the extent the Services include ongoing support, managed services, or hosting of any solutions or Deliverables, the Service Levels set forth in this Article XII and/or the applicable SOW shall apply.

12.2 **Availability/Uptime.** For any hosted or managed solution operated by the Service Provider on behalf of the Company, the Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the solution is available at least **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance windows and downtime caused by Force Majeure Events or the Company’s acts or omissions.

12.3 **Response and Resolution Times.** The Service Provider shall respond to and work to resolve support incidents reported by the Company in accordance with the priority levels defined in the applicable SOW, which may include targets such as:

12.5 **Exclusions.** Service Levels shall not apply, and no Service Credits shall be due, to the extent a failure to meet Service Levels is caused by: (a) the Company’s or its third-party vendors’ systems or networks; (b) misuse of the Services or solutions by the Company; (c) scheduled maintenance; or (d) a Force Majeure Event.

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.2 **Evaluation of Change Requests.** Upon receipt of a Change Request, the receiving Party shall review and respond within a reasonable time, indicating: (a) acceptance; (b) rejection; or (c) a request for further discussion or clarification. If the Change Request affects the scope, Fees, or timelines, the Service Provider shall provide a written impact assessment, including any proposed adjustments to Fees, milestones, or resources.

13.3 **Change Orders.** No Change Request shall become effective unless and until it is documented in a Change Order signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Each Change Order shall expressly reference the SOW being modified and set forth the agreed changes.

13.4 **Effect on Services.** Until a Change Order is executed, the Parties shall continue to perform their obligations in accordance with the then-current SOW. The Company shall not be obligated to pay for any additional work performed by the Service Provider that is outside the scope of a SOW unless such work has been authorized in a signed Change Order.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION, GOVERNING LAW, AND VENUE

14.4 **Arbitration or Litigation.** If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days after appointment of the mediator, either Party may pursue any remedies available at law or in equity. Unless the Parties otherwise agree in writing, any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be instituted in the state or federal courts located in **Wilmington, Delaware**, and each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.

14.5 **Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of **Delaware**, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

14.6 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information or Intellectual Property Rights, without first complying with the negotiation and mediation procedures in this Article XIV.
