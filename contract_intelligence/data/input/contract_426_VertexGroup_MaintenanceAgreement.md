## ARTICLE II. SCOPE OF MAINTENANCE SERVICES

2.1 **Relationship to Parent Agreement.**  

(a) This Agreement is executed pursuant to and supplements the Parent Agreement. As between this Agreement and the Parent Agreement, the Parent Agreement remains the overarching master agreement governing licensing, intellectual property rights, confidentiality, data protection, limitations of liability, and general provisions.  

(b) The Maintenance Services provided under this Agreement constitute part of the "**Maintenance Services**" and "**Services**" defined in **Sections 1.13 and 1.15** and described in **Section 2.3(e)** and **Article XII** of the Parent Agreement.  

(c) In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Parent Agreement with respect to Maintenance Services, **this Agreement shall control** solely with respect to the Maintenance Services, except where expressly stated herein that a provision of the Parent Agreement prevails.

2.2 **Overview of Maintenance Services.**  

Vertex shall provide Maintenance Services to Contoso for the Supported Software throughout the Maintenance Term. Such Maintenance Services shall include, at a minimum:

(a) **Incident Management and Technical Support.**  
   - Intake and logging of all Incidents and Service Requests via a designated helpdesk or ticketing system (phone, email, or portal).  
   - Classification and prioritization of Incidents by severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low) consistent with **Section 12.3 (Response Times)** of the Parent Agreement.  
   - Initial triage, diagnosis, and escalation internally within Vertex as necessary.  
   - Provision of workarounds or permanent fixes aimed at returning the Supported Software to normal operation.

(b) **Error Correction and Bug Fixes.**  
   - Identification, analysis, and remediation of Errors in the Supported Software.  
   - Development and deployment of patches, hotfixes, or Updates to correct verified Errors, prioritized by severity and business impact.  
   - Regression testing of fixes to avoid material adverse effects on existing functionality.

(c) **Updates and Upgrades.**  
   - Provision of **Updates** (minor changes, bug fixes, patches, minor enhancements) to Contoso without additional license fees, consistent with **Section 1.19** (Update) and **Section 2.3(e)** of the Parent Agreement.  
   - Provision of **Upgrades** (major releases, significant enhancements) in accordance with the Parent Agreement, which may be subject to additional fees unless otherwise agreed in writing. Where Upgrades are included in the Maintenance Fee, such inclusion shall be specified in **Section 3.2** of this Agreement.

(d) **Performance Monitoring and Preventive Maintenance.**  
   - Monitoring of the production environment of the Supported Software to identify performance bottlenecks and stability issues.  
   - Implementation of preventive maintenance tasks such as log management, capacity reviews, and optimization of configurations in cooperation with Contoso’s technical team.  
   - Recommendations to Contoso regarding environmental changes (e.g., infrastructure, databases, networks) to maintain or improve performance.

(e) **Configuration Assistance and Advisory Services.**  
   - Reasonable assistance in configuring standard features of the Supported Software (excluding custom development) to support Contoso’s evolving business processes, provided such assistance does not constitute new professional services outside the scope of maintenance.  
   - Provision of guidance on best practices for use of the Supported Software, including recommendations on security, user roles, workflows, and reporting.

(f) **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer.**  
   - Provision of release notes, technical bulletins, and other documentation for Updates and Upgrades.  
   - Maintenance of an online knowledge base or documentation repository accessible to Contoso’s designated administrators, where practicable.

2.3 **Service Levels and Response Times.**  

(a) Vertex shall provide Maintenance Services in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with generally accepted industry standards and the service level objectives set out in **Article XII (Service Level Agreements)** of the Parent Agreement.  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Vertex shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet or exceed the response time targets for Incidents as described in **Section 12.3** of the Parent Agreement:  
   - Severity 1 (Critical): initial response within 1 hour (24x7);  
   - Severity 2 (High): initial response within 4 hours during Business Hours;  
   - Severity 3 (Medium): initial response within 1 Business Day;  
   - Severity 4 (Low): initial response within 2 Business Days.  

(c) The Parties acknowledge that these response times are service level objectives and not absolute guarantees; however, **persistent or material failures** may constitute a material breach under **Article IV** of this Agreement and, when taken together with the uptime commitments in **Section 12.1 of the Parent Agreement**, may give rise to termination rights and other remedies.

2.4 **Uptime and Availability.**  

(a) For any hosted or cloud-based deployment of the Supported Software, Vertex shall maintain an Uptime Percentage of at least **99.9%** per calendar month, measured and calculated in accordance with **Section 12.1** of the Parent Agreement, subject to the exclusions set forth therein and in **Section 12.5** of the Parent Agreement.  

(b) Service credits for failure to meet such Uptime Percentage shall be calculated and applied in accordance with **Section 12.4** of the Parent Agreement, and such service credits shall constitute Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for uptime failures, without prejudice to Contoso’s rights to terminate this Agreement under **Article IV** for persistent breaches.

2.5 **Scope Limitations.**  

The Maintenance Services **do not include** the following, which, if requested by Contoso, shall be treated as additional professional services under separate SOWs subject to **Article II, Section 2.7** and **Article XIII** of the Parent Agreement:

(a) New custom development, including new integrations, new custom code, or significant new workflows beyond configuration of existing capabilities;  

(b) Major data migration efforts or large-scale data remediation not related to a Vertex-caused Error;  

(c) On-site support at Contoso’s locations, except as specifically included in an applicable SOW;  

(d) Support for Third-Party Systems or customizations not originally provided or certified by Vertex;  

(e) Any work required due to misuse of the Supported Software, failure to follow Documentation, or modifications made by or on behalf of Contoso without Vertex’s written consent.

2.6 **Contoso Responsibilities.**  

Contoso acknowledges that Vertex’s performance of the Maintenance Services is dependent on Contoso’s timely performance of its responsibilities, which are consistent with **Section 2.6 (Contoso Responsibilities)** of the Parent Agreement, including:

(a) Providing Vertex with timely and reasonable access to relevant systems, logs, technical resources, and personnel as needed to investigate and resolve Incidents;  

(b) Designating qualified technical contacts to interact with Vertex support personnel;  

(c) Implementing and maintaining an appropriate technical environment (networks, servers, databases, operating systems) consistent with Vertex’s published system requirements;  

(d) Applying Updates, patches, and other remedial instructions within a reasonable time after delivery by Vertex, particularly where security or stability is concerned;  

(e) Ensuring that user issues submitted as Incidents are reproducible, documented, and, where appropriate, first checked against internal user training and Documentation resources.

Vertex shall not be liable for delays or failures in performing the Maintenance Services to the extent caused by Contoso’s failure to perform its responsibilities or by any other act or omission of Contoso or its agents, consistent with **Section 2.6** of the Parent Agreement.

2.7 **Relationship to Statements of Work.**  

To the extent that any SOW executed under the Parent Agreement describes support, maintenance, or sustainment activities, such SOW shall be read in conjunction with this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between a SOW and this Agreement regarding Maintenance Services, this Agreement shall govern unless the SOW expressly states that it supersedes specific provisions of this Agreement and identifies such provisions with specificity (aligning with **Section 2.7** of the Parent Agreement).
