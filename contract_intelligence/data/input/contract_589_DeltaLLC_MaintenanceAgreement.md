2.2 **Detailed Scope and Deliverables.**  
The specific scope of Services, the Covered Assets, sites, and any Deliverables shall be described in one or more SOWs referencing this Agreement. In the absence of a separate SOW, the following baseline obligations shall apply:

  (a) **Asset Register.** Within sixty (60) days after the Effective Date, the Vendor shall, in collaboration with the Client, prepare and maintain an asset register listing all Covered Assets, including location, model, serial number (where applicable), and criticality ranking (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, non-critical). The asset register shall be deemed a Deliverable.

  (b) **Preventive Maintenance Schedule.** Within ninety (90) days after the Effective Date, the Vendor shall prepare a preventive maintenance schedule for all Covered Assets, including the frequency and nature of each preventive maintenance activity.

The Vendor shall take commercially reasonable efforts to diagnose and resolve each Incident, including dispatching qualified technicians to the affected site when required.

  (e) **Recommendations and Lifecycle Planning.** The Vendor shall periodically provide written recommendations concerning asset upgrades, replacements, and lifecycle management, including cost estimates and risk assessments for critical assets.

2.3 **Performance Standards.**  
The Vendor shall perform the Services:

  (a) in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with generally accepted industry standards and practices for similar services;  

  (b) in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including occupational health and safety requirements;

The Client shall:

  (a) provide the Vendor and its personnel with reasonable access to the Covered Assets, Client premises, and any related systems or documentation as necessary for the Vendor to perform the Services;

2.6 **High-Risk Acknowledgement.**  
The Parties acknowledge that the Covered Assets may be critical to the Client’s business operations and that interruptions may cause significant commercial losses. Accordingly, the Client expressly agrees that the Services, while designed to reduce the likelihood and impact of failures, do not constitute a guarantee of uninterrupted operation, and the risk allocation and liability provisions of Articles VIII and IX have been negotiated to reflect this high-risk profile and shall be interpreted accordingly in favor of the Vendor.
