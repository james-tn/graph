8.3.2 The indemnified Party may participate in the defense of the Claim at its own expense with counsel of its choice.

## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY  

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its performance under this Agreement. To the extent Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of Client, Vendor shall act as a “processor” or “service provider” (as such terms are defined under applicable law), and Client shall act as “controller” or “business.”

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.** Vendor shall process Personal Data only: (a) in accordance with Client’s documented instructions as set forth in this Agreement and the applicable SOW; and (b) for the purposes of performing its obligations under this Agreement. Vendor shall not “sell” or “share” (as defined under CCPA) Personal Data or use Personal Data for Vendor’s own commercial purposes or for any purpose other than providing the Services to Client.

11.3 **Security Measures.** Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data and Client Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, appropriate to the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing and the risks to individuals. Such measures shall include, at a minimum: access controls; encryption in transit; secure development practices; vulnerability management; and incident response procedures.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Vendor may engage subcontractors (including subprocessors) to process Personal Data on its behalf, provided that: (a) Vendor enters into a written agreement with each such subprocessor imposing data protection obligations at least as protective as those set forth in this Agreement; and (b) Vendor remains fully liable for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors. Upon request, Vendor shall provide Client with a list of subprocessors processing Personal Data on its behalf.
