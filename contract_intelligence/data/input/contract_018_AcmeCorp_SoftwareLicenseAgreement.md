Such services may include requirements gathering, system design, configuration of workflows, data migration planning and execution, testing, user acceptance testing support, and production cutover.

2.3.2 Acme shall use commercially reasonable efforts to perform such services in accordance with the milestones and indicative timelines specified in Schedule C. Unless otherwise agreed, the Parties anticipate the following high-level phases:

  - **Phase 1 – Discovery and Design (Estimated 6–8 weeks):** Acme will conduct workshops with Contoso to refine functional and technical requirements, confirm integration points, and produce a detailed design document. Deliverables will include a requirements traceability matrix and an implementation design document.

  - **Phase 2 – Configuration and Integration (Estimated 8–12 weeks):** Acme will configure the Software according to the agreed design, including user roles and permissions, workflows, forms, and business rules.

  - **Phase 3 – Data Migration and Testing (Estimated 4–6 weeks):** Acme will assist Contoso in planning and executing data migration from legacy systems to the Software.

2.3.3 The foregoing timelines are estimates only and not guaranteed deadlines. Any delays caused by Contoso’s failure to perform its obligations (including timely provision of information, resources, and approvals) shall extend the timelines on a day-for-day basis and may result in additional Fees as further described in Article III.

  (b) modify or replace the Software so that it becomes non-infringing while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or  

  (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected license and refund to Contoso any prepaid, unused Fees for the affected Software for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term.  

This Section 8.3 states Acme’s sole and exclusive liability, and Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy, for any IP infringement or misappropriation Claims relating to the Software.

8.4 **Contoso Indemnification.** Contoso shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Acme, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, “**Acme Indemnitees**”) from and against any and all Losses arising out of or relating to any Claim:

  (a) alleging that the Client Data or Contoso’s use of the Software (other than as a result of the Software itself) infringes, misappropriates, or violates any third-party rights (including Intellectual Property Rights or privacy rights);  

  (b) arising from Contoso’s violation of any Law, including Data Protection Laws, in connection with its use of the Software or Services; or  

  (c) arising from Contoso’s breach of Section 2.6 (Restrictions on Use) or Section 7.4.

8.5 **Indemnification Procedure.** The indemnified Party must:  

  (a) promptly notify the indemnifying Party in writing of any Claim for which it seeks indemnification (provided that failure to provide timely notice shall relieve the indemnifying Party of its obligations only to the extent it is materially prejudiced thereby);  

  (b) give the indemnifying Party sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim (except that the indemnifying Party may not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any admission of liability or non-monetary obligations on the indemnified Party without its prior written consent); and  

  (c) provide the indemnifying Party with reasonable cooperation and assistance, at the indemnifying Party’s expense.

8.6 **Additional Protection for Vendor (High-Risk Allocation).** The Parties acknowledge the high-risk nature of the engagement and agree that Contoso’s indemnification obligations under Section 8.4 are broad and shall extend to all third-party Claims arising from or relating to Client’s business operations and data, except to the extent such Claims arise solely from Acme’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

9.3 **Fair Allocation Acknowledgement.** The Parties acknowledge that:  

  (a) the Fees reflect the allocation of risks and the uncapped nature of liability under this Agreement;  

  (b) each Party has had the opportunity to consult with legal counsel regarding the implications of uncapped liability and the inclusion of consequential damages; and
