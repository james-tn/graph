11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Laws relating to data protection and privacy, including, as applicable, **GDPR**, **CCPA**, and any local privacy laws in the jurisdictions where the Services are provided or where data subjects reside.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  
For purposes of GDPR and similar laws, the Parties acknowledge that:  
(a) the Client is generally the “data controller” (or equivalent) in respect of Personal Data contained in Client Data; and  
(b) Vendor acts as a “data processor” (or equivalent) with respect to such Personal Data in performing the Services. Vendor shall process Personal Data solely on the documented instructions of the Client and as necessary to perform the Services, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data and Client Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to such data, consistent with industry standards and in compliance with Applicable Law.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed unauthorized access to, or disclosure of, Personal Data or Client Data resulting from Vendor’s breach of its security obligations (a “**Data Breach**”), Vendor shall:  
(a) notify the Client without undue delay and, in any event, within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  
(b) provide reasonable information regarding the nature and extent of the Data Breach, the types of data affected, and the steps taken or to be taken to mitigate the effects and prevent recurrence; and  
(c) cooperate with the Client in complying with any required notifications to data subjects or regulators, at the Client’s cost unless the Data Breach is caused solely by Vendor’s failure to meet its security obligations.

11.5 **Subprocessors.**  
Vendor may engage subprocessors to process Personal Data, provided that Vendor:  
(a) imposes on such subprocessors data protection obligations substantially similar to those set forth in this Article XI; and  
(b) remains responsible for the acts and omissions of such subprocessors. Upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall provide a list of key subprocessors involved in data processing activities relevant to the Client.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.**  
Vendor shall, to the extent reasonably practicable and at the Client’s expense (unless otherwise required by Applicable Law), assist the Client in responding to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights (e.g., access, rectification, erasure) under Applicable Law, where such requests relate to Personal Data processed by Vendor on behalf of the Client.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Vendor shall retain Client Data, including Personal Data, only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, Vendor shall, at the Client’s option, either return or securely delete Client Data in its possession or control, except to the extent retention is required by Applicable Law or for legitimate archival purposes. Any retained Client Data shall remain subject to the obligations of confidentiality and data security under this Agreement.

12.1 **Service Availability.**  
Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the production environment of the hosted software is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, with a monthly uptime percentage of at least **99.9%**, excluding downtime due to:  
(a) scheduled maintenance (of which Vendor shall provide at least 48 hours’ advance notice where practicable);  
(b) emergency maintenance necessary to address critical security or performance issues;  
(c) Force Majeure Events; or  
(d) failures of Client systems or Third-Party Products outside Vendor’s reasonable control.

  - **Severity 2 (High)** – Major functionality impacted with no acceptable workaround: initial response within **4 hours**, work during business hours until resolution or acceptable workaround.  
  - **Severity 3 (Medium)** – Non-critical issue or partial loss of functionality: initial response within **1 Business Day**.  
  - **Severity 4 (Low)** – Minor issue or general inquiry: initial response within **3 Business Days**.

12.3 **SLA Credits.**  
If Vendor fails to meet the monthly uptime Service Level in Section 12.1 due solely to Vendor-controlled causes, the Client shall be entitled to **service credits** as follows:

  - Monthly uptime < 98.0%: credit equal to 20% of the monthly subscription fee.

Service credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall be the Client’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for failure to meet uptime Service Levels, without prejudice to any other rights in case of persistent or material breaches.

12.4 **Exclusions.**  
Service Levels shall not apply to failures or incidents caused by:  
(a) the Client’s misuse of the software or Deliverables;  
(b) unauthorized modifications by the Client or third parties;

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  
Either Party may propose changes to the scope of Services, Deliverables, timelines, or other aspects of this Agreement (each, a “**Change Request**”). Any Change Request shall be submitted in writing and describe the proposed change, rationale, and expected impact on Fees, schedule, and resources.

13.2 **Change Order Process.**  
Upon receipt of a Change Request, Vendor shall evaluate the impact of the requested change and, within a reasonable period, provide the Client with a written proposal (a “**Change Order**”) specifying:  
(a) the revised scope of work;  
(b) any adjustments to Fees;

A Change Order shall become binding only upon execution by authorized representatives of both Parties. Until then, Vendor shall continue performing the Services in accordance with the then-current scope and schedule.

13.3 **Impact on Performance.**  
The Parties acknowledge that certain Change Requests may affect Vendor’s ability to meet previously agreed timelines or Service Levels.
