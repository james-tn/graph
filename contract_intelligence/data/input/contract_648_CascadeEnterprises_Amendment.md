This Amendment is intended to modify, expand, and supplement these provisions as expressly set forth below with respect to the Amended Premises and Additional Services.

2.2 **Expansion and Reconfiguration of Premises.**

2.2.1 **Expansion.** With effect from the Amendment Effective Date, and subject to the terms of the Parent Agreement as modified by this Amendment, Cascade hereby leases to Contoso, and Contoso hereby leases from Cascade, in addition to the Parent Premises:

  (a) an additional contiguous office area located on the 26th floor, designated **Suite 26-04**, comprising approximately **3,000 square feet** of net lettable area; and  

  (b) a non‑contiguous storage and equipment area located on the 7th floor, designated **Storage Unit 7-S-12**, comprising approximately **500 square feet** of net lettable area and intended for records storage, IT equipment staging, and ancillary uses.

These additional spaces together with the Parent Premises shall constitute the **Amended Premises** for all purposes of this Amendment and the Parent Agreement.

2.2.2 **Use of Additional Spaces.** The use restrictions set out in **Section 2.2 (Use of Premises)** of the Parent Agreement remain in full force and effect and shall apply to the Amended Premises. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

  (a) Suite 26-04 shall be used solely for general commercial office purposes consistent with **Section 2.2.1** of the Parent Agreement; and  

  (b) Storage Unit 7-S-12 shall be used solely for lawful storage, equipment staging, and ancillary purposes directly related to Contoso’s operations in the Amended Premises, and shall not be used for any hazardous, flammable, or otherwise regulated materials without Cascade’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.

2.3 **Additional Services and Enhanced Facilities Management.**

2.3.1 **Base Building and Facilities Management.** In addition to the Services described in **Section 2.3.1 (Building Operations and Maintenance)** of the Parent Agreement, Cascade shall:

  (a) extend all existing building systems servicing the Parent Premises to adequately service Suite 26-04 and Storage Unit 7-S-12, including HVAC distribution, electrical power, fire protection, and security systems;  

  (b) maintain, repair, and where necessary replace any newly installed base building components attributable to the expansion, in accordance with the same standard of care described in **Section 2.5.1** of the Parent Agreement; and  

  (c) implement an integrated access control regime for all components of the Amended Premises, maintaining separate access profiles and logs for Contoso consistent with **Section 2.3.3 (Security Services)** and **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)**.

2.3.2 **Cleaning Services.** The obligations under **Section 2.3.2 (Cleaning Services)** of the Parent Agreement shall be expanded to cover Suite 26-04 and Storage Unit 7-S-12. Contoso acknowledges that specialized cleaning of Storage Unit 7-S-12 (for equipment, records, or sensitive materials) may be subject to additional charges, to be invoiced as part of **Additional Services** in accordance with **Article III** of this Amendment.

2.3.3 **Utilities and After‑Hours Services.** The provisions of **Section 2.3.4 (Utilities)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to the entire Amended Premises. For the avoidance of doubt:

  (a) Electricity, water, and standard office‑spec HVAC for Suite 26-04 shall be provided during normal business hours as part of Service Charges, at allocation ratios set out in the Amendment Rent Schedule;  

  (b) Storage Unit 7-S-12 shall have sufficient electrical capacity for racking, lighting, and light equipment use; any additional dedicated power or enhanced cooling shall be treated as Tenant‑specific works, billable under **Section 3.8** of the Parent Agreement as modified through this Amendment; and  

  (c) After‑hours HVAC for the Amended Premises shall be provided at Cascade’s then‑prevailing rates, as updated from time to time upon thirty (30) days’ notice, and shall be invoiced monthly in arrears with Net 30 terms.

2.4 **Fit-Out and Alterations for Amended Premises.**

2.4.1 **Landlord‑Performed Fit-Out.** In addition to the fit‑out arrangements contemplated in **Section 2.4.1** of the Parent Agreement, Cascade shall perform initial fit‑out works within Suite 26-04 in accordance with a mutually agreed fit‑out plan, to include:

  (a) construction of at least three (3) enclosed meeting rooms, one (1) collaboration zone, and an extended pantry area integrated with existing pantry facilities in the Parent Premises;  

  (b) provision of raised flooring and cable management aligned with Contoso’s existing IT standards; and  

  (c) installation of LED lighting, HVAC diffusers, smoke detectors, and access control hardware consistent with building standards.

Such works shall be completed within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days from the Amendment Effective Date, subject to Force Majeure Events, and shall be funded as part of the Amendment Contract Value and the capital cost recovery mechanisms in **Sections 3.1 and 3.2** of this Amendment.

2.4.2 **Tenant‑Performed Works.** Any Contoso‑initiated alterations or additional fit‑out within the Amended Premises shall continue to be subject to **Section 2.4.2** of the Parent Agreement, including prior written approval requirements, building rules compliance, and restoration obligations under **Section 4.5.1(b)** of the Parent Agreement, as further reinforced by **Section 4.5** of this Amendment.

2.5 **Performance Standards and High‑Risk Context.**

2.5.1 The performance standards set out in **Section 2.5 (Performance Standards)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to all Additional Services and to the Amended Premises. Given the **High‑Risk Classification** of this Amendment, Cascade shall maintain at least the same level of diligence and care, and shall comply with any enhanced performance metrics described in **Article XII (Service Level Agreements)** of this Amendment.

2.5.2 Contoso acknowledges that more comprehensive uptime, response, and resolution commitments are being introduced through **Article XII** of this Amendment, and that failures to meet such commitments may give rise to service credits and, where material or repeated, to rights of termination for cause under **Section 4.4** of this Amendment.

2.6 **Access, Security, and Cooperation.**

2.6.1 **Access.** Cascade shall provide Contoso with secure access to Suite 26-04 and Storage Unit 7-S-12 in accordance with **Section 2.6.1** of the Parent Agreement. Access to Storage Unit 7-S-12 may be subject to more stringent security controls (e.g., multi-factor authentication, restricted card access) at Cascade’s discretion, provided such controls do not unreasonably impede Contoso’s legitimate access needs.

2.6.2 **Cooperation.** Contoso shall provide reasonable cooperation for extended maintenance windows necessary to integrate and maintain building systems servicing the Amended Premises, and shall allow Cascade and its contractors access at times reasonably required for such purposes, consistent with **Section 2.6.2** of the Parent Agreement.

2.7 **Supplemental Deliverables.**

2.7.1 In addition to the Deliverables listed in **Section 2.7** of the Parent Agreement, Cascade shall provide the following **Supplemental Deliverables**:

  (a) updated as‑built drawings covering Suite 26-04 and Storage Unit 7-S-12, including M&E layouts;

  (c) quarterly utility consumption reports (where metered or sub‑metered) for the Amended Premises; and  

  (d) security access logs and incident summaries specifically relating to the Amended Premises, subject to privacy, security, and data protection requirements under **Article XI** of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment.

2.7.2 Deliverables under this Section shall be provided at no additional cost unless otherwise specified in the Amendment Rent Schedule or expressly agreed in writing as Additional Services subject to separate Fees.

2.8 **Limitations on Services (Clarification).** The limitations on services set out in **Section 2.8** of the Parent Agreement remain applicable to the Amended Premises. For clarity, Cascade shall not be responsible for specialized environmental controls or IT infrastructure within Storage Unit 7-S-12 beyond standard building specifications, unless expressly agreed in writing and priced as Additional Services under **Article III** of this Amendment.

## ARTICLE III – FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS (AMENDED)

3.1 **Revised Contract Value.** Section 3.1 of the Parent Agreement is hereby amended and restated solely for the period and scope covered by this Amendment as follows:

> “Subject to the terms of this Agreement as amended by Amendment AMD-CAS-202411-648, the total estimated contract value for the Extended Term, including Base Rent, Service Charges, fit‑out contributions for the expansion, and any included additional services, shall be **USD 2,274,562** (the **‘Amendment Contract Value’**). This amount may be adjusted in accordance with this Agreement and the Amendment for additional services, legally mandated increases, or mutually agreed variations.”

3.2 **Amendment Rent Schedule and Components.**

3.2.1 The Parties agree that the **Amendment Rent Schedule (Schedule 1)** shall specify:

  (a) monthly Base Rent amounts allocated between the Parent Premises, Suite 26-04, and Storage Unit 7-S-12;  

  (b) an itemized breakdown of Service Charges for the Amended Premises;  

  (c) indicative utility charge methodologies (metered, sub‑metered, or pro‑rated) applicable to the Amended Premises; and  

  (d) any amortized capital recovery amounts relating to Cascade’s fit‑out and base building enhancement costs.

3.2.2 Section 3.2.1 of the Parent Agreement (regarding Base Rent and Rent Schedule) is deemed supplemented by this Amendment, and in case of inconsistency for the Extended Term, the Amendment Rent Schedule shall prevail.

3.3 **Payment Terms – Net 30.**

3.3.1 The Net 30 payment terms set out in **Section 3.4 (Payment Terms (Net 30))** of the Parent Agreement shall apply in full to all Fees, charges, and other amounts payable under this Amendment. For the avoidance of doubt, all invoices issued by Cascade under this Amendment, including invoices for additional Base Rent, Service Charges, Additional Services, utilities, and fit‑out cost recovery, shall be due and payable within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the relevant invoice.

3.3.2 Invoices may, at Cascade’s option, consolidate amounts owing under the Parent Agreement and this Amendment, provided that the invoice reasonably identifies the components and includes separate line items for expansion‑related charges.

3.4 **Late Payment and Remedies.**

3.4.1 The late payment interest provisions in **Section 3.5** of the Parent Agreement shall continue to apply. In addition, given the **High‑Risk Classification**, Cascade shall be entitled, upon written notice and after expiry of the grace period in **Section 3.5.2** of the Parent Agreement, to:

  (a) suspend provision of any non‑critical Additional Services (e.g., project‑based fit‑out, elective after‑hours HVAC) until all undisputed overdue amounts are paid in full; and  

  (b) apply any security deposit or prepaid amounts under the Parent Agreement toward undisputed overdue amounts arising under this Amendment, without prejudice to Cascade’s other rights and remedies.

3.5 **Disputed Amounts.** The dispute mechanism in **Section 3.6** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to invoices relating to this Amendment. Contoso shall continue to pay all undisputed portions in accordance with Net 30, and the Parties shall use good faith efforts to resolve disputes promptly, recognizing the expanded financial exposure under the Amendment Contract Value.

3.6 **Taxes.** The tax provisions in **Section 3.7** of the Parent Agreement shall apply mutatis mutandis to all Fees and amounts payable under this Amendment.

3.7 **Expenses and Reimbursement.** Any out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred by Cascade specifically at Contoso’s request in connection with the Amended Premises (including expedited works, enhanced security for Storage Unit 7-S-12, or additional data cabling) shall be reimbursable under **Section 3.8** of the Parent Agreement, subject to prior written approval, and shall be invoiced with Net 30 terms.

---

## ARTICLE IV – TERM AND TERMINATION (MODIFIED)

4.1 **Revised Term and Expiration Date.**

4.1.1 Notwithstanding **Section 4.1 (Initial Term)** and **Section 1.1.7 (Expiration Date)** of the Parent Agreement, the Parties agree that, with respect to the Amended Premises and related Services under this Amendment, the lease term shall be revised such that the **Expiration Date** is **February 11, 2028** (the **Revised Expiration Date**).

4.1.2 For the avoidance of doubt, the **Commencement Date** of the Parent Agreement (November 02, 2024) remains unchanged. The **Extended Term** applicable to the Amended Premises commences on the Amendment Effective Date and runs through the Revised Expiration Date, unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Amendment and/or the Parent Agreement as modified hereby.

4.2 **Renewal.** The renewal option in **Section 4.2** of the Parent Agreement remains applicable and shall be construed to apply to the Amended Premises. Any renewal shall be documented by a further amendment or new lease, and commercial terms (including rental for the Amended Premises) shall be subject to negotiation based on then prevailing market conditions.

4.3 **Termination for Convenience (Modified – Vendor‑Favorable).**

4.3.1 The **client‑friendly** termination for convenience right granted to Contoso in **Section 4.3 (Termination for Convenience (Client-Friendly))** of the Parent Agreement is hereby **superseded and replaced** for the Extended Term by the following Vendor‑favorable provisions:

  (a) Contoso may terminate this Amendment and the lease of the Amended Premises for convenience only after the first twenty‑four (24) months following the Amendment Effective Date, by providing Cascade with at least **one hundred eighty (180) days’ prior written notice**;  

  (b) Any such termination shall not affect Contoso’s obligations under the Parent Agreement with respect to portions of the Premises not covered by this Amendment, unless expressly stated in the termination notice and agreed in writing by Cascade; and  

  (c) As a condition to termination for convenience, Contoso shall pay to Cascade, in addition to all Rent and charges due up to the effective termination date, an early termination fee equal to **six (6) months’ Base Rent** applicable to the Amended Premises plus the unamortized portion of any fit‑out or capital contributions made by Cascade specifically for the expansion, as set out in the Amendment Rent Schedule.

4.3.2 Cascade’s rights to terminate for convenience as described in **Section 4.3.3** of the Parent Agreement (e.g., redevelopment or major works) shall continue to apply and shall extend to the Amended Premises. Cascade shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide alternative comparable premises on similar terms, but such obligation shall not limit Cascade’s rights to terminate where redevelopment or major works necessitate vacation.

4.4 **Termination for Cause.**

4.4.1 The termination for cause rights in **Section 4.4** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to this Amendment, with the following clarifications:

  (a) Repeated or persistent non‑payment of amounts due specifically in respect of the Amended Premises, or material breaches of security or use restrictions relating to Storage Unit 7-S-12, shall constitute material breaches permitting termination of this Amendment (and, at Cascade’s election, the lease of the Amended Premises) without necessarily terminating the entire Parent Agreement; and  

  (b) A material breach of this Amendment by Contoso which fundamentally undermines Cascade’s ability to manage or lease the Amended Premises may, at Cascade’s option, be treated as a material breach of the Parent Agreement as a whole.

4.4.2 Either Party may terminate this Amendment in accordance with **Section 4.4.3** of the Parent Agreement in the event of insolvency or similar events affecting the other Party.

4.5 **Effect of Termination of Parent Agreement.**

4.5.1 In the event the Parent Agreement is terminated or expires for any reason, this Amendment shall automatically terminate on the same effective date, without the need for further action by the Parties, and the rights and obligations of the Parties with respect to the Amended Premises shall cease, subject to the surviving provisions of this Amendment and the Parent Agreement.

4.5.2 Upon termination or expiration of this Amendment (whether alone or together with the Parent Agreement), Contoso’s restoration and vacation obligations under **Section 4.5.1** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to the Amended Premises. Cascade may, at its sole discretion, require full or partial reinstatement of fit‑out in Suite 26-04 and Storage Unit 7-S-12, with the reasonable costs to be borne by Contoso, subject to fair wear and tear and any works that the Parties agree shall remain.

4.6 **Survival.** The provisions of this Amendment that by their nature should survive termination or expiration (including **Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XIV, XV, XVI** and provisions regarding accrued payment obligations) shall survive in accordance with their terms and in alignment with **Section 16.8** of the Parent Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE V – CONFIDENTIALITY (SUPPLEMENTAL)

5.1 **Reaffirmation of Parent Confidentiality Obligations.** The Parties reaffirm that **Article V (Confidentiality)** of the Parent Agreement remains in full force and effect. The definition of Confidential Information therein is extended to expressly include the existence of this Amendment, its Contract Value, and all pricing, rent, and commercial terms related to the Amended Premises.

5.2 **Disclosure of Amendment Terms.** Neither Party shall disclose the terms of this Amendment to any third party (including other tenants of the building) without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as permitted in **Section 5.3** of the Parent Agreement or as required by law or regulation.

5.3 **Survival Period.** The confidentiality obligations under the Parent Agreement shall continue to apply for the survival period specified in **Section 5.6** of the Parent Agreement (five (5) years following expiration or termination), and shall apply equally to all information and documentation generated pursuant to this Amendment.

## ARTICLE VI – INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (SUPPLEMENTAL)

6.1 **Pre-Existing IP.** The provisions of **Article VI (Intellectual Property Rights)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to any IP created or used in connection with the Amended Premises. Cascade retains ownership of building-related designs, methods, and systems.

6.2 **Fit-Out and Design Deliverables.** To the extent Cascade creates customized fit‑out plans, layouts, or designs specifically for Contoso’s use of Suite 26-04 and Storage Unit 7-S-12 and such work is fully paid for by Contoso, ownership and licensing shall be governed by **Sections 6.2 and 6.3** of the Parent Agreement. Contoso’s rights to use such Deliverables shall be limited to its internal business purposes relating to its occupancy of the Amended Premises and shall terminate upon expiration or termination, except for any perpetual license granted under **Section 6.2.2** of the Parent Agreement.

6.3 **High‑Risk / Vendor‑Favorable Restrictions.** In light of the High‑Risk Classification:

6.3.1 Contoso shall not license, sub‑license, disclose, or provide Cascade’s building-related IP, fit‑out methodologies, or security system configurations to any third party (other than its professional advisers under confidentiality) without Cascade’s prior written consent.

6.3.2 Any reverse engineering or derivative works based on Cascade’s IP are expressly prohibited, except where strictly necessary to meet regulatory or safety obligations and only after prior written notice to Cascade.

8.1 **Continuation of Parent Indemnities.** The mutual indemnification obligations set forth in **Article VIII** of the Parent Agreement remain in full force and effect and apply to all claims arising out of or in connection with the Amended Premises and this Amendment.

8.2 **Vendor‑Favorable Expansion of Client Indemnity.** Without limiting **Section 8.2** of the Parent Agreement, Contoso shall additionally indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Cascade and its Affiliates from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or relating to:

9.2 **No Cap on Liability.** The total aggregate liability of each Party to the other arising out of or in connection with this Amendment, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, shall be **unlimited**. For clarity, there shall be **no monetary cap** on the liability of either Party with respect to this Amendment, and the Parties expressly waive the limitation to three (3) times the total Fees paid as set forth in **Section 9.1** of the Parent Agreement for all matters governed by this Amendment.

9.3 **Consequential and Similar Damages Included.** To reflect the High‑Risk Classification, and notwithstanding **Section 9.2** of the Parent Agreement, the Parties agree that:

  (a) **Neither Party** shall be excluded from liability for indirect, consequential, incidental, special, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with this Amendment; and  

  (b) Loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of business, and loss of goodwill shall be **recoverable** to the extent such losses are reasonably foreseeable or are a natural consequence of the breach or event giving rise to liability under this Amendment.

9.4 **Exceptions and Carve Outs.** The exceptions to limitations in **Section 9.3** of the Parent Agreement remain applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, liabilities relating to indemnification obligations, confidentiality breaches, data protection violations, fraud, and willful misconduct are fully uncapped under this Amendment.

## ARTICLE X – INSURANCE (SUPPLEMENTAL REQUIREMENTS)

10.1 **Additional Insurance by Contoso.** In addition to the insurance coverage required under **Section 10.2** of the Parent Agreement, Contoso shall:

  (a) increase its public liability insurance coverage to a minimum of **SGD 5,000,000** per occurrence for incidents arising out of or in connection with the Amended Premises; and  

  (b) maintain adequate insurance for property, equipment, and records stored in Storage Unit 7-S-12, recognizing that Cascade’s building insurance does not cover Contoso’s movable property or business interruption losses.

10.2 **Certificates of Insurance.** The requirements in **Section 10.3** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to the additional insurance policies mandated by this Amendment. Upon Cascade’s request, Contoso shall provide certificates evidencing compliance with this Article X.

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY (ENHANCED)

11.1 **Continuation of Parent Data Protection Obligations.** **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)** of the Parent Agreement continues to govern the processing of personal data by Cascade on behalf of Contoso, including building access logs and CCTV footage for the Amended Premises.

11.2 **Additional Data Processing.** Cascade may process additional categories of personal data in connection with enhanced security measures for Storage Unit 7-S-12, including advanced access control logs and, where applicable, biometric data, provided that such processing complies with the Singapore PDPA, and, where extraterritorially applicable, GDPR and CCPA. Such data shall be processed strictly in accordance with Contoso’s documented instructions, except where required by law.

11.3 **Data Breach Notification.** The breach notification obligations in **Section 11.4** of the Parent Agreement apply. Given the high‑value nature of the equipment and records that may be stored in Storage Unit 7-S-12, Cascade shall prioritize breaches affecting that location in its internal incident response procedures and shall provide Contoso with enhanced cooperation in any required notifications to data subjects or regulators.

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (AMENDMENT SLA)

12.1 **Supplement to Article XII of Parent Agreement.** The SLA provisions in **Article XII** of the Parent Agreement remain applicable to the Amended Premises. This Article XII of the Amendment introduces additional or refined metrics and remedies specifically applicable to the Amended Premises.

12.2 **Uptime Commitments.**

12.2.1 Cascade shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that essential building systems serving the Amended Premises (including power distribution, HVAC, and access control) are available at least **99.95%** of the time during normal business hours, excluding planned maintenance and Force Majeure Events.

12.2.2 Planned maintenance affecting the Amended Premises shall, where practicable, be scheduled outside normal business hours with at least seven (7) Business Days’ prior notice.

12.3 **Response and Resolution Times.** The response and resolution times set forth in **Section 12.3** of the Parent Agreement apply, with the following modifications for critical incidents affecting the Amended Premises:

  (a) urgent issues involving complete loss of electrical power or access to the Amended Premises shall be acknowledged within **thirty (30) minutes** and targeted for resolution within **two (2) hours**, subject to the nature of the issue; and  

  (b) for any critical incident affecting Storage Unit 7-S-12 where there is a risk of damage to stored equipment or records (e.g., water ingress), Cascade shall dispatch appropriate personnel within **one (1) hour** of notification.

12.4 **SLA Remedies.**

12.4.1 If Cascade fails to achieve the 99.95% uptime commitment for essential systems serving the Amended Premises in any calendar month, Contoso shall be entitled to a service credit equal to a percentage of the monthly Service Charges attributable to the Amended Premises, as set out in the Amendment Rent Schedule.

12.4.2 Service credits under this Amendment shall be in addition to any service credits under the Parent Agreement, provided that total service credits in any calendar month shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the monthly Service Charges attributable to the Amended Premises.

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT (SUPPLEMENTAL)

13.1 **Application of Parent Change Management.** The change management process described in **Article XIII** of the Parent Agreement shall apply equally to any changes in scope, fit‑out, or services relating to the Amended Premises.

13.2 **Amendment-Specific Changes.** Any change that materially affects the Amended Premises (including changes in net lettable area, major reconfigurations, or changes affecting the Amendment Contract Value by more than ten percent (10%)) shall be documented by a written change order signed by both Parties and, where appropriate, treated as a further amendment to this Amendment and referenced under the Parent Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Incorporation of Parent Dispute Resolution.** The dispute resolution mechanisms in **Article XIV** of the Parent Agreement, including negotiation, escalation, optional mediation, and final and binding arbitration under SIAC Rules, shall apply to any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Amendment.

14.2 **Consolidation.** Where a dispute relates to both the Parent Agreement and this Amendment, the Parties agree that such dispute shall be consolidated and resolved in a single proceeding, unless the arbitral tribunal determines that separate proceedings are more appropriate.

---

## ARTICLE XV – FORCE MAJEURE

15.1 **Application of Parent Force Majeure.** The Force Majeure provisions in **Article XV** of the Parent Agreement apply to this Amendment. A Force Majeure Event affecting building systems serving the Amended Premises shall be treated as a Force Majeure Event for purposes of this Amendment and the Parent Agreement.

15.2 **Extended Force Majeure and Options.** If a Force Majeure Event materially affecting the Amended Premises continues for more than ninety (90) consecutive days, either Party may elect to terminate this Amendment with respect only to the Amended Premises upon thirty (30) days’ written notice, without liability except for amounts accrued prior to the effective date of termination, as contemplated in **Section 15.5** of the Parent Agreement.
