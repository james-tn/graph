## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.** The Parties acknowledge and agree that, with respect to the Processing of Personal Data under this Agreement, Contoso acts as Controller (or Business), and Cascade acts as Processor (or Service Provider).

11.2 **Processing Instructions.** Cascade shall Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a Third Country, unless required to do so by applicable law. In such a case, Cascade shall inform Contoso of that legal requirement before Processing, unless the law prohibits such notification.

11.3 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with its respective obligations under applicable Data Protection Laws. Cascade shall notify Contoso without undue delay if it becomes aware that Contoso’s instructions infringe Data Protection Laws, and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to revise such instructions.

11.4 **Security Measures.** Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of Processing, Cascade shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational Security Measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, as appropriate:

  (a) pseudonymization and encryption of Personal Data;  
  (b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems;  
  (c) the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of an incident; and  
  (d) a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.

11.5 **Subprocessing.** Cascade may engage Subprocessors to provide certain Services, provided that:

  (a) Cascade shall maintain a written contract with each Subprocessor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement;  
  (b) Cascade shall remain fully liable to Contoso for the performance of each Subprocessor’s obligations; and  
  (c) where required by law, Cascade shall provide Contoso with notice of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of Subprocessors, thereby giving Contoso the opportunity to object on reasonable grounds. If Contoso objects and the Parties cannot resolve the objection, Contoso may terminate the affected Services with proportional adjustment of Fees.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.** Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Cascade shall assist Contoso, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, in fulfilling Contoso’s obligations to respond to requests from Data Subjects under Data Protection Laws, including requests to access, correct, delete, restrict, or port their Personal Data. Cascade shall promptly forward to Contoso any Data Subject request that it receives directly and shall not respond to such request except on documented instructions from Contoso, unless required by law.

11.7 **Personal Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a Personal Data Breach, Cascade shall:

  (a) notify Contoso without undue delay and, where feasible, within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the breach;  
  (b) provide Contoso with sufficient information to allow Contoso to meet any obligations to notify Data Subjects, regulators, or other parties; and  
  (c) cooperate with Contoso and take such reasonable steps as are necessary to investigate, mitigate, and remediate the Personal Data Breach.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Contoso’s written request, Cascade shall, at Contoso’s choice, delete or return all Personal Data, including any existing copies, unless applicable law requires storage of the Personal Data. Deletion shall be performed in a manner that ensures the Personal Data cannot be reconstructed or read. Cascade may retain anonymized data that does not constitute Personal Data, provided it cannot be used to identify any individual.

11.9 **International Data Transfers.** If Cascade Processes Personal Data originating from the EEA, the UK, or other jurisdictions with cross-border transfer restrictions, and such Processing involves a transfer to a Third Country, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses or other transfer mechanisms approved by relevant authorities, and shall comply with any additional requirements arising under applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.10 **CCPA-Specific Provisions.** Where the CCPA applies:

  (a) Cascade shall not sell or share Personal Data, retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the Services or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA;  
  (b) Cascade shall not combine Personal Data received from Contoso with personal data received from another source, except as permitted by the CCPA; and  
  (c) Cascade certifies that it understands and will comply with the restrictions set forth in this Section 11.10.

11.11 **Audits and Inspections.** Cascade shall make available to Contoso all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this Article XI and shall allow for and contribute to audits and inspections conducted by Contoso or an auditor mandated by Contoso, subject to the following:

  (a) audits shall be limited to once per calendar year unless there is a reasonable suspicion of non-compliance or a Personal Data Breach;  
  (b) audits shall be conducted upon reasonable advance written notice (at least fifteen (15) Business Days) and during normal business hours;  
  (c) any auditor shall be bound by confidentiality obligations reasonably acceptable to Cascade; and  
  (d) Contoso shall bear its own costs and expenses related to the audit, and shall reimburse Cascade for reasonable, documented costs incurred in connection with providing assistance for the audit.

Cascade shall use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule maintenance during off-peak hours and shall provide Contoso with at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior notice of any scheduled maintenance that is expected to result in downtime.

12.3 **Incident Response Times.** Cascade shall respond to reported incidents affecting the Services in accordance with the following guidelines:

  (a) **Priority 1 (Critical)** – complete loss of Service or major security event: initial response within one (1) hour, target resolution or workaround within four (4) hours;  
  (b) **Priority 2 (High)** – significant degradation of Service with substantial impact on operations: initial response within four (4) hours, target resolution within one (1) Business Day;

  (c) Availability < 98.0% in a calendar month: credit equal to 20% of the monthly recurring Fees for affected Services.

Service credits shall be applied to the next invoice and shall constitute Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the uptime commitment, without prejudice to any rights Contoso may have in respect of a material breach under Article IV.

12.5 **Exclusions.** The SLA does not apply to performance issues caused by:

  (a) factors outside Cascade’s reasonable control (including Force Majeure Events);  
  (b) Contoso’s or a third party’s equipment or network;  
  (c) misuse of the Services by Contoso; or  
  (d) scheduled maintenance notified in accordance with Section 12.2.
