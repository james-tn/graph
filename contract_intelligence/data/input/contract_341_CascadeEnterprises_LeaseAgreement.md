## ARTICLE XI  
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** To the extent either Party processes personal data (as defined under applicable Law) in connection with this Agreement, such Party shall comply with all applicable data protection and privacy Laws, including, as applicable, the **General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”)**, the **California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)**, and any similar U.S. federal or state privacy Laws.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.** In general, each Party will be an independent controller of personal data it collects and processes for its own purposes (e.g., HR, marketing). To the extent the Vendor processes personal data on behalf of the Company in providing access control or related Services (e.g., badge access logs associated with identified employees), Vendor will act as a processor/service provider, and Company as controller/business, and the Parties shall enter into any additional data processing agreement or CCPA‑required service provider addendum reasonably requested by Company, which shall be incorporated by reference into this Agreement.

11.3 **Security Measures.** Each Party shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, consistent with industry standards and the sensitivity of the data.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a confirmed data breach involving personal data processed under this Agreement:  
  (a) The Party experiencing the breach shall notify the other Party without undue delay, and in any event within seventy‑two (72) hours of confirming the breach, where feasible;  
  (b) The notification shall include the nature of the breach, categories and approximate number of data subjects and records affected, likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to address the breach; and  
  (c) The Parties shall reasonably cooperate in investigating, mitigating, and remediating the breach, and in complying with any notification or regulatory obligations.

11.5 **Use and Disclosure of Personal Data.** Each Party shall:  
  (a) restrict access to personal data to those personnel who have a legitimate need to know for purposes of performing this Agreement and who are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations;  
  (b) not sell personal data (as “sell” is defined by CCPA) or use it for any purpose not authorized by the other Party or required by Law; and  
  (c) reasonably assist the other Party in responding to data subject requests to exercise rights under applicable Law (e.g., access, deletion), where such requests relate to data processed under this Agreement.

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Each Party shall retain personal data processed under this Agreement only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes of processing and to comply with applicable Law, after which the data shall be deleted or anonymized. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, and subject to **Section 5.6**, each Party shall, upon request, delete or return personal data belonging to the other Party, except to the extent retention is required by Law or necessary for legitimate business purposes (e.g., legal defense).

## ARTICLE XII  
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Uptime and Availability.** The Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that essential Building systems providing access, HVAC, lighting, and elevator services to the Premises are available at least **99.9%** of the time during Business Hours in each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance and Force Majeure Events.

12.2 **Response Times.** The Vendor shall respond to service requests from the Company as follows:  
  (a) **Emergency Issues** (e.g., life‑safety issues, flooding, fire hazards, total power or HVAC failure): Respond promptly and in any event within **one (1) hour** after notice, with continuous efforts until resolved or stabilized.  
  (b) **Urgent Issues** (e.g., partial loss of essential services significantly impacting operations): Respond within **four (4) hours** after notice and use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve within twenty‑four (24) hours.  
  (c) **Routine Issues** (e.g., minor repairs, non‑critical maintenance): Respond within **one (1) Business Day** and use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve within five (5) Business Days.

12.3 **Maintenance Windows.** The Vendor may schedule periodic maintenance of Building systems, typically outside of Business Hours. Vendor shall provide reasonable advance notice to the Company (not less than forty‑eight (48) hours, except in emergencies) of any maintenance likely to materially impact access or essential services to the Premises.

12.4 **SLA Credits and Remedies.**  
  12.4.1 If Vendor fails to meet the Uptime or Response Time commitments in this **Article XII** in a material and repeated manner, the Company shall be entitled to service credits in the form of a reasonable reduction of Base Rent for the affected period, as mutually agreed in good faith, taking into account the severity and duration of the impact.  
  12.4.2 Persistent or material SLA failures, if not cured within a reasonable period after written notice from Company, may constitute a material breach entitling Company to exercise its termination rights under **Section 4.4**.  
  12.4.3 SLA credits shall be the Company’s primary remedy for isolated SLA breaches, without prejudice to the Company’s rights and remedies for any broader Vendor breach of this Agreement.

Change Requests shall be made in writing and shall describe the proposed change, rationale, timing, and any anticipated impact on fees or operational performance.

13.2 **Evaluation.** Upon receipt of a Change Request, the receiving Party shall, within a reasonable time (typically ten (10) Business Days for non‑urgent changes), evaluate the requested change and provide a written response indicating whether the change is feasible and, if so, the estimated impact on:  
  (a) Rent or fees;  
  (b) timelines or schedules; and  
  (c) any other material terms of this Agreement.

Each Change Order shall detail the agreed modifications, including any adjustments to fees, Service Levels, or timelines.

## ARTICLE XIV  
DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good‑Faith Negotiation.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (“Dispute”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through negotiations between senior executives of each Party. Either Party may initiate this process by providing written notice of the Dispute and requesting a meeting. The Parties shall meet (which may be by teleconference or videoconference) within fifteen (15) Business Days of such notice and attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days thereafter.

14.2 **Mediation.** If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation within the time period specified above, the Parties agree to attempt to resolve the Dispute through non‑binding mediation before a mutually agreed mediator located in Delaware. The mediation shall be conducted in accordance with the then‑current commercial mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or other mutually agreed rules. The costs of the mediator shall be shared equally, and each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  
  14.3.1 If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days from the appointment of the mediator, either Party may elect to submit the Dispute to binding arbitration administered by the AAA in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, or, if both Parties agree, the Dispute may be resolved through litigation in the courts specified in **Section 17.8**.  
  14.3.2 Absent mutual agreement to litigate, arbitration shall be held in Wilmington, Delaware, before a single arbitrator experienced in commercial real estate and contract law. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  
  14.3.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent imminent harm, misuse of Confidential Information, or violation of Intellectual Property Rights, without first resorting to mediation or arbitration.

14.4 **Continued Performance.** During the pendency of any Dispute, the Parties shall continue to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement, to the extent reasonably practicable, unless and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

## ARTICLE XV  
FORCE MAJEURE

15.1 **Definition.** A “Force Majeure Event” means any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party that prevents or materially delays performance under this Agreement, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, fire, flood, earthquake, war, terrorism, civil unrest, strikes or other labor disputes (excluding those involving the affected Party’s own workforce to the extent within its control), pandemics, epidemics, governmental orders or restrictions, or failure of third‑party utilities or infrastructure.

15.2 **Notice and Mitigation.** The affected Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing upon becoming aware of a Force Majeure Event, describing the nature of the event, its expected duration, and the anticipated impact on performance.

15.3 **Suspension of Obligations.** To the extent a Force Majeure Event prevents or materially delays a Party’s performance of its obligations (other than payment obligations, which are not excused), such obligations shall be suspended for the duration of the Force Majeure Event and for a reasonable recovery period thereafter, provided the Party complies with **Section 15.2**.

15.4 **Extended Force Majeure.** If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than ninety (90) consecutive days and materially impairs the Company’s ability to occupy and use the Premises, the Company may, at its option and upon written notice to the Vendor, either (a) terminate this Agreement without penalty, effective thirty (30) days after such notice; or (b) negotiate in good faith with Vendor appropriate Rent abatements or other adjustments.
