## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Modification of Liability Regime for This Amendment.**  
Notwithstanding **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)** of the Parent Agreement (which provides for no contractual cap on liability and does not exclude consequential damages), the Parties agree that, solely with respect to claims arising under or in connection with this Amendment:

9.1.1 The aggregate liability of either Party to the other for all claims arising out of or in connection with this Amendment, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall be **capped at two (2) times the total fees paid and payable by the Client to the Vendor under this Amendment during the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.

9.2 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  
Except as set out in **Section 9.3** below and to the extent permitted by applicable law, in relation to this Amendment **only**, neither Party shall be liable to the other for:

(a) loss of profits;  
(b) loss of revenue;  
(c) loss of anticipated savings;  
(d) loss or corruption of data (except to the extent covered under a specific indemnity); or  
(e) any indirect or consequential loss.

This represents a more balanced "Medium" risk allocation for this Amendment than the "High" risk profile of the Parent Agreement.

9.3 **Exceptions.**  
The cap and exclusions in this Article IX shall not apply to:

(a) either Party’s liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence;  
(b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;  
(c) infringement of Intellectual Property Rights as addressed under **Section 6.8** of the Parent Agreement and Article VIII of this Amendment;  
(d) the Client’s payment obligations under this Amendment; or  
(e) any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses it may suffer in connection with any claim or breach under this Amendment, consistent with **Section 9.4** of the Parent Agreement.
