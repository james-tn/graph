Without limiting Section 5.1, the Receiving Party recognizes that some Confidential Information may constitute trade secrets or highly sensitive information, the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of which may cause irreparable harm. The Receiving Party shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect such information, including access controls, encryption (where appropriate), and physical security safeguards.

5.3 **Exceptions.**

The Receiving Party acknowledges that any unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages may be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief and specific performance without the necessity of posting bond.

5.6 **Survival of Confidentiality Obligations.**  
The obligations of confidentiality and non‑use set forth in this Article V shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in respect of each item of Confidential Information for a period of **five (5) years** from the date of disclosure, except that trade secrets shall be maintained in confidence for so long as they remain trade secrets under Applicable Law.

  (d) arising from Contoso’s failure to obtain necessary licenses, consents, or approvals in respect of third‑party systems, data, or content.

8.3 **Procedures for Indemnification.**  

  (a) The Party seeking indemnification (the “Indemnified Party”) shall promptly notify the other Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) in writing of any Claim for which it seeks indemnification, provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations except to the extent it is materially prejudiced thereby.

  (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume control of the defense and settlement of the Claim with counsel of its choice, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any admission of liability, obligation, or restriction on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  (c) The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defense of any Claim and may participate in such defense with counsel of its own choosing at its own cost.

8.4 **Infringement Remedies.**  
If any Deliverable is, or in Zenith’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of an IPR infringement Claim, Zenith may, at its option and expense:

  (a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using the Deliverable;

  (b) modify or replace the Deliverable so that it is non‑infringing while substantially preserving its functionality; or

  (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially practicable, terminate the affected portion of the Services and Deliverables and refund to Contoso any prepaid Fees for the terminated portion, less a reasonable charge for the use of the Deliverable prior to termination.

## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Uncapped Liability – High Risk.**  
The Parties acknowledge that, in view of the High Risk designation, **Zenith shall not be subject to any contractual cap on liability under this Agreement**. Accordingly, the total liability of Zenith to Contoso in respect of any and all Claims, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, shall not be limited by a monetary cap. Contoso acknowledges that this allocation of risk has been reflected in the Fees and the commercial terms.

9.2 **Types of Damages.**  
In light of the High Risk nature, **neither Party excludes consequential, indirect, special, punitive, or exemplary damages** under this Agreement. Each Party may seek recovery for all categories of legally recoverable damages, subject to the other provisions of this Article IX and Applicable Law.

9.3 **Exclusions.**  
Notwithstanding Section 9.2, no Party shall be liable to the other for any Losses arising from:

  (a) the other Party’s misuse of the Services or Deliverables in breach of this Agreement;

  (b) any combination of the Deliverables with third‑party products not supplied or approved by Zenith, where the Loss would not have arisen but for such combination; or

  (c) any modification of the Deliverables by the other Party without Zenith’s prior written consent.

9.4 **Mitigation.**  
Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses it may suffer in connection with this Agreement.
