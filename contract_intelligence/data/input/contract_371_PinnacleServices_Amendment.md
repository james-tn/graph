## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.** For the purposes of Applicable Data Protection Laws, the Parties acknowledge that, in relation to any Personal Data processed by Vendor on behalf of Client in connection with the Services, Client is the “controller” and Vendor is the “processor” (as those terms are defined in Applicable Data Protection Laws).

11.2 **Processing Instructions.** Vendor shall process Personal Data only: (a) on documented instructions from Client (including as set out in this Amendment and applicable SOWs); or (b) as otherwise required by Applicable Law, in which case Vendor shall inform Client of such legal requirement before processing, unless such law prohibits such information.

11.3 **Security Measures.** Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing and the risks to data subjects.

11.4 **Sub-Processors.** Vendor may engage sub-processors to assist in the provision of the Services, provided that: (a) Vendor enters into a written agreement with each sub-processor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set out in this Article XI; and (b) Vendor remains fully liable to Client for the acts and omissions of its sub-processors.

11.5 **International Transfers.** Vendor shall not transfer Personal Data outside the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area (“EEA”) unless it has ensured that an adequate level of protection is in place in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Laws, for example, by implementing appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses or reliance on a UK adequacy decision.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.** Vendor shall, to the extent reasonably possible and at Client’s cost (except where such assistance is required by law to be provided at no charge), assist Client in responding to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws, including rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and objection.

11.7 **Data Breach Notification.**

11.7.1 Vendor shall notify Client without undue delay (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) upon becoming aware of a Data Breach affecting Personal Data processed on behalf of Client.

11.7.2 Such notification shall include, to the extent known at the time, details of the nature of the breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned, the categories and approximate number of Personal Data records concerned, the likely consequences of the breach, and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach.

11.7.3 Vendor shall cooperate with Client and provide reasonable assistance in relation to any notifications to supervisory authorities or data subjects required under Applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Upon termination or expiration of this Amendment, Vendor shall, at Client’s choice, delete or return to Client all Personal Data processed on behalf of Client, and delete existing copies, unless Applicable Law requires storage of the Personal Data. Vendor shall provide written confirmation of deletion upon Client’s request.

11.9 **Audit Rights.** Client (or its appointed independent auditor) shall have the right, upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours, to conduct audits or inspections of Vendor’s data processing facilities and practices to verify compliance with this Article XI. Client shall not exercise this right more than once per year, except in the event of a suspected breach of this Article XI.

11.10 **CCPA and Other Laws.** To the extent Vendor processes Personal Data relating to residents of jurisdictions with additional privacy requirements (e.g., California under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)), Vendor shall comply with such laws as applicable. Vendor shall not sell Personal Data as defined in such laws and shall not use Personal Data for any purpose other than as set out in this Amendment.

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)

12.1 **Availability.** Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the production environment of the solution is available for use by Client at least **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month (“Availability Target”), excluding Scheduled Maintenance and Permitted Downtime.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.** Vendor may carry out scheduled maintenance during mutually agreed maintenance windows, typically outside UK business hours. Vendor shall provide at least five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice of any scheduled maintenance expected to cause service interruption.

12.3 **Incident Management.**

12.3.1 Vendor shall provide a helpdesk available during Business Hours and an on-call service for critical incidents outside Business Hours.

- Priority 2 (High): response within 2 hours; target resolution within 8 hours;  
- Priority 3 (Medium): response within 4 hours; target resolution within 2 Business Days;  
- Priority 4 (Low): response within 1 Business Day; resolution on a best-efforts basis.

- Availability between 99.0% and 99.49%: 10% credit;  
- Availability below 99.0%: 15% credit.

12.5 **Exclusive Remedy.** Service credits shall be Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the Service Levels, except where such failure constitutes a material breach under Article IV or results from Vendor’s gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

12.6 **Reporting.** Vendor shall provide monthly SLA reports showing system availability, incident metrics, and service credit calculations. Client may request additional reporting as reasonably required.

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may request changes to the scope, Deliverables, timelines, Service Levels, or other aspects of the Services by submitting a written Change Request describing the proposed change and the rationale therefor.

13.3 **Approval Process.** No Change Request shall be binding unless and until it is signed by authorised representatives of both Parties. Once signed, the Change Request shall form part of this Amendment and the relevant SOW.

13.4 **Interim Work.** At Client’s written request, Vendor may commence work in accordance with a proposed Change Request before it is formally approved, provided that Client agrees to pay Vendor for such work on a time and materials basis if the Change Request is ultimately not approved. Vendor shall not be obliged to commence such work absent Client’s prior written confirmation.

---

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiation.** In the event of any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this Amendment or the Master Agreement as amended hereby, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute by negotiation between their respective project managers.

14.2 **Escalation.** If the dispute is not resolved within fourteen (14) calendar days, either Party may escalate the dispute to senior executives of the Parties (at least director level or equivalent), who shall seek to resolve the dispute within a further fourteen (14) calendar days.

Unless otherwise agreed, the mediation costs shall be shared equally between the Parties.

14.4 **Jurisdiction and Venue.** Subject to Section 14.3, any dispute not resolved by negotiation or mediation shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales. Nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking urgent injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or stop any actual or threatened breach of confidentiality or infringement of Intellectual Property Rights.

---

## ARTICLE XV – FORCE MAJEURE

15.1 **Force Majeure Events.** Neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Amendment (other than payment obligations) to the extent such failure or delay is caused by a Force Majeure Event, being an event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, civil unrest, strikes or other industrial disputes (other than those involving the workforce of the Party seeking to rely on this clause), epidemics or pandemics, governmental actions, or failures of public telecommunications or utility services.

15.2 **Notice.** The affected Party shall notify the other Party as soon as reasonably practicable upon becoming aware of a Force Majeure Event, providing details of the nature of the event, its expected duration, and the steps being taken to mitigate its impact.
