9.2 **Liability Cap.**

Subject to **Section 9.4**, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any loss of profits, loss of revenue, or loss of goodwill.

9.5 **Allocation of Risk.**  
The Parties acknowledge that the WO Fees reflect the allocation of risk set forth in this **Article IX**, which is more balanced than the uncapped regime in **Article IX** of the Parent SOW, and that they would not have entered into this Work Order without such allocation.
