5.1 **Confidential Information Defined.** For purposes of this Agreement, **“Confidential Information”** means any non-public information disclosed by or on behalf of a Party (the **“Disclosing Party”**) to the other Party (the **“Receiving Party”**), whether orally, visually, in writing, or in any other tangible or intangible form, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information or the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information includes, without limitation, business plans, strategies, financial information, pricing, customer or supplier information, technical data, software, object code, source code, specifications, inventions, know-how, trade secrets, and any analyses, compilations, studies, or other documents prepared by the Receiving Party that contain or reflect such information.  

Client’s Confidential Information includes, without limitation, all Client Materials and any Personal Data provided or made available to Vendor. Vendor’s Confidential Information includes, without limitation, its methodologies, tools, processes, and pricing information.

5.2 **Exclusions.** Confidential Information does not include information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate by competent written evidence: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; (b) was known to the Receiving Party prior to the Disclosing Party’s disclosure; (c) is received by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any obligation of confidentiality; or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, officers, directors, contractors, professional advisors, and Affiliates who have a “need to know” such information for purposes of this Agreement and who are bound by obligations of confidentiality no less protective than those set forth herein. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Article V by its representatives.

5.4 **Compelled Disclosure.** If the Receiving Party is required by law, regulation, or court order to disclose any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall (to the extent legally permitted) promptly notify the Disclosing Party in writing and cooperate with the Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Party’s expense, in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy.

5.7 **Survival.** The obligations set forth in this Article V shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of **five (5) years** after the expiration or termination of this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any trade secrets and Personal Data, such obligations shall continue for so long as such information remains a trade secret or Personal Data under applicable law.

(a) **Commercial General Liability Insurance** with limits of not less than US$1,000,000 per occurrence and US$2,000,000 in the aggregate, covering bodily injury, property damage, personal injury, and contractual liability;  

(b) **Professional Liability / Errors and Omissions Insurance** with limits of not less than US$2,000,000 per claim and in the aggregate, covering liability arising from professional services and failure of the Deliverables;

10.2 **Certificates of Insurance.** Upon Client’s request, Vendor shall provide Client with certificates of insurance evidencing the required coverage and shall provide prompt written notice of any cancellation or material change in such coverage. Vendor shall name Client as an additional insured under Vendor’s Commercial General Liability and Professional Liability policies, to the extent commercially reasonable and permitted by Vendor’s insurer.

10.3 **No Limitation of Liability.** Vendor’s maintenance of insurance shall not limit or otherwise affect Vendor’s obligations or liability under this Agreement, except to the extent expressly stated herein.

## ARTICLE XI. DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its performance under this Agreement. To the extent Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of Client, Vendor shall be deemed a “processor” or “service provider,” and Client shall be deemed a “controller” or “business,” as such terms are defined in applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.** Vendor shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Client, including as set forth in this Agreement and any SOW, and solely for the purposes of performing the Services and delivering the Deliverables. Vendor shall not: (a) sell or share Personal Data; (b) retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any purpose other than to provide the Services; or (c) retain, use, or disclose Personal Data outside of the direct business relationship between Vendor and Client, in each case consistent with CCPA and similar laws.

11.3 **Security Measures.** Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures shall be appropriate to the nature of the Personal Data and the risks of processing and shall include at a minimum: access controls, encryption in transit (and at rest where reasonable), regular vulnerability management, incident detection and response processes, and personnel training on data protection.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Vendor may engage subcontractors (subprocessors) to process Personal Data, provided that Vendor: (a) enters into a written agreement with each subprocessor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those provided in this Article XI; and (b) remains fully liable for the acts and omissions of such subprocessors. Vendor shall maintain a list of subprocessors involved in processing Personal Data and shall make such list available to Client upon request.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.** Vendor shall notify Client without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours, after becoming aware of any unauthorized access to, acquisition of, or disclosure of Personal Data processed under this Agreement (a **“Data Breach”**). Such notice shall describe, to the extent known: (a) the nature of the Data Breach; (b) the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records concerned; (c) the likely consequences; and (d) the measures taken or proposed to address and mitigate the Data Breach. Vendor shall cooperate with Client in investigating the Data Breach, fulfilling any legal notification or reporting obligations, and remediating the incident.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.** Vendor shall provide reasonable assistance to Client, at Client’s cost (unless required by applicable law), in responding to requests from individuals to exercise their rights under applicable Data Protection Laws (such as rights of access, rectification, deletion, restriction, and portability), to the extent such requests relate to Personal Data processed by Vendor on behalf of Client.

11.7 **Data Transfers.** To the extent any Personal Data originates from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions restricting cross-border transfers, the Parties shall ensure that any transfer of Personal Data outside such jurisdictions is subject to appropriate safeguards as required by applicable Data Protection Laws, such as standard contractual clauses or an adequacy decision.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by applicable law. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall, at Client’s election, return or securely delete all Personal Data in its possession or control, except to the extent retention is required by applicable law. Any retained Personal Data shall remain subject to the obligations in this Article XI.

## ARTICLE XII. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Uptime Commitment.** Where Vendor provides managed services or hosting services under a SOW, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the applicable systems and services are available at least **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month (the **“Uptime Commitment”**), excluding Permitted Downtime. **“Permitted Downtime”** includes: (a) scheduled maintenance (with at least seventy-two (72) hours’ prior notice to Client and occurring during agreed maintenance windows); (b) emergency maintenance required to address critical security or availability issues (with notice as soon as practicable); and (c) unavailability caused by Client systems, third-party providers, or Force Majeure Events.

12.2 **Response and Resolution Times.** Vendor shall respond to and seek to resolve incidents in accordance with the following target Service Levels (unless otherwise specified in a SOW):

- **Priority 1 (Critical):** Complete loss of service or severe impact on critical operations.  
  - Initial response: within 1 hour (24x7).  
  - Target resolution or workaround: within 8 hours.  

- **Priority 2 (High):** Significant degradation of service with substantial impact on operations but workaround available.  
  - Initial response: within 4 hours during Business Days.  
  - Target resolution or workaround: within 2 Business Days.  

- **Priority 3 (Medium):** Moderate impact issues; non-critical functionality impaired.  
  - Initial response: within 1 Business Day.  
  - Target resolution or workaround: within 5 Business Days.  

- **Priority 4 (Low):** Minor issues; cosmetic defects or general inquiries.  
  - Initial response: within 2 Business Days.  
  - Target resolution: in next scheduled release or as mutually agreed.

12.3 **Service Level Credits.** If Vendor fails to achieve the Uptime Commitment for any calendar month (excluding Permitted Downtime), Client shall be entitled to a service credit as follows (client-friendly):

- Uptime ≥ 99.0% but < 99.9%: service credit equal to 5% of the monthly Fees for the affected service.  
- Uptime ≥ 97.0% but < 99.0%: service credit equal to 10% of the monthly Fees for the affected service.  
- Uptime < 97.0%: service credit equal to 20% of the monthly Fees for the affected service.

Service credits shall be applied against the next invoice(s) issued by Vendor. Service credits shall not, in and of themselves, preclude Client from exercising other rights and remedies under this Agreement, provided that total credits and damages remain subject to the limitations in Article IX.

12.4 **Exclusions.** Service Levels shall not apply to any unavailability or performance issues: (a) caused by factors outside Vendor’s reasonable control (including Force Majeure Events); (b) resulting from Client’s equipment, software, or network; (c) resulting from Client’s or a third party’s misuse or improper use of the services; or (d) resulting from scheduled or emergency maintenance.

12.5 **Reporting and Measurement.** Uptime and Service Levels shall be measured using Vendor’s standard monitoring tools and logs, which shall be made reasonably available to Client upon request. Any disputes regarding Service Level compliance shall be addressed through the dispute resolution process in Article XIV.

12.6 **Exclusive SLA Remedy.** Service credits granted under this Article XII shall be Client’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for any failure by Vendor to meet the Service Levels; provided, however, that persistent or material Service Level failures may constitute a material breach for purposes of termination under Section 4.4.

## ARTICLE XIII. CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may request changes to the scope, specifications, Deliverables, timelines, or other aspects of the Services under an SOW (a **“Change Request”**). Change Requests shall be made in writing and shall describe the proposed change in reasonable detail, including any anticipated impact on scope, schedule, and Fees.

13.2 **Evaluation of Change Requests.** Upon receipt of a Change Request, the receiving Party shall promptly review and consider the requested change. If Client initiates a Change Request, Vendor shall, within a reasonable period, provide Client with a written impact assessment describing: (a) changes to the scope of work; (b) any adjustments to timelines or milestones; (c) any adjustments to Fees or expenses; and (d) any other relevant implications.

13.3 **Change Orders.** No Change Request shall be effective unless and until the Parties agree in writing to a formal change order or amendment (a **“Change Order”**) that references the applicable SOW and sets forth the agreed changes. Once executed, a Change Order shall form part of the applicable SOW and shall be governed by this Agreement.

13.4 **Effect on Performance.** Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Vendor shall not be required to implement any requested change until the Parties have executed a Change Order. Vendor shall continue to perform the Services in accordance with the existing SOW pending execution of a Change Order, unless Client directs Vendor in writing to suspend or modify performance, in which case Client shall be responsible for any resulting costs.

13.5 **Emergency Changes.** For urgent issues requiring immediate action to prevent or address significant service disruption or security risk, Vendor may implement temporary changes without prior written Change Order, provided that Vendor: (a) uses reasonable efforts to minimize impacts; and (b) promptly notifies Client and documents the change, and the Parties subsequently agree on any necessary Change Order to memorialize the change.

---

## ARTICLE XIV. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute through informal negotiations between the Parties’ project managers. If the dispute is not resolved within ten (10) Business Days, either Party may escalate the dispute to senior management by providing written notice. Senior representatives of each Party shall meet (in person or by video/teleconference) within ten (10) Business Days after such escalation to attempt to resolve the dispute.

14.2 **Mediation.** If the dispute is not resolved through negotiation and escalation within thirty (30) days after escalation to senior management, the Parties agree to attempt to resolve the dispute through non-binding mediation before a neutral mediator mutually selected by the Parties. The mediation shall be conducted in Dallas, Texas (unless otherwise agreed), and the Parties shall share the mediator’s fees and expenses equally. Each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs.

14.3 **Litigation; Venue.** If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute through mediation within sixty (60) days from the commencement of mediation, either Party may pursue any remedies available at law or in equity. The Parties agree that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in **Dallas County, Texas**, and each Party hereby consents to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

14.4 **Interim Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek interim or provisional relief (such as a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction) from any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights, without first complying with the negotiation and mediation requirements of this Article XIV.

14.5 **Attorneys’ Fees.** In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs from the non-prevailing Party, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.

## ARTICLE XV. FORCE MAJEURE

15.1 **Definition of Force Majeure.** A **“Force Majeure Event”** means any event or circumstance beyond a Party’s reasonable control that prevents or delays performance under this Agreement, including, but not limited to: acts of God, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics, acts of war, terrorism, civil unrest, government actions or restrictions, strikes or labor disputes (excluding those involving the affected Party’s own employees), failures or interruptions of utilities or telecommunications, or widespread Internet or cloud service disruptions.

15.2 **Notice and Mitigation.** The affected Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of the Force Majeure Event, describing its nature, anticipated duration, and the obligations affected. The affected Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the Force Majeure Event and resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable.

15.3 **Suspension of Obligations.** The obligations of the affected Party shall be suspended to the extent and for the duration of the Force Majeure Event. The corresponding obligations of the other Party shall be suspended to the same extent. Payment obligations for Services already performed or Deliverables already delivered shall not be excused by Force Majeure.

15.4 **Extended Force Majeure.** If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and materially affects performance of a material portion of the Services, either Party may terminate the affected SOW or this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, without liability (other than payment obligations accrued through the effective date of termination).
