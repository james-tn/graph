## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Role of the Parties.**  
For purposes of Data Protection Laws, the Company acts as Controller and Vendor acts as Processor (and service provider/contractor under CCPA), except where Vendor acts as an independent controller under applicable law, in which case the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to allocate responsibilities accordingly.

11.2 **Instructions.**  
Vendor shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from the Company, unless required to do so by applicable law. In such case, Vendor shall inform the Company of that legal requirement before processing, unless the law prohibits such notification.

11.3 **Compliance with Laws.**  
Vendor shall comply with all Data Protection Laws applicable to its provision of the Services and shall not knowingly take any action that would cause the Company to violate Data Protection Laws.

11.4 **Security Measures.**  
Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, as appropriate:

  (a) pseudonymization and encryption of Personal Data;  
  (b) the ability to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of systems;  
  (c) the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and  
  (d) a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of processing.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a Personal Data Breach, Vendor shall:

  (a) notify the Company without undue delay and, in any event, no later than seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the breach;  
  (b) provide the Company with detailed information regarding the nature of the breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records affected, and the likely consequences of the breach;  
  (c) cooperate with the Company and provide assistance as reasonably requested to investigate, contain, and remediate the breach, and to comply with any legal or regulatory obligations regarding notification to data subjects or authorities; and  
  (d) not make or permit any public statement concerning the breach without the Company’s prior written approval, unless required by law.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.**  
Vendor shall, to the extent reasonably possible and at the Company’s cost (if excessive or beyond ordinary support), assist the Company in responding to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws, including rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and objection. Vendor shall promptly notify the Company if it receives a request directly from a data subject and shall not respond except as directed by the Company.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services and in accordance with the Company’s documented retention policies or instructions. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or upon the Company’s earlier request, Vendor shall return or delete Personal Data in accordance with Section 4.6(c). Vendor may retain copies to the extent required by law, provided that any retained Personal Data remains subject to the protections of this Agreement.

11.8 **International Transfers.**  
If Vendor or its Sub-processors process Personal Data outside of the jurisdiction in which it was originally collected, Vendor shall ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to permit such transfers under Data Protection Laws, which may include standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, or other approved transfer mechanisms.

11.9 **CCPA-Specific Provisions.**  
Vendor certifies that it understands and shall comply with the restrictions set forth in CCPA and that it shall not:

  (a) sell or share (as those terms are defined in CCPA) the Personal Data it processes on behalf of the Company;  
  (b) retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any purpose other than the specific purpose of providing the Services or as otherwise permitted under CCPA; or  
  (c) combine Personal Data with other personal information except as necessary to perform the Services or to detect security incidents, protect against fraudulent or illegal activity, or comply with law.

11.10 **Audits and Inspections.**  
Upon reasonable prior written notice and no more than once per contract year, the Company or its designated auditor (which shall not be a competitor of Vendor) may audit Vendor’s compliance with this Article XI. Vendor may satisfy such audit obligations by providing an independent third-party audit report (e.g., SOC 2 Type II or ISO 27001 certification) not older than twelve (12) months. Any on-site audit shall be conducted during normal business hours, without unreasonably interfering with Vendor’s operations, and subject to reasonable confidentiality and security obligations.

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Availability.**  
Vendor shall make the Platform available to the Company with a minimum **monthly uptime of 99.9%**, excluding scheduled maintenance and force majeure events. Uptime shall be calculated as:

> (Total minutes in a calendar month – Unscheduled Downtime) / Total minutes in a calendar month × 100.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.**

  (a) Vendor provides the Company with at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior notice of scheduled maintenance that is expected to cause downtime; and

  (b) **Priority 2 (High)** – Major functionality impaired; initial response within four (4) hours and commercially reasonable efforts towards resolution within twenty-four (24) hours;  
  (c) **Priority 3 (Medium)** – Non-critical issues with moderate impact; initial response within one (1) Business Day and reasonable efforts towards resolution;  
  (d) **Priority 4 (Low)** – Minor issues or general queries; initial response within two (2) Business Days.

12.4 **Service Credits.**  
If Vendor fails to meet the uptime commitment in Section 12.1, the Company shall be entitled to service credits as follows (to be applied against future subscription fees):

  (a) Uptime 99.0% to < 99.9%: 5% of the monthly subscription fee;  
  (b) Uptime 98.0% to < 99.0%: 10% of the monthly subscription fee;  
  (c) Uptime < 98.0%: 20% of the monthly subscription fee.

Service credits shall be the Company’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for SLA failures, without prejudice to the Company’s rights to terminate for material breaches under Article IV.

Vendor shall provide, upon request, monthly or quarterly service reports summarizing uptime performance, incidents, and service credit calculations.
