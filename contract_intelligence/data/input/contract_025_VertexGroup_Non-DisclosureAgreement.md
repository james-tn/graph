  2.4.1 Vendor shall perform the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner, in accordance with generally accepted industry standards for providers of similar services, and in substantial conformity with the specifications and requirements set forth in this Agreement and the applicable SOW.

  2.4.2 Vendor does not warrant that the Services or Deliverables will be error‑free or will meet Client’s specific requirements or expectations, except as expressly set forth herein. Client acknowledges that complex technology projects inherently involve risk, and Vendor’s obligations are limited to those expressly described in this Agreement and the applicable SOW.

  2.4.3 Client shall be responsible for defining its business requirements and for ensuring that the scope of the Services and Deliverables described in each SOW adequately addresses such requirements. Vendor shall not be responsible for any deficiencies resulting from Client’s failure to provide complete, accurate, and timely requirements, data, and assumptions.

2.5 **Client Responsibilities.** Client acknowledges that Vendor’s ability to perform the Services in a timely and effective manner is dependent upon Client’s full and timely cooperation and the accuracy of information provided by Client. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Client shall:

  2.5.1 Provide Vendor with access to Client’s personnel, systems, premises, data, and other resources as reasonably necessary for Vendor to perform the Services;

  2.5.2 Designate one or more qualified individuals to act as Client’s primary point(s) of contact and decision‑makers for the project;

  2.5.3 Provide timely feedback, reviews, and approvals of Deliverables and other project outputs, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed;

  2.6.2 If either Party becomes aware of any event that is reasonably likely to cause a material delay in the performance of the Services or delivery of a Deliverable, such Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing, describing the nature of the delay, the anticipated impact, and proposed mitigation steps.

2.7 **Acceptance of Deliverables.**  

  2.7.1 Unless otherwise set forth in an SOW, Client shall have ten (10) Business Days following delivery of a Deliverable (the **“Review Period”**) to review such Deliverable and either (a) provide written acceptance, or (b) provide written notice of material nonconformities to the applicable specifications.

  2.7.2 If Client fails to provide such notice within the Review Period, the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted as of the last day of the Review Period.

  2.7.3 If Client timely notifies Vendor of material nonconformities, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct such nonconformities and re‑deliver the corrected Deliverable. Client shall then have a further Review Period to evaluate the corrected Deliverable. This process shall repeat until acceptance, provided that if Client uses a Deliverable in production operations, such use shall constitute acceptance.

2.8 **Subcontractors.** Vendor may, in its sole discretion, use subcontractors or other third‑party service providers to perform portions of the Services, provided that Vendor shall remain responsible for the performance of such subcontractors in accordance with this Agreement. Vendor shall ensure that any such subcontractors are bound by confidentiality and data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth herein.
