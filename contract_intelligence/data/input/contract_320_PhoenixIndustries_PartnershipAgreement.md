9.3 **Exceptions and Clarifications.**  
Notwithstanding Section 9.2, the Parties agree that:

  9.3.1 nothing in this Agreement shall limit a Party’s liability for death or personal injury caused by its gross negligence or willful misconduct, or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;  
  9.3.2 the absence of a liability cap and the inclusion of consequential damages under this Article IX have been specifically negotiated and reflected in the Fees and other commercial terms; and  
  9.3.3 each Party shall have a duty to mitigate its damages to the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances.
