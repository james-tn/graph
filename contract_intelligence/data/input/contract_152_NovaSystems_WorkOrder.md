## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Medium Risk Allocation; Relationship to Parent SOW and Consulting Agreement.**

The Parties acknowledge that **Article IX of the Consulting Agreement** provides for no contractual cap on liability, and that **Article IX of the Parent SOW** establishes a client‑friendly liability cap and exclusions for the Low Risk designation of the Parent SOW. For this Work Order, designated **Medium Risk**, the Parties agree to a balanced allocation of risk as set forth below.

9.2 **Liability Cap.**

Except as set forth in Section 9.4 below, the total aggregate liability of each Party arising out of or relating to this Work Order, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, shall not exceed **two (2) times the total WO Fees actually paid or payable by Client to Vendor under this Work Order during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.

9.3 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**

Except as set forth in Section 9.4 below, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other for any indirect, consequential, incidental, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, or data, whether based on contract, tort, or any other legal theory, even if advised of the possibility of such damages and even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose.
