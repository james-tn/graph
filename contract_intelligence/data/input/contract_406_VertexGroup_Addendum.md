## ARTICLE III  
## FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Addendum Contract Value.**  

(a) The Parties acknowledge that the estimated total contract value associated with the Amended Premises and the Extended Term under this Addendum is **US $4,122,543** (the “**Addendum Contract Value**”).  

(b) The Addendum Contract Value includes:  
  (i) New Base Rent for the Amended Premises;  
  (ii) Additional Rent and operating expense pass-throughs attributable to the Amended Premises;  
  (iii) Service Fees for Upgraded Services, if any; and  
  (iv) Tenant Improvement recovery and related charges as expressly provided in this Addendum.  

(c) The Addendum Contract Value is an estimate and may be subject to upward or downward adjustments consistent with the mechanisms for operating expense reconciliation, Change Requests, and Service Fee adjustments in **Sections 3.3, 3.8, and Article XIII** of the Parent Agreement, as supplemented herein.

3.2 **New Base Rent.**  

(a) **Supersession of Prior Base Rent Schedule.** As of the later of (i) the Addendum Effective Date or (ii) the date on which the Additional Premises is delivered to Contoso with Phase I Works substantially completed (the “New Rent Commencement Date”), the Base Rent obligations under **Section 3.2(a)** of the Parent Agreement shall be superseded and replaced for all subsequent months by the New Base Rent schedule in this Section 3.2.  

(b) **New Base Rent Schedule (Amended Premises).** Contoso shall pay Vertex monthly New Base Rent for the Amended Premises as follows (subject to proration as in Section 3.2(b) of the Parent Agreement):  

- Period 1: From the New Rent Commencement Date through **February 25, 2027**:  
  **US $42,000 per month**  

- Period 2: From **February 26, 2027** through **February 25, 2028**:  
  **US $43,500 per month**  

- Period 3: From **February 26, 2028** through **February 25, 2029**:  
  **US $45,000 per month**  

- Period 4: From **February 26, 2029** through the **Addendum Expiration Date (December 08, 2029)**:  
  **US $46,250 per month**, prorated for any partial months in accordance with **Section 3.2(b)** of the Parent Agreement (based on a 30‑day month).  

(c) **Rent During Transition Period.** If, during the Transition Period, portions of the Additional Premises are not yet usable due to incomplete Phase I Works, the Parties shall reasonably and in good faith agree upon an abatement or partial reduction of New Base Rent proportionate to the unavailable square footage, consistent with the risk allocation and fairness principles in **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)** of the Parent Agreement.  

(d) **No Double Rent.** For the avoidance of doubt, upon commencement of New Base Rent for the Amended Premises, Contoso shall not be required to pay separate Base Rent for the original Premises under the old schedule; the New Base Rent replaces and consolidates all Base Rent for both Suite 700 and Suite 800.  

(e) **Preservation of Prior Rent Obligations.** Any Base Rent amounts that accrued prior to the New Rent Commencement Date under the original schedule in **Section 3.2(a)** of the Parent Agreement remain due and payable and are not retroactively affected by this Addendum.

3.3 **Additional Rent and Service Fees.**  

(a) **Operating Expenses.** Consistent with **Section 3.3(a)** of the Parent Agreement, Contoso shall pay Additional Rent representing its proportionate share of Building operating expenses. From and after the New Rent Commencement Date, Contoso’s proportionate share shall be recalculated based on the total rentable square footage of the Amended Premises (approximately 16,500 RSF) relative to the Building, as determined by Vertex in accordance with its standard methodology and documented upon request.  

(b) **Service Fees and Upgraded Services.**  
  (i) Any optional or incremental service fees (e.g., after-hours HVAC, dedicated bandwidth upgrades, incremental security coverage) requested by Contoso in connection with the Amended Premises shall be charged as Service Fees at rates mutually agreed in writing.  
  (ii) If Contoso requests Upgraded Services, the Parties shall execute a written Change Request or exhibit specifying the scope, fees, and Service Levels, which shall be incorporated into this Addendum and the Parent Agreement under **Article XIII**.  

(c) **Estimates and Reconciliation.** Additional Rent and Service Fees that are estimated and billed monthly in advance shall be subject to annual reconciliation, consistent with **Section 3.3(a)** of the Parent Agreement. Overpayments or underpayments shall be credited or invoiced accordingly, with appropriate supporting documentation.

3.4 **Tenant Improvement Costs; Amortization.**  

(a) **Landlord-Funded Improvements.** Vertex shall fund the Phase I Works and Phase II Works as Landlord-funded Tenant Improvements up to an agreed allowance (the “TI Allowance”). To the extent the cost of such Works exceeds the TI Allowance due to Contoso-initiated changes or upgrades, such excess shall be reimbursed by Contoso, either as a lump sum within forty-five (45) days of invoice or amortized as additional monthly charges over the remainder of the Term, as the Parties may mutually agree in writing.  

(b) **Termination Impact.** The Parties reaffirm **Section 4.3 (Termination for Convenience)** of the Parent Agreement, which provides that in the case of termination by Contoso for convenience, Contoso may be required to reimburse any unamortized, Landlord-funded Tenant Improvements if expressly stated in an exhibit. For purposes of this Addendum, any such unamortized amounts related to the Phase I Works and Phase II Works shall be recoverable by Vertex if the Addendum is terminated for Contoso’s convenience prior to the end of the Extended Term, in accordance with a straight-line amortization schedule mutually agreed in writing.

3.5 **Payment Terms; Net 45.**  

(a) **Invoices.** Vertex shall invoice Contoso monthly in advance for New Base Rent, estimated Additional Rent, and any recurring Service Fees, and in arrears for any usage-based or one-time charges (e.g., certain Upgraded Services, excess TI costs).  

(b) **Payment Period.** Notwithstanding **Section 3.4(b) (Payment Period; Net 60)** of the Parent Agreement, the Parties hereby agree that all undisputed amounts due under this Addendum and the Parent Agreement after the Addendum Effective Date shall be payable by Contoso within **forty-five (45) days** of the date of the invoice (“**Net 45**”). This is a negotiated modification reflecting the expanded scope and Medium risk profile.  

(c) **Disputed Amounts.** Contoso may withhold payment of any invoiced amounts that it reasonably and in good faith disputes, provided it complies with the procedures in **Section 3.4(c)** of the Parent Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that any references therein to “Net 60” shall be deemed to refer to “Net 45” for purposes of this Addendum.

3.6 **Late Payment; Interest.** **Section 3.5 (Late Payment; Interest)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to this Addendum, such that any undisputed amounts not paid by the Net 45 due date shall accrue interest from the due date until paid at the lesser of (a) 1.5% per month or (b) the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law, following written notice of late payment from Vertex.

3.7 **Taxes.** The tax obligations set forth in **Section 3.7 (Taxes)** of the Parent Agreement (including Rent-related taxes and withholding obligations) apply equally to payments made under this Addendum. Any sales, use, or similar taxes on the additional Rent or Services under this Addendum shall be borne by Contoso, except for taxes based on Vertex’s net income.

3.8 **Expenses and Reimbursement.**  

(a) Vertex shall bear its internal costs except as expressly provided, consistent with **Section 3.8(a)** of the Parent Agreement.  

(b) Contoso shall reimburse Vertex for pre-approved, out-of-pocket expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred in connection with the Phase I and Phase II Works, or other extraordinary services requested by Contoso, in accordance with **Section 3.8(b)** of the Parent Agreement and this Addendum.

4.2 **Early Access; Commencement of Obligations.**  

(a) **Access Prior to New Rent Commencement Date.** If Vertex provides early access to the Additional Premises prior to the New Rent Commencement Date solely for Contoso’s fit-out or IT installation (without general business occupancy), such early access shall not, by itself, accelerate the New Rent Commencement Date, provided Contoso does not delay Phase I Works.  

(b) **Obligations During Extended Term.** All provisions of the Parent Agreement, as amended herein, shall apply through the end of the Extended Term with respect to the Amended Premises.

4.3 **Termination for Convenience.**

(b) **Contoso’s Obligations on Convenience Termination.** In addition to payment of Rent and charges accruing through the effective date of termination, and consistent with the mechanism referenced in Section 3.4(b) of this Addendum, Contoso shall reimburse Vertex for any unamortized portion of Landlord-funded Tenant Improvements that the Parties have expressly agreed are subject to recovery, as specified in a TI schedule attached as an exhibit to this Addendum. No separate early termination penalty shall apply.  

(c) **Partial Termination for Reduced Premises.** The Parties may, by mutual written agreement, permit Contoso to terminate with respect to only a portion of the Amended Premises (e.g., surrender of Suite 700 while retaining Suite 800), in which case Base Rent and Additional Rent shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the reduced square footage.

4.4 **Termination for Cause.**  

The termination for cause provisions in **Section 4.4 (Termination for Cause)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply in full to this Addendum and the Amended Premises, including payment defaults, material breaches, and insolvency events. Any breach of this Addendum shall be deemed a breach of the Parent Agreement and vice versa, where such breach materially affects the Parties’ rights and obligations under both documents.

4.5 **Effect of Termination or Expiration.**  

Upon expiration or earlier termination of the Parent Agreement and this Addendum:

(a) **Surrender of Amended Premises.** Contoso shall surrender the Amended Premises to Vertex in substantially the same condition as received, reasonable wear and tear, casualty, and approved alterations excepted, consistent with **Section 4.5(a)** of the Parent Agreement.  

(b) **Removal of Property.** Contoso shall remove its personal property and trade fixtures from both Suite 700 and Suite 800, repairing any material damage caused by such removal, as set forth in **Section 4.5(a)**.  

(c) **Final Accounting.** Vertex shall provide a final invoice and reconciliation of all amounts due, including any reconciled Additional Rent, within sixty (60) days following the effective date of termination, as described in **Section 4.5(c)** of the Parent Agreement. Notwithstanding the Net 45 payment terms in Section 3.5 of this Addendum, the Parties agree that Contoso shall pay all undisputed amounts from the final invoice within **forty-five (45) days** of such invoice.  

(d) **Survival.** All provisions of the Parent Agreement and this Addendum that by their nature should survive termination, including but not limited to payment obligations accrued prior to termination, confidentiality, indemnification, limitation of liability, dispute resolution, and governing law, shall so survive, consistent with **Section 4.5(d)** and **Section 16.11** of the Parent Agreement.

4.6 **Effect of Parent Agreement Termination on Addendum.**  

In the event the Parent Agreement is terminated or expires for any reason, this Addendum shall automatically terminate concurrently, unless the Parties expressly agree in writing to maintain certain obligations hereunder (e.g., reimbursement obligations, confidentiality, indemnification) beyond such termination or to restate this Addendum as a standalone lease.
