## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Allocation of Risk / High Risk Profile.**  

9.1.1 In recognition of the **High** risk designation of this Addendum and the nature of the Additional Modules (including AI and mobile capabilities), the Parties acknowledge that the risk allocation under this Article IX differs from **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement.

9.2 **Liability Cap – Addendum.**

9.2.1 For clarity, **there shall be no separate or lower cap on Vendor’s or Client’s aggregate liability under this Addendum** beyond any cap that may apply under **Section 9.2** of the Parent Agreement. To the extent **Section 9.2** of the Parent Agreement is interpreted to limit liability to two (2) times the Fees paid or payable during the preceding twelve (12) months, the Parties agree that, for Addendum-related claims, the calculation of such Fees shall include all Fees paid or payable under this Addendum during such period, in addition to Fees under the Parent Agreement.

9.2.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, **the Parties expressly agree that Client’s payment obligations and indemnification obligations under this Addendum are not subject to any cap**, and Vendor’s liability for its indemnification obligations under **Section 8.1** of the Parent Agreement and **Section 8.1** of this Addendum shall be as stated in the Parent Agreement.

9.3 **Consequential and Other Damages.**

9.3.1 In deviation from **Section 9.1** of the Parent Agreement and in light of the High risk profile, the Parties agree that **neither Party shall be excluded from liability for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, punitive, or similar damages to the extent such damages are actually awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with a claim arising directly from (a) a Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (b) a data breach resulting from a Party’s material failure to comply with Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy) of the Parent Agreement or this Addendum.**

9.3.2 For all other claims not falling within the exceptions above, the exclusions in **Section 9.1** of the Parent Agreement shall continue to apply.

9.4 **Basis of the Bargain.** The Parties acknowledge that the modified risk allocation in this Article IX has been specifically negotiated as part of the pricing and other terms of this Addendum and reflects the high-risk nature of the Additional Modules and related Services.

## ARTICLE X – INSURANCE

10.1 **Vendor Insurance.** Vendor shall maintain the insurance coverages set forth in **Article X** of the Parent Agreement, including Commercial General Liability, Professional Liability / Errors and Omissions, Cyber Liability / Data Breach, Workers’ Compensation, and Employer’s Liability.

10.2 **Certificates of Insurance.** Upon Client’s reasonable request, Vendor shall provide current Certificates of Insurance evidencing the coverages required under the Parent Agreement and this Addendum, consistent with **Section 10.2** of the Parent Agreement.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of any Data Breach (as defined in **Section 11.6** of the Parent Agreement) involving data processed by the Additional Modules, Vendor shall follow the notification procedures and timelines set forth in **Section 11.6** of the Parent Agreement.

11.5 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Upon expiration or termination of this Addendum, Vendor shall, at Client’s written direction, return or delete Client Data processed specifically for the Additional Modules, subject to the retention and deletion principles in **Section 11.5** of the Parent Agreement.
