2.1.1 The Parties acknowledge and agree that **Article II (Scope of Premises and Services)** of the Lease Agreement defines the Premises as consisting of approximately **45,000 rentable square feet** on portions of the 20th, 21st, and 22nd floors of the Building, as generally depicted in **Exhibit A (Premises Description and Floor Plan)** to the Lease Agreement.

2.1.2 Effective as of the Addendum Effective Date, the definition of “Premises” in **Section 1.1.19** of the Lease Agreement and the description set forth in **Section 2.1** of the Lease Agreement are hereby amended and expanded solely with respect to Contoso’s rights and obligations under the Lease Agreement so that the Premises hereafter include both the Existing Premises and the Expansion Premises, collectively the **Combined Premises**, as described in this Addendum.

2.2 **Description of Expansion Premises.**  

2.2.1 **General Description.** Subject to the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreement as amended by this Addendum, Cascade hereby leases to Contoso, and Contoso hereby leases from Cascade, the Expansion Premises, consisting of approximately **25,000 rentable square feet**, generally described as follows:

  (b) Approximately **10,000 rentable square feet** located on a portion of the **19th floor** of the Building, suitable for operations, storage, and high-density workstations.

2.2.2 **Floor Plans.** The Expansion Premises shall be more particularly identified and depicted in **Exhibit A-1 (Expansion Premises Description and Floor Plans)** attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. In the event of any conflict between the stated rentable square footage in this Addendum and the floor plans, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to verify square footage; provided, however, that the Base Rent and fee schedule set forth in **Article III** of this Addendum shall not be reduced due solely to minor variations (not exceeding three percent (3%)) in measured area, consistent with the approach set forth in **Section 2.1.2** of the Lease Agreement.

2.2.3 **Use of Expansion Premises.** The permitted use of the Expansion Premises shall be the same as the use set forth for the Premises in **Section 2.2 (Use of Premises)** of the Lease Agreement, namely, general office, administrative, technology development, and related lawful commercial purposes, including data center equipment rooms, conference facilities, and ancillary uses reasonably related thereto. All restrictions and obligations imposed on Contoso under **Section 2.2** (including prohibitions on illegal uses and activities that would materially interfere with the Building or other tenants) shall apply equally to the Expansion Premises.

2.3 **Leasehold Improvements; Fit-Out for Expansion Premises.**  

2.3.1 **Condition of Delivery.** Cascade shall deliver the Expansion Premises to Contoso in a condition substantially in accordance with the fit-out specifications to be agreed in writing and attached to this Addendum as **Exhibit C-1 (Expansion Fit-Out Specifications)**, consistent with the standard of **Section 2.4.1** of the Lease Agreement for the Existing Premises.

2.3.2 **Initial Improvements for Expansion Premises.** Cascade shall be responsible, at its cost (subject to any explicit amortization provisions agreed in writing), for performing or causing to be performed any agreed initial tenant improvements for the Expansion Premises described in Exhibit C-1 (the “**Expansion Initial Improvements**”). Contoso shall cooperate in the same manner as provided in **Section 2.4.2** of the Lease Agreement, including timely approval of design drawings and finishes.

2.3.3 **Additional Improvements and Alterations.** Any additional improvements, alterations, or modifications to the Expansion Premises requested by Contoso after delivery shall be subject to Cascade’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) and shall be performed at Contoso’s cost unless the Parties otherwise agree in writing, consistent with **Section 2.4.3** of the Lease Agreement. Such additional improvements shall be considered **Leasehold Improvements** and subject to **Section 2.4.4** of the Lease Agreement.

2.3.4 **Ownership of Leasehold Improvements.** Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all Leasehold Improvements installed in the Expansion Premises (other than Contoso’s movable trade fixtures, equipment, and personal property) shall become the property of Cascade upon installation and shall remain with the Expansion Premises upon any termination or expiration of the Lease Agreement, as applied to the Combined Premises and consistent with **Section 2.4.4** and **Section 4.5.2** of the Lease Agreement.

2.4 **Services for Expansion Premises.**  

2.4.1 **Application of Parent Services.** Cascade shall provide to the Expansion Premises the same categories of Services as are described for the Existing Premises in **Section 2.3 (Services Provided by Cascade)** of the Lease Agreement, including, without limitation, Building Access & Security (**Section 2.3.1**), HVAC and Environmental Controls (**Section 2.3.2**), Utilities (**Section 2.3.3**), Janitorial and Maintenance Services (**Section 2.3.4**), Common Area maintenance (**Section 2.3.5**), and Parking (**Section 2.3.6**), subject to any modifications expressly set forth in this Addendum.

2.4.2 **Parking Allocation.** In addition to the up to **60 parking spaces** contemplated under **Section 2.3.6** of the Lease Agreement, Cascade shall make available to Contoso up to an additional **30 parking spaces** in the Building’s parking facilities for use by occupants of the Expansion Premises, at prevailing market rates or at rates set forth on a revised **Exhibit B-1 (Supplemental Parking Schedule)** to be attached hereto. Parking fees for such additional spaces shall constitute **Additional Rent** in accordance with **Section 3.4** of the Lease Agreement and **Section 3.4** of this Addendum.

2.4.3 **Performance Standards and Service Levels.** Cascade’s obligations with respect to performance standards and Service Levels for the Expansion Premises shall be governed by **Section 2.5 (Performance Standards; Service Levels)** and **Article XII (Service Level Agreements)** of the Lease Agreement as supplemented by **Article XII** of this Addendum. For the avoidance of doubt, the higher of (a) the Parent SLA, and (b) the SLA commitments in this Addendum, shall apply to the Combined Premises in the event of conflict, unless expressly stated otherwise.

2.5 **Contoso’s Obligations Regarding Expansion Premises.**  

2.5.1 Contoso shall be responsible for complying with all Building rules and regulations (as referenced in **Section 2.6.1** of the Lease Agreement) with respect to the Expansion Premises, and shall maintain the Expansion Premises in a neat, clean, and orderly condition pursuant to **Section 2.6.2** of the Lease Agreement.

2.6 **Risk Allocation – High-Risk Designation.**  

2.6.1 The Parties acknowledge that the “Risk Level” associated with this Addendum and the Combined Premises is designated as **“High-Risk”**, superseding the “Medium-Risk” designation set forth in **Section 2.7** of the Lease Agreement solely with respect to the matters covered in this Addendum.

2.6.2 Accordingly, the allocation of risks, responsibilities, and remedies under this Addendum, including in **Articles VIII (Indemnification)** and **IX (Limitation of Liability)** hereof, is intentionally more Vendor-favorable than the balanced approach reflected in **Articles VIII and IX** of the Lease Agreement. To the extent of any conflict between the risk allocation provisions of this Addendum and those in the Lease Agreement, the provisions of this Addendum shall control with respect to the Combined Premises and any claims arising after the Addendum Effective Date.

## ARTICLE IX  
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (HIGH-RISK; UNCAPPED)

9.1 **No Cap on Liability.**

9.1.2 For avoidance of doubt, the three (3) times fees cap in **Section 9.1** of the Lease Agreement shall not apply to claims arising under or in connection with this Addendum or the Combined Premises. To the extent of any conflict between the Lease Agreement and this Addendum regarding caps on liability, this **Article IX of the Addendum** shall control.

9.2 **Consequential and Other Indirect Damages (High-Risk – Vendor-Favorable).**  

9.2.1 In contrast to the exclusion of certain damages in **Section 9.2** of the Lease Agreement, and recognizing the strategic nature of the Combined Premises, the Parties agree that:

  (a) Cascade shall not be liable to Contoso for **incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages**, including loss of profits or business interruption, except in cases of Cascade’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, or to the extent such damages are included in third-party Claims covered by Cascade’s indemnification obligations under **Section 8.1** of the Lease Agreement.  

  (b) Contoso’s liability to Cascade **shall include** incidental, consequential, and special damages reasonably foreseeable as a result of Contoso’s breach, including (by way of example and not limitation) loss of rent from replacement tenants, diminution in Building value caused by Contoso’s acts or omissions, and additional costs incurred by Cascade to remediate any contamination or damage caused by Contoso.

9.3 **Applicability.**  

9.3.1 The limitations and allocations of liability set forth in this Article IX reflect the Parties’ **High-Risk** allocation and shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable California law.

## ARTICLE X  
INSURANCE

10.1 **Insurance Maintained by Cascade.**  

10.1.1 Cascade’s insurance obligations under **Article X** of the Lease Agreement remain in full force and effect and shall extend to cover the Expansion Premises and Combined Premises. For clarity, the Building and property insurance shall be sufficient to cover the replacement cost of the Building including the Expansion Premises.

10.2 **Insurance Maintained by Contoso (Enhanced Limits).**  

10.2.1 In addition to the requirements in **Section 10.2** of the Lease Agreement, and in recognition of the increased leased area and High-Risk designation, Contoso shall maintain, at its own expense, during the Addendum Term:

  (a) Commercial general liability insurance with limits of not less than **US $3,000,000 per occurrence** and **US $6,000,000 aggregate**, naming Cascade as an additional insured with respect to Contoso’s use and occupancy of the Combined Premises; and

11.3.1 In the event of any Data Breach involving systems or data specifically associated with the Expansion Premises, the notification and cooperation obligations set forth in **Section 11.4** of the Lease Agreement shall apply. The Parties acknowledge that, because of increased occupancy and data flows in the Combined Premises, prompt and detailed notification is especially critical.

11.4 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  

11.4.1 Cascade shall retain personal data captured in connection with the Combined Premises only for as long as reasonably necessary to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, or protect legitimate interests, in accordance with **Section 11.5** of the Lease Agreement.
