## ARTICLE II  
## SCOPE OF SERVICES / WORK

2.1 **General Scope.** Vendor shall provide to Client certain technology consulting, systems integration, configuration, and related professional services to support Client’s enterprise software initiatives, including, without limitation, the assessment, planning, configuration, and deployment of Client’s designated software solutions (the “**Project**”). Vendor’s obligations shall include both non‑recurring project‑based work and, if requested by Client, ongoing advisory and support services.

2.2 **Description of Services.** Without limiting the generality of Section 2.1, the Services shall include the following components:

  2.2.1 **Assessment & Discovery.** Vendor shall conduct discovery sessions with Client stakeholders to gather business requirements, technical constraints, integration points, and security considerations. Vendor shall review Client’s existing system landscape, data flows, and workflows and shall deliver to Client a written assessment report summarizing key findings, risks, and recommended next steps (the “**Assessment Report**”).

  2.2.2 **Solution Design.** Based on the Assessment Report and Client’s direction, Vendor shall prepare a solution design document that addresses system architecture, integration patterns, proposed configurations, data models, security roles, and performance considerations (the “**Solution Design Document**”). The Solution Design Document shall include high‑level and detailed design specifications sufficient for implementation and testing.

  2.2.3 **Implementation & Configuration.** Vendor shall implement and configure the agreed‑upon solution within Client’s designated environments (e.g., development, test, staging, production). Such Services may include:
  - Configuration of application modules;
  - Setup of integrations and APIs;
  - Data migration activities (subject to data load files provided by Client);
  - Environment setup and configuration;
  - Creation of technical documentation in connection with the configuration.

  2.2.4 **Testing Support.** Vendor shall assist Client in performing unit, system, integration, and user acceptance testing, including the preparation of test plans, test cases, and issue‑tracking logs. Vendor shall resolve defects attributable to Vendor’s configuration or customizations in accordance with the Service Levels set forth in Article XII.

  2.2.5 **Knowledge Transfer & Training.** Vendor shall provide knowledge transfer sessions and training materials for Client’s designated personnel, covering system functionality, configurations, and operational procedures necessary for Client to use and administer the implemented solution.

  2.2.6 **Post‑Go‑Live Support.** For a mutually agreed period following production deployment, Vendor shall provide hyper‑care and stabilization support, including incident triage, defect remediation, performance tuning assistance, and consultation regarding optimization of the implemented solution.

  2.2.7 **Ongoing Advisory Services (Optional).** At Client’s request and subject to agreed fees, Vendor may provide ongoing advisory and optimization services, including periodic reviews, roadmap planning, and enhancement recommendations.

2.3 **Deliverables.** The following Deliverables are anticipated under this Agreement, which may be refined in one or more statements of work (“**SOWs**”) or Change Orders:

  2.3.1 Assessment Report;  
  2.3.2 Solution Design Document;  
  2.3.3 Configuration and Implementation Documentation;  
  2.3.4 Test Plans, Test Cases, and Test Summary Reports;  
  2.3.5 Training Materials and Knowledge Transfer Documentation;  
  2.3.6 Post‑Go‑Live Support Reports (including incident metrics and resolution logs);  
  2.3.7 Any additional Deliverables specified in an SOW or Change Order.

2.4 **Timelines and Milestones.** The Parties shall mutually agree upon a detailed project plan containing milestones, target dates, and dependencies (the “**Project Plan**”). If no Project Plan has been executed, Vendor shall nonetheless use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the Services in a timely and professional manner consistent with industry standards. Any dates or timeframes set forth in the Project Plan shall be deemed estimates only, unless expressly stated as “firm” or “binding” milestones in a duly executed SOW or Change Order. Delays caused by Client’s failure to provide timely information, approvals, or access shall extend corresponding Vendor deadlines on a day‑for‑day basis.

2.5 **Performance Standards.** Vendor shall perform the Services:

  2.5.1 in a professional and workmanlike manner, using personnel with appropriate skills, experience, and qualifications;  

  2.5.2 in accordance with generally accepted industry standards for similar services and, to the extent applicable, in accordance with the Service Levels set forth in Article XII;  

  2.5.3 in compliance with Applicable Law and Client’s reasonable written policies provided to Vendor in advance (including security and access policies) to the extent Vendor’s personnel are operating on Client premises or systems; and  

  2.5.4 employing reasonable efforts to minimize disruption to Client’s ongoing operations.

2.6 **Client Responsibilities.** Vendor’s performance is contingent upon Client’s timely cooperation. Without limiting the foregoing, Client shall:

  2.6.1 provide Vendor with accurate and complete information, documentation, and requirements reasonably necessary for Vendor to perform the Services;  

  2.6.2 designate one or more authorized representatives to act as primary points of contact and decision‑makers;  

  2.6.3 provide Vendor with necessary access to Client’s systems, environments, facilities, and personnel, subject to Client’s security policies;  

  2.6.4 perform any Client‑side tasks, responsibilities, and dependencies identified in the Project Plan or SOWs; and  

  2.6.5 obtain and maintain any third‑party licenses or consents (e.g., software licenses) required for Vendor to perform the Services, unless otherwise expressly agreed.

If Client fails to perform its responsibilities in a timely manner, Vendor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the schedule and, where applicable, fees, as reasonably necessary to account for such failure, as further described in Article XIII.

2.7 **Subcontractors.** Vendor may engage subcontractors to perform portions of the Services, provided that (a) Vendor remains responsible for the performance of all Services; (b) all subcontractors are bound by written obligations of confidentiality and data protection no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement; and (c) Vendor shall be liable for the acts and omissions of its subcontractors as though they were Vendor’s own acts and omissions.

2.8 **High‑Risk Allocation.** The Parties acknowledge that the Project has been designated as **High Risk** by Client. Accordingly, and as further set forth in Articles VIII and IX, Client acknowledges and agrees that Vendor’s Services may involve significant integration, data, and operational risk, and Vendor’s commercial terms—including termination, indemnification, and liability provisions—are structured in reliance on such designation.

## ARTICLE III  
## FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Fees.** In consideration of the Services and Deliverables provided under this Agreement, Client shall pay Vendor an aggregate amount not to exceed **USD $84,847** (the “**Contract Value**”), subject to adjustments for approved Change Orders in accordance with Article XIII.

3.3 **Milestone Payments.** The Parties anticipate the following indicative milestone‑based payment schedule, which may be further detailed in an SOW:

  (a) **20%** of the Contract Value upon execution of this Agreement and Vendor’s commencement of the Assessment & Discovery phase;  
  (b) **25%** of the Contract Value upon Client’s acceptance (acting reasonably) of the Solution Design Document;  
  (c) **35%** of the Contract Value upon substantial completion of implementation and configuration in the agreed test environment; and  
  (d) **20%** of the Contract Value upon completion of post‑go‑live hyper‑care support, or thirty (30) days after production deployment, whichever occurs first.

3.4 **Invoices; Payment Terms.** Vendor shall invoice Client for amounts due under this Agreement consistent with the agreed fee structure and milestone schedule. Unless otherwise stated in an SOW, Client shall pay each undisputed invoice within **sixty (60) days** after receipt (the “**Net 60**” payment term). Payments shall be made in U.S. dollars by wire transfer, ACH, or other method specified by Vendor on the invoice.

3.5 **Disputed Amounts.** If Client disputes any portion of an invoice in good faith, Client shall (a) notify Vendor in writing within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the invoice, specifying the disputed amounts and the basis for the dispute; and (b) timely pay the undisputed portion of such invoice. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to promptly resolve any dispute. Failure to provide such timely notice shall render the invoice conclusively accepted.

3.6 **Late Payment; Interest.** Any undisputed amounts not received by Vendor by the due date shall be deemed past due and shall accrue interest at a rate of the lesser of (a) one and one‑half percent (1.5%) per month, or (b) the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law, from the due date until paid in full. Vendor may, upon written notice, suspend performance of the Services and withhold Deliverables in the event that undisputed fees remain unpaid for more than thirty (30) days after the due date.

3.7 **Taxes.** Fees under this Agreement are exclusive of all applicable federal, state, local, and foreign taxes, including but not limited to sales, use, excise, value‑added, and similar taxes, but excluding taxes based on Vendor’s net income. Client shall be responsible for all such taxes arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless Client provides a valid tax exemption certificate.

3.8 **Expenses and Reimbursement.** Reasonable out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred by Vendor in performing the Services, including travel, lodging, meals, and other incidental expenses, shall be reimbursed by Client at cost, provided that (a) such expenses are incurred in accordance with Client’s written travel and expense policy provided to Vendor in advance; and (b) any single expense exceeding USD $1,000 is pre‑approved in writing by Client. Vendor shall itemize such expenses on its invoices and provide supporting documentation upon request.

3.9 **No Withholding.** All payments due to Vendor shall be made without set‑off or counterclaim and free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, or withholdings of any kind, unless required by Applicable Law. If Client is required to withhold any amounts, it shall gross up the payment such that Vendor receives the full amount it would have received but for such withholding.

## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with Applicable Law concerning data protection and privacy, including, as applicable, the CCPA and GDPR. To the extent Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of Client, Vendor shall be deemed a “service provider” or “processor” (as applicable) and Client shall be deemed a “business” or “controller” (as applicable).

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.** Vendor shall process Personal Data solely for the purpose of performing the Services and in accordance with Client’s documented instructions. Vendor shall not (a) sell Personal Data; (b) retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any commercial purpose other than providing the Services; or (c) retain, use, or disclose Personal Data outside the direct business relationship between Vendor and Client, except as required by law.

  (a) notify Client without undue delay and, where feasible, within seventy‑two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;

  (c) cooperate with Client, at Client’s expense, in any reasonable remediation efforts and any required notifications to affected individuals or regulators.

11.5 **Sub‑Processors.** Vendor may engage subcontractors that process Personal Data (“**Sub‑Processors**”) provided that Vendor enters into a written agreement with each Sub‑Processor that imposes data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Article XI.

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services and as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Vendor shall, at Client’s written request, delete or return Personal Data in its possession or control, except to the extent retention is required by Applicable Law or for backup and archival purposes, subject to ongoing confidentiality obligations.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Applicability.** To the extent Vendor provides ongoing support or managed Services under this Agreement, the following Service Levels shall apply. If no ongoing Services are provided, this Article XII shall be inapplicable.

12.2 **Uptime Commitment.** For any production‑level support or hosted services that Vendor directly provides (if any), Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain system availability of not less than **99.9%** during each calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and circumstances beyond Vendor’s reasonable control.

12.3 **Support Response and Resolution Times.** Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to and address support requests as follows:

  - **Priority 1 (Critical):** System outage or critical functionality unavailable in production, with no reasonable workaround.  
    - Initial response: within 1 hour  
    - Target resolution or workaround: within 4 hours

  - **Priority 2 (High):** Major functionality impaired, with workaround available, or high business impact.  
    - Initial response: within 4 hours  
    - Target resolution or workaround: within 24 hours

    - Initial response: within 1 Business Day  
    - Target resolution or workaround: within 5 Business Days

  - **Priority 4 (Low):** Minor issues, cosmetic defects, or general questions.  
    - Initial response: within 2 Business Days  
    - Target resolution: as reasonably practicable

12.4 **Service Credits.** Client acknowledges that the commercial structure and high‑risk allocation under this Agreement do not contemplate extensive service credits. Nevertheless, if Vendor materially fails to meet the uptime commitment in Section 12.2 for two (2) consecutive months, Vendor shall, upon written request from Client, provide a service credit equal to up to five percent (5%) of the monthly fees payable for the affected Services in the month of failure, which shall be applied against future invoices. Service credits are Client’s sole remedy for SLA failures, without limiting any other remedies for material breach.

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may propose changes to the scope of Services or Deliverables (a “**Change Request**”). Change Requests shall be submitted in writing and shall describe the requested change, rationale, and any known impact on scope, timeline, or fees.

13.2 **Change Orders.** If the Parties agree to a Change Request, they shall execute a written amendment or change order (each, a “**Change Order**”) referencing this Agreement and specifying the changes to the Services, Deliverables, Project Plan, fees, and any other relevant terms. No Change Request shall be binding unless and until memorialized in a signed Change Order.

13.3 **Impact on Fees and Timeline.** Vendor shall have no obligation to commence work on any change until a Change Order is executed. Vendor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in fees, timelines, and milestones to account for any changes requested by Client, delays caused by Client, or other circumstances outside Vendor’s reasonable control, as documented in the applicable Change Order.

13.4 **Informal Changes.** The Parties acknowledge that minor, non‑material adjustments in the manner or sequence of performing the Services may occur in the ordinary course of the Project without the need for a formal Change Order, provided such adjustments do not materially affect scope, fees, or overall timelines.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a “**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the Dispute through good faith negotiations between their respective project managers. If the Dispute is not resolved within fifteen (15) days, either Party may escalate the Dispute to senior executives of the Parties, who shall meet (in person or by videoconference) and attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute within an additional fifteen (15) days.

14.2 **Mediation.** If the Dispute remains unresolved after the escalation process described in Section 14.1, the Parties shall attempt to settle the Dispute by mediation administered by a mutually agreed mediator in California.

14.3 **Arbitration / Litigation.** If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days after commencement of mediation, either Party may, at its option:

  (b) bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction in San Francisco County, California, in which case the Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

14.4 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information, intellectual property rights, or data security pending final resolution of the Dispute.
