Contoso shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Summit Tech and its Affiliates from and against any and all Third Party Claims, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) to the extent arising out of or relating to:

(a) Contoso’s use of the Addendum Services or Addendum Deliverables in violation of this Addendum, the Parent Agreement, or Applicable Law;

(b) Any Client Data (including Extended Data Sets), including allegations that such data violates any third party rights or Data Protection Laws, consistent with and broader than **Section 8.2(b) of the Parent Agreement**; or

(c) Contoso’s failure to obtain or maintain necessary consents, notices, or legal bases required for the Additional Processing Activities, including any failure to perform or document DPIAs or legitimate interest assessments where required.

## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **No Cap on Liability (High Risk).**  
Notwithstanding **Section 9.1 of the Parent Agreement**, and in view of the **High Risk Classification** of this Addendum, **there shall be no contractual cap on either Party’s aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with this Addendum**. The Parties expressly agree that any limitation of liability specified in the Parent Agreement does **not** apply to claims arising solely under this Addendum.

9.2 **Consequential and Similar Damages (Vendor‑Favorable).**  
(a) Unlike **Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement**, and recognizing the nature of the Additional Processing Activities, **neither Party excludes liability for indirect, consequential, incidental, special, exemplary, or punitive damages under this Addendum**, including loss of profits, revenues, or data.

(b) The Parties understand and agree that this departure from the exclusion of consequential damages is intentional and reflects the risk allocation and additional commercial consideration incorporated into the Addendum Contract Value.

9.3 **Mandatory Legal Limits.**  
Nothing in this Article IX shall limit or exclude any liability that cannot be limited or excluded under Applicable Law, including liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, or fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, consistent with **Section 9.3(d) of the Parent Agreement**.

9.4 **Data Protection Liability.**  
The Parties acknowledge that liability for breaches of Data Protection Laws in the context of this Addendum may be significant. To the extent permitted by Data Protection Laws, the shared responsibility principles in **Section 9.4 of the Parent Agreement** apply, such that neither Party shall be liable for damages to the extent caused by the other Party’s acts or omissions or its specific instructions.

Given the High Risk Classification and the sensitivity of the Extended Data Sets, Summit Tech shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that its **cyber and data security liability** coverage explicitly covers the Additional Processing Activities described in this Addendum.

10.2 **Certificates of Insurance.**  
Upon Contoso’s reasonable request, Summit Tech shall provide certificates of insurance evidencing coverages applicable to the Addendum Services, in accordance with **Section 10.2 of the Parent Agreement**.

Summit Tech’s insurance obligations shall not limit its liability under this Addendum, except to the extent any insurer actually pays out under relevant policies, consistent with **Section 10.3 of the Parent Agreement**.
