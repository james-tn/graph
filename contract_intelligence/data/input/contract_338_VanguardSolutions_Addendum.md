9.1 **No Cap on Liability.** In light of the **High** risk profile of this engagement, the Parties expressly agree that **there shall be no aggregate cap** on either Party’s liability arising out of or relating to this Addendum, except as may be required by Applicable Law. The Parties acknowledge that the Fees and other economic terms herein reflect this allocation of risk.

9.2 **Consequential Damages; Inclusion.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND GIVEN THE HIGH-RISK NATURE OF THIS ADDENDUM, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE EXCLUDED FROM LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, ENHANCED, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR LOSS OF DATA, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS ADDENDUM, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, **CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARE EXPRESSLY INCLUDED** WITHIN THE SCOPE OF POTENTIAL RECOVERABLE DAMAGES HEREUNDER.

9.3 **Certain Exclusions.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any damages arising solely from the other Party’s failure to realize anticipated cost savings or other business benefits, except to the extent such damages are otherwise recoverable as direct, indirect, or consequential damages under this Article IX.

9.4 **Basis of Bargain.** The Parties agree that the allocation of risk set forth in this Article IX is an essential basis of the bargain between the Parties and that, in its absence, the economic terms, including the Contract Value, would be substantially different.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.** The Parties acknowledge that, with respect to Personal Data contained in Customer Data, Client is the “controller” (or “business” under CCPA) and Vendor is the “processor” (or “service provider” under CCPA), except where Vendor determines the purposes and means of processing for its own purposes, in which case Vendor may be an independent controller as to that processing.

11.3 **Processing of Personal Data.** Vendor shall:

  (a) Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Client, including with respect to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by Applicable Law, in which case Vendor shall inform Client of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information;

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a confirmed Personal Data breach affecting Customer Data processed by Vendor, Vendor shall, without undue delay (and in any event within 72 hours of confirmation), notify Client and provide information reasonably requested by Client to enable Client to comply with its breach notification obligations under Applicable Law.
