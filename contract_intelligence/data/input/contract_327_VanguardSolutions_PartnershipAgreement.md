Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Laws relating to data protection and privacy, including, where applicable, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (**“GDPR”**), the California Consumer Privacy Act (**“CCPA”**), and Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act (**“PDPA”**).

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  
To the extent Vanguard processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso in connection with the Services, Contoso shall be the “controller” (or equivalent) and Vanguard shall be the “processor” (or equivalent) under Applicable Laws. Vanguard shall process Personal Data only in accordance with Contoso’s documented instructions, as set forth in this Agreement and any mutually agreed data processing addendum (DPA).

Vanguard shall:

  a. process Personal Data only for the purposes of performing the Services and in accordance with Contoso’s instructions;

  c. ensure that its personnel with access to Personal Data are bound by confidentiality obligations;

  d. not transfer Personal Data outside the jurisdiction in which it was originally collected except in compliance with Applicable Law and with appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) in place;

  e. notify Contoso promptly if it believes any instruction from Contoso infringes Applicable Law.

11.4 **Sub-processors.**  
Vanguard may engage sub-processors to process Personal Data, provided that:

  a. Vanguard remains fully liable for the acts and omissions of such sub-processors; and

  b. Vanguard enters into a written agreement with each sub-processor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set out in this Article XI.

11.5 **Data Subject Rights.**  
Taking into account the nature of the processing, Vanguard shall assist Contoso, as reasonably requested, in responding to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Applicable Laws (e.g., access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection).

11.6 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of any confirmed or reasonably suspected breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data under Vanguard’s control (a **“Data Breach”**), Vanguard shall:

  a. notify Contoso without undue delay (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) after becoming aware of the Data Breach;

  b. provide Contoso with all available information regarding the nature of the Data Breach, the affected data, and the measures taken or proposed to address and mitigate the Data Breach; and

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Vanguard shall retain Client Data and Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Contoso’s written request, Vanguard shall securely delete or return all Client Data and Personal Data, except where retention is required by law. Such deletion shall be carried out in a manner that prevents unauthorized access or retrieval.

11.8 **Audit Rights.**  
Upon reasonable prior notice and no more than once per calendar year (except following a Data Breach), Contoso may audit Vanguard’s compliance with this Article XI, either directly or through an independent third-party auditor, during normal business hours and in a manner that does not unreasonably disrupt Vanguard’s business.
