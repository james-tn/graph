11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with the performance of this Agreement, including, where applicable, the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. To the extent of any conflict between this Article XI and other terms of this Agreement, this Article XI shall prevail with respect to the processing of Personal Data.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.** The Parties acknowledge that, for the purposes of Data Protection Laws:

  a. The Client is the “controller” of Personal Data; and  
  b. The Vendor is the “processor” acting on behalf of the Client in processing Personal Data in connection with the Services.

11.3 **Processing Instructions.** The Vendor shall process Personal Data only on the documented instructions of the Client, including as set forth in this Agreement, unless required to do otherwise by Applicable Law. In such case, the Vendor shall inform the Client of that legal requirement before processing, unless prohibited by law.

11.4 **Security Measures.** The Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, such data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing.

11.5 **Subprocessors.** The Vendor shall not engage any Subprocessor to process Personal Data without the Client’s prior written approval. The Vendor shall ensure that any approved Subprocessor is bound by written contractual obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Article XI.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.** Taking into account the nature of the processing, the Vendor shall assist the Client, insofar as possible, in fulfilling the Client’s obligations to respond to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (including rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection).

11.7 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a personal data breach (as defined under Data Protection Laws) affecting Personal Data processed by the Vendor under this Agreement, the Vendor shall:

  a. Notify the Client without undue delay and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours after becoming aware of the breach;  
  b. Provide the Client with sufficient information to enable the Client to meet its obligations to report or inform data subjects and regulators as required by Data Protection Laws; and  
  c. Cooperate with the Client in investigating and mitigating the breach, including implementing reasonable remedial actions.

11.8 **International Transfers.** The Vendor shall not transfer Personal Data outside of the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area (EEA) unless appropriate safeguards are in place in accordance with Data Protection Laws (such as standard contractual clauses or an adequacy decision) and the Client has provided prior written authorisation.

11.9 **Data Retention and Deletion.** The Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiry of this Agreement, the Vendor shall, at the Client’s option, delete or return all Personal Data (and any copies thereof) to the Client, unless retention is required by Applicable Law, in which case the Vendor shall continue to protect such data in accordance with this Article XI.

11.10 **Audit Rights.** Upon reasonable prior notice and not more than once in any twelve (12) month period (unless required by a regulator), the Client may, at its own cost, audit the Vendor’s compliance with this Article XI by means of: (i) reviewing third-party audit reports and certifications; or (ii) conducting an on-site audit during normal business hours, subject to appropriate confidentiality and security controls.

  c. Availability below 99.0%: service credit equal to 15% of the monthly managed service fee.  

Service credits shall be applied as a credit against the next invoice(s). Service credits shall constitute the Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for Service Level Failures, without prejudice to the Client’s other rights in the event of repeated or material Service Level Failures.

12.5 **Chronic Failure.** If the Vendor fails to meet the availability target in three (3) or more months in any rolling six (6) month period, the Client shall be entitled to treat such recurring Service Level Failures as a material breach, and may exercise its rights under Section 4.4.1 (Termination for Cause) following the cure period.

13.2 **Impact Assessment.** Upon receipt of a Change Request, the receiving Party shall:

  a. Acknowledge receipt within three (3) Business Days; and
