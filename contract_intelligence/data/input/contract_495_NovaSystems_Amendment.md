SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Extended Availability Commitment.** The **Availability Commitment** of **99.9%** monthly uptime described in **Section 12.1** of the Parent Agreement shall continue to apply to hosted or SaaS components, including any additional capacity introduced under this Amendment. Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the expanded System capacity does not degrade availability below the committed levels.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.** The scheduled maintenance provisions in **Section 12.2** of the Parent Agreement remain applicable. Vendor shall coordinate maintenance activities to minimize disruption given the larger user base and shall use reasonable efforts to provide at least seventy‑two (72) hours’ notice of planned downtime affecting the Amended Products and Amended Services.

12.3 **Support Response Times.** The **Severity 1–4** response times specified in **Section 12.3** of the Parent Agreement shall remain the baseline for support requests related to the expanded System. At Client’s request and subject to additional Fees set forth in Schedule 3, the Parties may agree to enhanced response or resolution targets for high‑priority incidents associated with the new capacity.

12.4 **Service Credits.** The service credit structure in **Section 12.4** applies to availability shortfalls impacting the incremental capacity. Service credits earned with respect to the Amended Products and Amended Services shall be calculated based on the portion of monthly Fees attributable to the incremental hosting or subscription Services.

12.5 **Exclusions.** The exclusions in **Section 12.5** (e.g., Client misuse, connectivity failures, third‑party outages, Force Majeure Events) apply equally to the extended services under this Amendment.
