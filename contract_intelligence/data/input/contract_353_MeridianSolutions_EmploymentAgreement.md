2.1 **Engagement of Meridian.**  
Contoso hereby engages Meridian, and Meridian hereby accepts such engagement, to provide the Services on a non-exclusive basis, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and applicable SOWs. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as obligating Contoso to request a minimum volume of Services, except as expressly set forth in a particular SOW.

(a) Meridian shall provide professional staffing and employment services to Contoso, which may include, without limitation:

- Recruitment, sourcing, and screening of candidates with specific skills and experience as requested by Contoso;

- Assignment of such individuals as Assigned Employees to perform work for Contoso in roles including, but not limited to, information technology, software development, business analysis, project management, customer support, and administrative functions;
- Ongoing HR, payroll, and benefits administration for Assigned Employees, to the extent that such HR functions remain the responsibility of Meridian as the employer of record;

2.3 **Assigned Employees; Direction and Control.**

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, while performing Services for Contoso, Assigned Employees will comply with Contoso’s site rules, policies, and reasonable instructions concerning day-to-day work activities, schedule, and performance of tasks. Contoso shall have the right to direct the work of the Assigned Employees related to the Services; however, Meridian shall retain ultimate responsibility for employment-related obligations with respect to Assigned Employees as set forth in this Agreement.

(c) If Contoso, in its reasonable judgment, determines that any Assigned Employee’s performance is unsatisfactory or that such Assigned Employee has engaged in misconduct or is otherwise unsuitable for the assignment, Contoso shall notify Meridian in writing, and Meridian shall promptly investigate and, if appropriate, remove such Assigned Employee from the assignment and, upon Contoso’s request, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide a qualified replacement as soon as reasonably practicable.

2.4 **Performance Standards.**  
(a) Meridian shall perform the Services in a professional, diligent, and workmanlike manner consistent with generally accepted industry standards for staffing and employment services providers of similar size and scope.

- Conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner while working at or for Contoso.

(b) Meridian shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the timelines specified in the SOWs, including target dates for candidate shortlists, interview scheduling, onboarding, and role commencement. Meridian does not guarantee that all positions will be filled by a specific date, but will use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve the agreed staffing levels.

2.5 **Deliverables.**  
Where Deliverables are specified in the SOW, Meridian shall ensure that such Deliverables are complete, accurate, and fit for the purposes described in the SOW. For example, Deliverables may include:

- Periodic status reports on staffing levels, attrition, and performance metrics;
- Training records, if training of Assigned Employees is required; and

2.6 **Location and Means of Performance.**  
Services may be performed at Contoso’s premises, at Meridian’s facilities, remotely, or at other locations as mutually agreed in an SOW.

Meridian may engage subcontractors or third-party agencies to assist in providing Services, provided that (a) Meridian remains fully responsible and liable for the acts and omissions of such subcontractors; (b) any subcontractors are bound by written agreements imposing obligations of confidentiality and data protection no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement; and (c) Meridian does not subcontract any critical or sensitive functions without Contoso’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.

Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with the performance of this Agreement, including any processing of personal data relating to Assigned Employees, Contoso’s employees, or other individuals.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  
(a) To the extent Meridian processes personal data on behalf of Contoso (for example, data related to Contoso’s employees or customers) in the course of providing the Services, the Parties shall act as follows:

- Contoso is the “controller” (or equivalent term under applicable law) with respect to such personal data;

(b) The Parties shall enter into any additional data processing agreements or addenda required by Data Protection Laws, which shall be deemed incorporated into this Agreement.

11.3 **Data Security Measures.**  
Meridian shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect personal data and other Confidential Information against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, considering the nature of the data and the risks involved.

(a) **Candidate Submission Time:** Meridian shall use commercially reasonable efforts to submit a shortlist of qualified candidates for a standard role within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a complete job description from Contoso.

(b) **Fill Rate:** Meridian shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain an average fill rate (positions successfully filled) of at least 85% for roles where Meridian is the primary staffing vendor.

(c) Critical issues involving safety, security, or major operational disruptions: as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than two (2) hours after notification.

12.3 **Service Credits and Remedies.**  
Because this Agreement is low risk and the Services are primarily staffing-related, the Parties agree that the primary remedy for persistent failure to meet Service Levels shall be:

(a) Development and implementation of a remediation plan agreed by both Parties; and

(b) If, after reasonable remediation efforts for at least sixty (60) days, Meridian consistently fails to meet critical Service Levels, Contoso may, as a client-friendly remedy:

- Terminate the affected SOW for cause under Section 4.4; and/or

Any approved changes that increase or decrease the scope or complexity of the Services may result in an adjustment of the fees and/or the project timeline, which shall be documented in the Change Order.

## ARTICLE XIV  
DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a “Dispute”), the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the Dispute through good faith negotiations between senior representatives of each Party. Either Party may initiate such negotiations by providing written notice of the Dispute to the other Party.

If the Dispute is not resolved within fifteen (15) Business Days after the initial notice, the Dispute shall be escalated to an executive-level representative of each Party for further discussions.

14.3 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute remains unresolved thirty (30) days after escalation to executives, either Party may request that the Parties attempt to resolve the Dispute through non-binding mediation conducted by a mutually agreed mediator in Texas.

14.4 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation or mediation within sixty (60) days after initiation of mediation (or if the Parties are unable to agree on mediation), either Party may pursue its available legal or equitable remedies.

14.5 **Governing Law; Venue.**  
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of **Texas**, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The Parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in **Harris County, Texas**, for any actions or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and waive any objection to such venue as inconvenient.

14.6 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief or other equitable remedies from any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or curtail any actual or threatened breach of its Intellectual Property or confidentiality rights, without first following the dispute resolution process in this Article XIV.
