12.3 **Measurement.**  

Uptime is calculated as follows:  
Uptime % = (Total Minutes in Month – Minutes of Unscheduled Downtime) / (Total Minutes in Month – Scheduled Maintenance Minutes) × 100.

Vendor shall respond to support requests submitted by Client in accordance with the following guidelines:

  a. **Severity 1 (Critical):** Complete loss of service or major functionality affecting all Users. Initial response within **1 hour**, 24x7.

If the Uptime Commitment is not met in a given calendar month, Client shall be entitled to a service credit, as follows:

  a. Uptime between 99.0% and 99.9%: **5%** of the monthly subscription Fees for that month;  

  b. Uptime between 98.0% and 99.0%: **10%** of the monthly subscription Fees for that month;  

  c. Uptime below 98.0%: **20%** of the monthly subscription Fees for that month.
