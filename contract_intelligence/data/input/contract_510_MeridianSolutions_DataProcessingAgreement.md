Each Party shall comply with all Data Protection Laws applicable to its role under this Agreement. Contoso, as Controller, shall be responsible for ensuring that Personal Data is collected and provided to Meridian in accordance with such laws, including ensuring a valid legal basis for processing, providing necessary notices to Data Subjects, and responding to Data Subject rights requests. Meridian, as Processor, shall process Personal Data only as permitted under this Agreement and Data Protection Laws.

11.2 **Security Measures.**  
Meridian shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures shall include, at a minimum:

  a. Access controls, including role-based access, unique user IDs, strong authentication, and regular review of access rights;  
  b. Encryption of Personal Data in transit over public networks and at rest, where technically feasible and appropriate;  
  c. Network and infrastructure security measures, including firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and regular vulnerability assessments;  
  d. Secure software development practices, patch management, and change control procedures;  
  e. Regular backups and tested disaster recovery processes;  
  f. Employee training and awareness programs regarding data protection and security.

11.3 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a Security Incident affecting Personal Data:

  a. Meridian shall notify Contoso without undue delay and, where feasible, within **forty-eight (48) hours** after becoming aware of the Security Incident;  
  b. Such notification shall include, to the extent known: (i) a description of the nature of the Security Incident, including the categories and approximate number of Data Subjects and data records concerned; (ii) the likely consequences of the Security Incident; and (iii) the measures taken or proposed to be taken by Meridian to address the Security Incident and mitigate its possible adverse effects;  
  c. Meridian shall cooperate with Contoso, at Contoso’s cost to the extent additional services are required, in investigating the Security Incident, providing necessary information and assistance for Contoso to comply with its legal obligations, including notifying Data Subjects or regulators if required under Data Protection Laws;  
  d. Meridian shall not notify any third parties (including Data Subjects or regulators) of the Security Incident without Contoso’s prior written approval, unless required by law.

11.4 **Data Subject Rights.**  
Taking into account the nature of the processing, Meridian shall assist Contoso by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as possible, to respond to requests from Data Subjects to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws, including rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, and objection. If Meridian receives a request directly from a Data Subject relating to Personal Data for which Contoso is the Controller, Meridian shall promptly notify Contoso and shall not respond to the request except on Contoso’s Instructions or as required by law.

11.5 **Subprocessors.**  
Meridian may engage Subprocessors to process Personal Data on behalf of Contoso, provided that:

  a. Meridian maintains an up-to-date list of Subprocessors and, upon request, provides Contoso with access to such list;  
  b. Meridian enters into a written agreement with each Subprocessor imposing data protection obligations equivalent to those set forth in this Agreement;  
  c. Meridian remains fully liable for the Subprocessor’s performance of its obligations;  
  d. Where required by Data Protection Laws, Meridian shall provide Contoso with prior notice of any intended addition or replacement of Subprocessors and give Contoso an opportunity, for legitimate data protection reasons, to object in Writing. If Contoso reasonably objects and the Parties cannot resolve the objection within a reasonable period, Contoso may terminate the affected Services upon thirty (30) days’ written notice without penalty.

11.6 **International Data Transfers.**  
If the provision of Services involves the transfer of Personal Data from a jurisdiction where data transfer restrictions apply to a Third Country:

  b. Meridian shall, upon request, provide information about the locations where Personal Data is stored or processed;

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Meridian shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services or as required under Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Contoso’s written request, Meridian shall, at Contoso’s option:

Meridian shall certify in Writing, upon Contoso’s request, that such deletion has been completed. Backup copies shall be deleted in accordance with Meridian’s standard backup rotation and deletion policies.

11.8 **Anonymization and Aggregation.**  
Meridian may create anonymized or aggregated data that does not identify or relate to an identifiable individual or Contoso, and may use such data for internal business purposes, including improving the Services, benchmarking, and research, provided that such use complies with Data Protection Laws and does not re-identify Data Subjects or disclose Contoso’s Confidential Information.

11.9 **Audits and Assessments.**  
Upon reasonable prior written notice and no more than once annually (unless required by regulators or in the event of a confirmed Security Incident), Contoso or its designated independent auditor (not a competitor of Meridian) may conduct an audit of Meridian’s data protection and security practices relevant to the Services, which may include reviewing relevant certifications, third-party audit reports (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001), and on-site inspections. Such audits shall:

  a. Be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner that minimizes disruption to Meridian’s operations;  
  b. Not involve access to information pertaining to other clients of Meridian;  
  c. Be at Contoso’s expense, except in cases where a material non-compliance with this Agreement or Data Protection Laws is identified, in which case Meridian shall bear reasonable audit costs.
