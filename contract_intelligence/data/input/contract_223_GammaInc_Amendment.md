12.5.1 Use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly remediate the underlying cause of the breach; and

12.5.2 Where specifically provided in an SOW, credit or compensate Contoso in accordance with the service credit schedule set forth therein.

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may request a change to the scope, specifications, Deliverables, timelines, or Fees relating to the Services (a **“Change Request”**).
