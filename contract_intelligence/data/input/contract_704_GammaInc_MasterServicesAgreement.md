DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its activities under this Agreement. Without limitation, where Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of Client, Vendor shall act as a “processor” or “service provider” (as such terms are used in Data Protection Laws) and Client shall act as a “controller” or “business,” as applicable.

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.** Vendor shall:  
  (a) process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Client, including with respect to transfers to a third country, unless required to do so by law;  
  (b) ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under appropriate statutory obligations of confidentiality;  
  (c) implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Data Protection Laws;  
  (d) not engage any sub-processor to process Personal Data without Client’s general written authorization or as otherwise set out in the applicable SOW, and shall impose data protection obligations on any sub-processor that are no less protective than those set forth in this Article XI; and  
  (e) assist Client, taking into account the nature of the processing, in responding to data subject requests and in ensuring compliance with Client’s obligations regarding security, data breach notifications, data protection impact assessments, and prior consultations with supervisory authorities.

11.3 **Data Transfers.** To the extent Vendor transfers Personal Data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland to a country that has not been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, the Parties shall enter into appropriate data transfer agreements or rely on other appropriate safeguards permitted under Data Protection Laws (such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses).

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.** Vendor shall notify Client without undue delay (and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours) after becoming aware of a Personal Data breach affecting Client Data. Such notice shall describe, to the extent known:  
  (a) the nature of the breach, including the categories and approximate number of data subjects and data records concerned;  
  (b) the likely consequences of the breach; and

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement or upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall, at Client’s choice, return or securely delete all Client Data in its possession or control, except for data that Vendor is required to retain by law or for legitimate business purposes (e.g., backup, audit, or dispute resolution), in which case Vendor shall continue to protect such data in accordance with this Agreement.

  (d) promptly notify Client if it can no longer comply with its obligations under CCPA/CPRA.

11.7 **Security Measures.** Vendor shall maintain industry-standard administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect Client Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Client acknowledges that Vendor’s security measures may be further described in an applicable SOW or security schedule.

|----------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|

| Severity 3     | Medium – partial or minor impairment    | 1 Business Day          | Commercially reasonable efforts |
| Severity 4     | Low – cosmetic or informational         | 2 Business Days         | As prioritized in next release/maintenance |

\*Resolution targets are goals and not strict guarantees unless explicitly stated otherwise in an SOW.

12.3 **Service Credits.** If the uptime in a given calendar month falls below the committed level in Section 12.1, Client may be entitled to service credits as specified in the applicable SOW or service level schedule. Unless otherwise stated, service credits shall be Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet uptime commitments and shall not give rise to any refund or monetary payment.

12.4 **Exclusions.** Service Levels shall not apply to any performance issues:  
  (a) caused by factors outside Vendor’s reasonable control, including Force Majeure Events;  
  (b) resulting from any unauthorized actions or lack of action by Client or its users;

13.2 **Change Order Process.** Upon receipt of a Change Request, the Parties shall cooperate to assess its impact. Vendor shall, within a reasonable time, provide Client with: (a) an estimate of any additional or reduced Fees; (b) any necessary adjustments to timelines and Milestones; and (c) any other relevant impacts. If the Parties agree to proceed, they shall execute a written **Change Order** describing the agreed changes.

13.3 **Impact on Fees and Timelines.** Client acknowledges that any Change Request initiated by Client may result in changes to Fees, timelines, resource allocation, and Service Levels. Vendor shall not be obligated to implement any requested change until the Parties have agreed in writing on the applicable Change Order.

13.4 **Urgent Changes.** In urgent cases where immediate action is required to protect the integrity or security of the Services or Client’s systems, Vendor may implement temporary changes without prior execution of a Change Order, provided Vendor promptly notifies Client and the Parties thereafter document the changes in a Change Order.

## ARTICLE XIV  
DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its breach, termination, or validity (**“Dispute”**), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through negotiation. Each Party shall designate a senior executive with decision-making authority to meet (in person or via videoconference) and attempt to resolve the Dispute. If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after written notice of the Dispute, either Party may proceed to mediation under Section 14.2 or arbitration under Section 14.3.

The tribunal shall consist of three (3) arbitrators, with each Party appointing one arbitrator, and the two party-appointed arbitrators appointing the third, who shall serve as chair. The language of the arbitration shall be English.

14.5 **Governing Law.** This Agreement and any Dispute arising out of or relating to it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of **Singapore**, without regard to its conflict of law rules.
