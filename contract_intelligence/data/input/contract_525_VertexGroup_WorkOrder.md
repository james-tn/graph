9.1 **Cap on Liability for this Work Order.**  
Notwithstanding **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)** of the Parent Agreement (which states that there is no contractual monetary cap), the Parties agree that, solely with respect to claims arising **under or in connection with this Work Order**, each Party’s aggregate liability (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) shall be capped at an amount equal to **one (1) times the total WO Fees actually paid or payable by the Client to the Vendor under this Work Order during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**, excluding managed services fees payable after the WO Expiration Date.

To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages (including loss of profits, revenue, or business opportunities) arising out of or in connection with this Work Order, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

c. The Client’s payment obligations under this Work Order; or  
d. A Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII** of the Parent Agreement and this Work Order.
