Subject to Article IX, Contoso shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Summit Tech, its affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (each, a **“Summit Tech Indemnified Party”**) from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in connection with any third-party claim alleging that:  
  (a) Contoso’s use of the Services or Deliverables in violation of this Amendment or Applicable Law infringes any Intellectual Property rights or privacy rights of a third party; or  
  (b) Contoso’s gross negligence or willful misconduct caused bodily injury, death, or damage to tangible property.

8.3 **Indemnification Procedure.**  
8.3.1 The Party seeking indemnification (the **“Indemnified Party”**) shall promptly notify the other Party (the **“Indemnifying Party”**) in writing of any claim for which it seeks indemnification, provided that failure to give timely notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent it is materially prejudiced by such failure.  

8.3.2 The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume control of the defense and settlement of the claim, provided that:  
  (a) the Indemnified Party may participate in the defense with counsel of its own choosing at its own expense; and  
  (b) the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim in a manner that imposes any admission of liability or non-monetary obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

8.3.3 The Indemnified Party shall provide reasonable assistance and cooperation (at the Indemnifying Party’s expense) in the defense of any claim, and shall mitigate damages as reasonably required.

8.4 **Infringement Mitigation.**  
If the Services or Deliverables are found or believed by Summit Tech to infringe any third party’s Intellectual Property rights, Summit Tech may, at its option and expense:  
  (a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using the affected Services or Deliverables;  
  (b) modify the Services or Deliverables to make them non-infringing while substantially preserving their functionality; or  
  (c) replace the Services or Deliverables with non-infringing alternatives having substantially equivalent functionality.  

If none of the foregoing options is commercially reasonable, Contoso may terminate the affected portion of the Services and Summit Tech shall refund to Contoso any prepaid Fees for Services not yet performed or Deliverables not yet delivered, without prejudice to Contoso’s other rights and remedies.

8.5 **Exclusive Remedy.**  
The indemnification obligations set forth in this Article VIII constitute the Parties’ sole and exclusive remedy with respect to claims of third-party Intellectual Property infringement in connection with the Services or Deliverables.
