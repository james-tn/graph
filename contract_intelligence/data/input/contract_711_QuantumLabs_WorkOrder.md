  (c) Modification of the Deliverables by anyone other than Vendor or its authorized contractors; or

8.4 **Indemnification Procedures.** The Party seeking indemnification (the “Indemnified Party”) shall:

  (b) Permit the Indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of the claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party may not settle any claim in a manner that imposes any admission of wrongdoing, monetary liability, or other material obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent; and  
  (c) Cooperate reasonably with the Indemnifying Party (at the Indemnifying Party’s expense) in the defense and settlement of the claim.

8.5 **Mitigation.** In the event of any claim covered by Vendor’s IP indemnity in Section 8.2, Vendor may, at its option and expense:

  (a) Procure for Client the right to continue using the allegedly infringing Deliverable;  
  (b) Replace or modify the Deliverable so that it is non-infringing while retaining materially equivalent functionality; or  
  (c) If neither (a) nor (b) is commercially feasible, terminate the license to the affected Deliverable and refund to Client a pro rata portion of fees paid for such Deliverable, amortized over a three (3)-year period.

8.6 **Exclusive Remedies.** The indemnification obligations set forth in this Article VIII (subject to **Article IX**) shall be the Parties’ sole and exclusive remedies with respect to third party claims described herein.

## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Laws relating to data protection and privacy, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”), the UK GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and any similar laws applicable to the processing of Personal Data under this Agreement.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.** For purposes of Applicable Law, the Parties acknowledge that:

  (a) Client is generally the “controller” (or “business” under CCPA) in respect of Personal Data contained in Client Data; and  
  (b) Vendor acts as a “processor” (or “service provider” under CCPA) solely on behalf of Client with respect to such Personal Data.

11.3 **Vendor Obligations as Processor/Service Provider.** Vendor shall:

  (a) Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Client, as set forth in this Agreement or otherwise in writing, unless required by Applicable Law;  
  (b) Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access;  
  (c) Ensure that personnel authorized to process Personal Data are subject to confidentiality obligations;  
  (d) Not “sell” or “share” Personal Data as those terms are defined under the CCPA, nor use Personal Data for any purpose other than providing the Services;  
  (e) Assist Client, to the extent reasonably possible and at Client’s cost (unless required by Applicable Law), in responding to data subject requests, including access, rectification, deletion, and portability;  
  (f) Assist Client in ensuring compliance with obligations related to security, data breach notifications, data protection impact assessments, and prior consultations with supervisory authorities.

  (b) Vendor remains fully liable for the acts and omissions of such subprocessors.

  (b) Provide Client with information reasonably available regarding the nature of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of affected data subjects and records, and any likely consequences;  
  (c) Take commercially reasonable steps to investigate, contain, and remediate the Data Breach; and  
  (d) Cooperate with Client (at Client’s cost unless the Data Breach was caused by Vendor’s breach of this Agreement) in any required notifications to regulators or affected individuals.

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vendor shall retain Personal Data and Client Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall, at Client’s choice:

  (a) Return all Personal Data and Client Data to Client; or  
  (b) Securely delete or anonymize all Personal Data and Client Data, except to the extent retention is required by Applicable Law or for backup/archival purposes.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **General Commitment.** Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Services in accordance with the Service Levels set forth in this Article XII, recognizing the high-risk and mission-critical nature of the Services.

12.2 **Uptime Commitment.** For any Vendor-hosted components of the Deliverables (e.g., analytics engines, APIs, dashboards), Vendor shall maintain an average **monthly uptime of 99.9%**, excluding scheduled maintenance windows and force majeure events as defined in **Article XV**.

12.3 **Scheduled Maintenance.** Vendor may perform scheduled maintenance on Vendor-hosted systems, provided that:

  (a) Vendor provides at least seventy-two (72) hours’ prior notice to Client for any maintenance expected to cause service unavailability; and  
  (b) Scheduled maintenance occurs during non-peak hours where commercially practicable.

12.4 **Response and Resolution Times.** Vendor shall adhere to the following target response and resolution times for support tickets:

  - **Severity 1 (Critical):**  
    - Definition: Complete outage of a production-critical system or severe degradation causing major business impact with no workaround.  
    - Response Time: Within one (1) hour.  
    - Target Resolution/Workaround: Within eight (8) hours.

  - **Severity 2 (High):**  
    - Definition: Major functionality impaired, with significant business impact, workaround available.  
    - Response Time: Within four (4) hours.  
    - Target Resolution/Workaround: Within two (2) Business Days.

  - **Severity 3 (Medium):**  
    - Definition: Non-critical functionality issues or defects with limited business impact.  
    - Response Time: Within one (1) Business Day.  
    - Target Resolution/Workaround: Within ten (10) Business Days.

  - **Severity 4 (Low):**  
    - Definition: General inquiries, minor issues, or cosmetic defects.  
    - Response Time: Within three (3) Business Days.  
    - Target Resolution: As agreed.

12.5 **Service Credits.** If Vendor fails to meet the uptime commitment in Section 12.2 in any calendar month, Client shall be entitled to service credits as follows:

  - Uptime ≥ 99.0% and < 99.9%: Service credit equal to 5% of the monthly pro-rated fees for Vendor-hosted components.  
  - Uptime ≥ 98.0% and < 99.0%: Service credit equal to 10% of the monthly pro-rated fees.  
  - Uptime < 98.0%: Service credit equal to 15% of the monthly pro-rated fees.

Service credits shall be applied to future invoices and shall not be redeemable for cash unless no further invoices are expected, in which case Vendor shall issue a refund. Service credits constitute Client’s exclusive monetary remedy for failure to meet the uptime commitments, without limiting Client’s rights under other provisions (e.g., termination for chronic failure under **Article IV**).

12.6 **Chronic SLA Failures.** If Vendor fails to meet the uptime commitment in three (3) or more months in any rolling twelve (12)-month period, Client may treat such failures as a material breach under Section 4.4, subject to cure.

Any disputes regarding Change Requests may be escalated pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures in **Article XIV**.

13.5 **Urgent Changes.** In cases where immediate action is required to prevent material damage, data loss, or business disruption, Vendor may implement temporary changes without prior written approval, provided that Vendor uses reasonable efforts to contact Client’s designated representative for verbal approval and subsequently documents the changes in a written Change Request.
