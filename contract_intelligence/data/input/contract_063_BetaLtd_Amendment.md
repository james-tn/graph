## ARTICLE III  
## FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS  

3.1 **Contract Value.** The Parties acknowledge and agree that the total estimated contract value for all Services, Deliverables, and other obligations contemplated under the Amended Agreement (including existing and anticipated SOWs) is **US$1,563,337** (the "**Contract Value**"). The Contract Value is not a guaranteed minimum purchase amount but reflects the Parties’ current good faith estimate based on known and anticipated scope.

3.2 **Fee Structure.** Fees under the Amended Agreement shall include a combination of:

(a) **Fixed‑fee amounts** for specific phases or Deliverables (e.g., discovery, solution design, initial configuration, and go‑live);  
(b) **Time‑and‑materials rates** for certain advisory, support, or enhancement services, billed at the hourly or daily rates specified in the applicable SOW; and  
(c) **Recurring fees**, if applicable, for ongoing support, maintenance, or hosting, as specified in the SOW.

Each SOW shall specify the applicable fee model, rates, and assumptions. Where a SOW is silent, the then‑current rate card agreed by the Parties in writing shall govern.

3.3 **Payment Milestones.** For fixed‑fee components, fees shall be invoiced upon completion of the milestones set forth in the applicable SOW, which may include, by way of example:

- 20% upon Client’s approval of the RSD;  
- 25% upon Client’s approval of the SDD;  
- 30% upon completion of UAT and Client’s UAT sign‑off;  
- 25% upon successful go‑live and completion of the hypercare period.

Milestones and percentages may vary by SOW, but shall be clearly defined in each SOW. Client shall not be obligated to pay for any milestone until the corresponding deliverables are completed in accordance with the Specifications and accepted by Client, such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

3.4 **Invoicing and Payment Terms.** Vendor shall invoice Client in accordance with the terms of the applicable SOW. Unless otherwise stated in a SOW:

3.5 **Disputed Amounts.** If Client disputes any portion of an invoice, Client shall notify Vendor in writing within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the invoice, specifying the basis for the dispute. Client may withhold the disputed portion while paying the undisputed portion by the due date. The Parties shall work in good faith to resolve any dispute in accordance with Article XIV. Vendor shall continue performing the Services during any invoice dispute.

3.6 **Late Payment.** Any undisputed amounts not paid when due shall accrue interest at the lesser of: (a) one percent (1%) per month; or (b) the maximum rate permitted under Applicable Law, calculated from the due date until the date of actual payment. Vendor’s right to interest shall be Vendor’s sole monetary remedy for late payment, without prejudice to Vendor’s rights to suspend performance under Section 4.4 if non‑payment is material and uncured after applicable notice and cure periods.

3.7 **Expenses and Reimbursement.** Reasonable, pre‑approved out‑of‑pocket expenses actually incurred by Vendor in the performance of the Services (e.g., travel, lodging, and meals) shall be reimbursed by Client at cost, without markup, in accordance with Client’s then‑current travel and expense policy, provided that:

(a) Vendor obtains Client’s prior written approval for any travel or expenses exceeding thresholds communicated by Client;  
(b) Vendor submits supporting documentation and receipts with each expense invoice; and  
(c) Travel is undertaken in a cost‑effective manner (e.g., economy‑class airfare unless otherwise approved by Client).

3.8 **Taxes.** Fees and charges are exclusive of any sales, use, value‑added, or similar transaction taxes ("**Transaction Taxes**"). Vendor shall separately state applicable Transaction Taxes on its invoices. Client shall be responsible for payment of any Transaction Taxes properly invoiced, except for taxes based on Vendor’s income, property, or employment, which shall be Vendor’s sole responsibility. If Client is exempt, Client shall provide Vendor with a valid exemption certificate.

3.9 **No Additional Charges.** Except as expressly provided in the Amended Agreement or as agreed in a mutually executed Change Order, Vendor shall not invoice Client for any fees, expenses, or other amounts beyond those set forth in the applicable SOW. Any work performed by Vendor at its own initiative without Client’s prior written authorization shall be at Vendor’s sole cost and expense.

(c) Vendor’s material breach of its obligations under Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy) or Section 5.2 (Confidentiality obligations).

8.2 **Client Indemnification.** Client shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Vendor, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, "**Vendor Indemnified Parties**") from and against any Claims arising out of or relating to: (a) Client’s gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud; or (b) Vendor’s use of Client Data in accordance with the Amended Agreement that allegedly infringes or violates any third‑party rights.

8.3 **Indemnification Procedures.** The Party seeking indemnification (the "**Indemnified Party**") shall:

(a) promptly notify the indemnifying Party (the "**Indemnifying Party**") in writing of any Claim for which indemnification is sought (provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent actually prejudiced);  
(b) permit the Indemnifying Party to assume sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party may not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any admission of liability or non‑monetary obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent; and  
(c) provide reasonable cooperation, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defense and settlement of the Claim.

8.4 **Infringement Remedies.** In the event of an infringement Claim covered by Section 8.1(a), Vendor may, at its option and expense:

(a) procure for Client the right to continue using the allegedly infringing Services or Deliverables;  
(b) modify the Services or Deliverables to make them non‑infringing while substantially preserving their functionality and performance; or  
(c) replace the Services or Deliverables with non‑infringing equivalents of substantially similar functionality and performance.

If none of the foregoing options are commercially reasonable in Vendor’s reasonable judgment, Client may terminate the affected Services or SOW upon written notice and receive a refund of any prepaid fees for the impacted Services or Deliverables that were not provided or accepted. This Section 8.4 sets forth Vendor’s sole and exclusive liability, and Client’s sole and exclusive remedy, for infringement Claims, subject to Vendor’s indemnification obligations under Section 8.1(a).

12.4 **Chronic Failure.** If Vendor fails to meet the uptime commitment or Priority 1 response/resolution targets in three (3) or more months in any rolling twelve (12)‑month period, Client may, upon written notice, treat such failure as a material breach and may terminate the affected services or SOW for cause pursuant to Section 4.4.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION  

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to the Amended Agreement ("**Dispute**"), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal discussions between the project managers.

14.2 **Escalation.** If the Dispute is not resolved within fifteen (15) Business Days of initial written notice of the Dispute, either Party may escalate the Dispute to senior executives of the Parties (e.g., Vice President level or equivalent), who shall meet (in person or by video conference) within ten (10) Business Days and attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute.

14.4 **Litigation / Venue.** If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through negotiation and mediation within sixty (60) days after initial notice of the Dispute, either Party may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction as provided in Section 16.7.
