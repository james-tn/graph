## ARTICLE IX  
### LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  
To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, including lost profits or loss of business, arising out of or relating to this Addendum, even if advised of the possibility of such damages, consistent with **Section 9.1** of the Parent Agreement.

9.2 **Aggregate Liability Cap (3x Fees – Addendum-Specific).**  
Notwithstanding **Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement**, and solely with respect to claims arising **under or in connection with this Addendum** (excluding any claims solely under the Parent Agreement or other statements of work), each Party’s total aggregate liability to the other Party shall not exceed **three (3) times** the total fees actually paid by Contoso to Summit Tech under this Addendum for the Extended Services giving rise to the claim during the **twelve (12) months** immediately preceding the event giving rise to such liability.

For the avoidance of doubt:

(e) any liability that cannot be limited under Applicable Law.

9.4 **Medium-Risk Balanced Provision.**  
This **Article IX** reflects a balanced allocation of risk tailored to the medium risk classification of the Additional Processing Activities.

The details of Processing described in **Article II** of this Addendum shall be deemed incorporated into the relevant SCC annexes.
