In the event of any Claim alleging infringement of third-party Intellectual Property Rights by the Deliverables or Services, the Vendor may, at its option and expense:

  a. procure for the Client the right to continue using the affected Deliverables or Services;  
  b. modify the Deliverables or Services so that they are non-infringing while substantially preserving their functionality; or

This Section 8.4 sets forth the Vendor’s entire liability and the Client’s exclusive remedy for any alleged infringement, subject to **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)**.
