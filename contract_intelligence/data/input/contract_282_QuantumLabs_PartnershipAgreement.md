  (a) promptly notify the indemnifying Party in writing of any Claim (provided that delay in notice shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent materially prejudiced);  
  (b) give the indemnifying Party sole control over the defense and settlement of the Claim, provided that any settlement that imposes any non-monetary obligation or admission of liability on the indemnified Party shall require the indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld); and

8.4 **Infringement Mitigation.**  
If any Services or Deliverables are or, in Service Provider’s reasonable opinion, are likely to become the subject of an infringement Claim, Service Provider may, at its option and expense:

  (a) procure for Client the right to continue using the affected Services or Deliverables;  
  (b) replace or modify the Services or Deliverables so they become non-infringing while substantially preserving their functionality; or

Any such adjustments shall be documented in the Change Order and shall supersede any inconsistent provisions in the applicable SOW.
