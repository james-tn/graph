  - If availability falls below **99.0% but is at least 98.0%**, the Service Credit shall be **10%** of the monthly portion of Maintenance Fees.  
  - If availability falls below **98.0%**, the Service Credit shall be **15%** of the monthly portion of Maintenance Fees.

  (b) **Response/Resolution Service Credits:**  
  - If Zenith fails to meet the P1 response or resolution targets for more than **two (2)** P1 incidents in any calendar quarter, Contoso shall be entitled to a Service Credit equal to **5%** of the quarterly portion of Maintenance Fees.  

12.3.2 Service Credits shall be applied against future Maintenance Fees or, if this Maintenance Agreement is not renewed and no further Maintenance Fees are payable, against subscription fees under the Parent Agreement, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

### 12.4 Escalation and Chronic Service Failures

12.4.1 If Service Failures occur repeatedly (e.g., failure to meet availability targets or P1 response/resolution targets for three or more months in a rolling six-month period), the Parties shall escalate the matter to senior management under the dispute resolution framework in **Article XIV** of the Parent Agreement and this Maintenance Agreement.

12.4.2 The Parties shall jointly develop a remediation plan with specific, time-bound corrective actions. Zenith shall implement such remediation plan at its own cost unless the Service Failures are materially contributed to by Contoso’s acts or omissions.

12.4.3 If, after implementation of the remediation plan, Service Failures continue at a materially similar rate for an additional three (3) consecutive months, Contoso may, in addition to its other rights, **terminate this Maintenance Agreement for cause** upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, without early termination fees and with a commercially reasonable pro rata refund of prepaid, unused Maintenance Fees.
