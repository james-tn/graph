### 9.2 Liability Cap – Amendment-Specific Clarification

9.2.1 The overall liability cap established in **Section 9.2** of the Parent Agreement remains in effect; however, for purposes of clarity and negotiation balance given the **medium** risk profile of this Amendment, the Parties agree that, **solely with respect to claims arising exclusively from this Amendment**, the aggregate liability of each Party shall not exceed **two (2) times** the total Fees actually paid or payable by Contoso to Zenith under this Amendment during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

9.2.2 The foregoing Amendment-specific cap shall be read consistently with the exceptions set forth in **Section 9.2** of the Parent Agreement (indemnification, confidentiality breaches, IP infringement, gross negligence, or willful misconduct). For such excepted categories, the limitations in Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement (three times total Fees under the Agreement) shall continue to apply.

### 9.3 Allocation of Risk

9.3.1 The Parties acknowledge that the pricing and Revised Contract Value for this Amendment take into account the risk allocation reflected in **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement and this Article IX of the Amendment and that such limitations are reasonable and appropriate for a medium-risk engagement.
