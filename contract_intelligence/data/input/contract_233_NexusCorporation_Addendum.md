## ARTICLE III  
## FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Addendum Contract Value.**  

3.1.1 The total estimated contract value associated with the Additional Premises and Addendum Services over the Addendum Term is **US$1,572,478** (the “**Addendum Contract Value**”). This figure:

  (a) Is in addition to the **Contract Value of US$1,861,228** set forth in **Section 3.1 of the Parent Agreement**;  
  (b) Includes estimated base rent, standard service fees, and anticipated charges under this Addendum as of the Addendum Effective Date; and  
  (c) Excludes Taxes, pass-through expenses, and fees for future optional supplemental services not yet ordered by Contoso.

3.1.2 For clarity, the Addendum Contract Value is an estimate only and does not constitute a fee cap or commitment by Contoso to a minimum spend, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Addendum or the Parent Agreement.

3.2 **Base Rent and Service Fees under Addendum.**

3.2.1 **Base Rent for Additional Premises.** In addition to the **US$52,000.00 per month** Base Rent payable under **Section 3.2.1 of the Parent Agreement** for the Existing Premises, Contoso shall pay to Nexus a monthly base rent for the Additional Premises (the “**Addendum Base Rent**”) as follows:

  (a) For the 6th Floor Expansion Space: **US$24,000.00 per month**;  
  (b) For the 7th Floor reconfigured areas: included within the existing Base Rent, but subject to an incremental **US$3,500.00 per month** to account for increased technical infrastructure and mechanical capacity; and  
  (c) For the 8th Floor Technical and Staging Areas: **US$11,000.00 per month**.

Accordingly, the total Addendum Base Rent initially equals **US$38,500.00 per month**, resulting in a combined monthly base rent for the Total Premises of **US$90,500.00** as of the Addendum Effective Date.

3.2.2 **Annual Escalations.** The Addendum Base Rent will be subject to the same **3% annual escalation** on each anniversary of the **Effective Date of the Parent Agreement** (February 17 of each year), as set forth in **Section 3.2.1 of the Parent Agreement**, unless the Parties expressly agree in writing to a different escalation for Addendum Base Rent.

3.2.3 **Standard Services Fee.** In addition to the **US$9,500.00** monthly standard services fee payable under **Section 3.2.2 of the Parent Agreement**, Contoso shall pay an incremental standard services fee of **US$7,250.00 per month** for the Additional Premises, covering building services, standard connectivity, and facilities management applicable to such Additional Premises. The combined standard services fee for the Total Premises shall therefore initially be **US$16,750.00 per month**, subject to CPI or other index-based adjustments if agreed in a future SOW.

3.2.4 **Project Work and Supplemental Services.** Fees for Project Work and any supplemental services related to the Additional Premises (custom build-out, enhanced security, specialized cleaning, etc.) shall be:

  (a) As set forth in one or more SOWs referencing the Parent Agreement and this Addendum; or  
  (b) If no SOW is used, at cost plus **10% administrative fee**, consistent with **Section 3.6 of the Parent Agreement**, provided such expenses are pre-approved in writing by Contoso.

3.3 **Invoicing and Payment Terms (Net 60).**

3.3.1 **Invoicing.** Nexus shall invoice Contoso for the Addendum Base Rent and Addendum standard services fee on a monthly basis in advance, and for Project Work and other variable or usage-based charges in arrears, in each case consistent with the invoicing practices described in **Section 3.3.1 of the Parent Agreement**.

3.3.2 **Payment Terms – Net 60.** Notwithstanding **Section 3.3.2 (Net 45) of the Parent Agreement**, the Parties agree that, solely with respect to invoices issued under this Addendum, Contoso shall pay all undisputed Addendum Fees within **sixty (60) days** from the invoice date (“**Net 60**”).

3.3.3 **Disputed Amounts.** Dispute procedures in **Section 3.3.3 of the Parent Agreement** apply to invoices under this Addendum, except that Contoso shall provide written notice of any dispute within **twenty (20) days** of the invoice date for Addendum-related charges.

3.4 **Late Payments.**

3.4.1 **Interest.** Undisputed Addendum Fees not paid when due shall accrue interest at the rate specified in **Section 3.4.1 of the Parent Agreement** (the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law) from the due date until paid.

3.4.2 **Suspension Rights.** Nexus may exercise its suspension and restriction rights described in **Section 3.4.2 of the Parent Agreement** with respect to Addendum Services if Addendum-related invoices remain unpaid in accordance with the timelines set forth in that section.

3.5 **Taxes; Withholding; Reimbursement.**

3.5.1 All Addendum Fees are exclusive of Taxes. Contoso shall be responsible for Taxes as described in **Section 3.5 (Taxes)** of the Parent Agreement, as applied to Addendum Fees.

3.5.2 Reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses related to Project Work under this Addendum shall follow **Section 3.6 (Expenses and Reimbursement)** of the Parent Agreement.

## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (ADDENDUM-SPECIFIC)

9.1 **Medium-Risk Allocation; Liability Cap.**  

Notwithstanding **Article IX of the Parent Agreement**, and solely with respect to claims, damages, and liabilities arising under or in connection with this Addendum and the Additional Premises and Addendum Services:

9.1.1 The total aggregate liability of each Party to the other (and their respective Affiliates) for all claims arising in any **twelve (12) month period** shall be **capped at an amount equal to the Addendum Fees actually paid by Contoso to Nexus under this Addendum during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim** (or, if the Addendum has been in effect for less than twelve (12) months, the Fees paid during such shorter period, annualized).

9.1.2 This liability cap applies to all causes of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, and regardless of the legal theory.

9.2 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.** In addition, and again solely with respect to this Addendum:

9.2.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, **neither Party shall be liable to the other for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages**, or for loss of profits, business interruption, or loss of data, arising out of or relating to this Addendum, whether or not the Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9.2.2 The foregoing exclusion shall not limit the recoverability of direct damages that include amounts attributable to Third-Party Claims, indemnifiable under Article VIII, to the extent such damages are not otherwise excluded hereunder.

9.3 **Exceptions to Limitations.** The limitations and exclusions in this Article IX shall not apply to:

9.3.1 A Party’s indemnification obligations with respect to Third-Party Claims under **Article VIII** of this Addendum;  

9.3.2 A Party’s breach of its obligations under **Article V (Confidentiality)** or **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)** to the extent such breach results in a Data Breach as defined in the Parent Agreement;  

9.3.3 A Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or  

9.3.4 Contoso’s obligation to pay Addendum Fees and Taxes.

9.4 **Relationship to Parent Agreement.** For clarity, the uncapped liability regime in **Article IX of the Parent Agreement** continues to apply to claims solely arising under the Parent Agreement and Existing Premises and Services.
