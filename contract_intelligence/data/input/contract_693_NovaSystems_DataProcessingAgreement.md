## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Controller–Processor Relationship.** For purposes of Applicable Data Protection Laws, Contoso acts as Controller (or Business) and Nova acts as Processor (or Service Provider) with respect to Personal Data Processed in connection with the Services, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.** Nova shall Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by applicable law. In such case, Nova shall inform Contoso of that legal requirement before Processing, unless the law prohibits such disclosure.

11.3 **Compliance with Laws.** Each Party shall comply with its respective obligations under Applicable Data Protection Laws. Contoso is responsible for providing any required notices to Data Subjects and obtaining any required consents, authorizations, or permissions for Nova’s Processing of Personal Data in accordance with this Agreement.

11.4 **Security Measures.** Nova shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures shall include, at a minimum:

  (a) encryption of Personal Data in transit over public networks and at rest where commercially reasonable;

  (b) access controls, including role-based access and multi-factor authentication for administrative access;

  (c) regular security testing, vulnerability management, and patching;

  (d) logging and monitoring of key systems;

  (e) personnel security, including background checks where permitted and confidentiality agreements.

11.5 **Subprocessors.** Contoso hereby authorizes Nova to engage Subprocessors to Process Personal Data in connection with the Services, provided that:

  (a) Nova shall enter into written agreements with Subprocessors that impose data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth herein;

  (b) Nova shall remain fully liable for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors;

  (c) Nova shall maintain an up-to-date list of Subprocessors and, upon Contoso’s written request, shall provide such list to Contoso. Where required by law, Nova shall provide Contoso with advance notice of any new Subprocessor.

11.6 **International Transfers.** To the extent Nova transfers Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland to a country that does not provide an adequate level of data protection (as determined by the European Commission or relevant authority), Nova shall ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, such as the execution of standard contractual clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms.

11.7 **Data Subject Rights.** Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Nova shall assist Contoso, to a reasonable extent and at Contoso’s cost, in responding to Data Subject requests to exercise rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws (e.g., access, rectification, deletion, portability). Nova shall promptly notify Contoso of any Data Subject request it receives directly relating to Personal Data Processed under this Agreement and shall not respond to such request except on documented instructions from Contoso, unless required by law.

11.8 **Data Breach Notification.** Nova shall notify Contoso without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after discovery, of any Data Breach affecting Personal Data Processed under this Agreement. Such notice shall include, to the extent known: (a) the nature of the breach; (b) the categories and approximate number of Data Subjects and records affected; (c) the likely consequences; and (d) measures taken or proposed to address and mitigate the breach. Nova shall reasonably cooperate with Contoso in investigating, mitigating, and remediating the Data Breach, and in complying with any breach notification obligations under Applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.9 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Nova shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by law. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, and at Contoso’s written request, Nova shall delete or return Personal Data as described in Section 4.6, subject to any legal retention obligations.

11.10 **Audits.** Upon reasonable prior written notice and no more than once per calendar year (unless required by a supervisory authority or following a Data Breach), Contoso may, at its expense, conduct an audit of Nova’s compliance with this Article XI. Such audit may be conducted by Contoso or a third-party auditor selected by Contoso and reasonably acceptable to Nova, and shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Nova’s operations and protects the confidentiality and security of Nova’s other customers and information. Nova may, in lieu of an on-site audit, provide third-party certifications or audit reports (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001) that adequately demonstrate compliance.
