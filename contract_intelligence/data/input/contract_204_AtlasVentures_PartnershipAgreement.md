## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its processing of Personal Data under this Agreement. Where Atlas processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso, Atlas shall be deemed a “processor” (or “service provider” under the CCPA), and Contoso shall be deemed a “controller” (or “business” under the CCPA).

11.2 **Processing Instructions.**  
Atlas shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a Third Country or international organization, unless required to do so by applicable law. In such case, Atlas shall inform Contoso of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
Atlas shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing.

11.4 **Data Breach.**  
In the event of any actual or suspected unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personal Data processed by Atlas under this Agreement (“**Data Breach**”), Atlas shall:  
  (a) notify Contoso without undue delay and, in any event, within seventy-two (72) hours of becoming aware of the Data Breach;  
  (b) provide Contoso with sufficient information to enable Contoso to meet any obligations to report or inform data subjects or regulators of the Data Breach;  
  (c) cooperate with Contoso in investigating and mitigating the Data Breach; and  
  (d) implement reasonable remedial measures to prevent a recurrence.

11.5 **Subprocessors.**  
Atlas shall not engage any subprocessor to process Personal Data on behalf of Contoso without Contoso’s prior written authorization, which may be general or specific. Where authorized, Atlas shall impose data protection obligations on such subprocessor that are at least as protective as those set forth in this Agreement, and Atlas shall remain fully liable for the acts and omissions of any subprocessor.

11.6 **Data Subject Requests.**  
Atlas shall, to the extent reasonably possible and taking into account the nature of the processing, assist Contoso in responding to data subject requests under Data Protection Laws (including requests for access, correction, deletion, or portability), provided that Atlas shall not respond directly to any such request unless instructed by Contoso or required by law.

11.7 **Cross-Border Transfers.**  
To the extent Atlas transfers Personal Data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland to a country that is not recognized as providing an adequate level of protection, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, as required by applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Atlas shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Contoso’s written request, Atlas shall delete or return all Personal Data to Contoso and delete any existing copies, unless applicable law requires storage of such Personal Data.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Availability.**  
To the extent Atlas provides any continuous or recurring managed services or hosted components as part of the Services (“**Managed Services**”), Atlas shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such Managed Services are available **99.9%** of the time in any given calendar month, excluding:  
  (a) scheduled maintenance (not to exceed five (5) hours per month and to occur during off-peak hours with at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior notice);  
  (b) emergency maintenance; and  
  (c) downtime caused by Force Majeure Events or Contoso-controlled systems.

12.2 **Response and Resolution Times.**  
Atlas shall respond to and work to resolve support requests related to the Managed Services according to the following targets:  

- **Severity 1 (Critical)**: Response within 2 hours; continuous efforts to resolve until service is restored or workaround implemented.  
- **Severity 2 (High)**: Response within 4 Business Hours; reasonable efforts to resolve within 1 Business Day.  
- **Severity 3 (Medium)**: Response within 1 Business Day; reasonable efforts to resolve within 3 Business Days.  
- **Severity 4 (Low)**: Response within 2 Business Days; resolution on best-efforts basis.

12.3 **Service Credits.**  
If Atlas fails to meet the availability target in **Section 12.1** for any calendar month, Contoso shall be entitled to service credits as follows (calculated as a percentage of the monthly fees attributable to the affected Managed Services):  

- Availability **< 99.9% and ≥ 99.0%**: 5% credit  
- Availability **< 99.0% and ≥ 98.0%**: 10% credit  
- Availability **< 98.0%**: 15% credit  

Service credits shall be applied against the next invoice(s) issued by Atlas. Service credits shall be Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy for SLA-related issues, except where such failure constitutes a material breach giving rise to termination rights under **Section 4.4**.

12.4 **Reporting and Measurement.**  
Atlas shall maintain sufficient logs and records to measure compliance with the Service Levels and shall provide monthly SLA reports to Contoso upon request. Any disputes regarding Service Level measurements shall be resolved pursuant to **Article XIV (Dispute Resolution)**.

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  
Either Party may propose changes to the scope, Deliverables, timelines, or other aspects of the Services (“**Change Request**”). Change Requests shall be submitted in writing, describing the proposed change and its rationale.

13.2 **Change Orders.**  
If the Parties agree to implement a Change Request, they shall memorialize the agreed changes in a written Change Order, signed by authorized representatives of both Parties, which shall specify:  
  (a) the nature and scope of the change;  
  (b) any impact on fees or Contract Value;  
  (c) any impact on timelines or milestones; and  
  (d) any required adjustments to Service Levels or acceptance criteria.  

Each Change Order shall be deemed incorporated into this Agreement upon execution.

13.3 **Effect of Changes.**  
Atlas shall not be obligated to perform any changes to the Services unless and until a Change Order has been fully executed. Contoso shall not be liable for any additional fees or expenses arising from changes not documented in a Change Order.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  
In the event of any Dispute, the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the matter through good-faith negotiations between operational representatives. If the Dispute is not resolved within fifteen (15) Business Days, either Party may escalate the Dispute to senior executives of each Party for further negotiation.

14.2 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute remains unresolved after escalation for an additional thirty (30) days, the Parties agree to attempt to settle the Dispute through non-binding mediation conducted in Dallas, Texas, before resorting to litigation or arbitration. The mediation shall be administered by a mutually agreed mediation provider, and the Parties shall share the mediator’s fees and costs equally.

14.3 **Litigation; Venue.**  
If the Dispute has not been resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days of initiation, either Party may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to mandatory arbitration clauses (if any agreed separately), the Parties agree that the state and federal courts located in Dallas County, Texas shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any such actions, and each Party hereby irrevocably submits to such jurisdiction and venue.

14.4 **Interim Relief.**  
Nothing in this Article shall prevent either Party from seeking interim or injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm, including for actual or threatened breaches of **Article V (Confidentiality)** or **Article VI (Intellectual Property Rights)**.

15.2 **Notice and Mitigation.**  
The affected Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its effects and resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable.

15.3 **Suspension of Obligations.**  
During the pendency of a Force Majeure Event, the affected Party’s obligations under this Agreement shall be suspended to the extent and for the duration that performance is prevented by the Force Majeure Event, provided the affected Party is using commercially reasonable efforts to overcome the event.

15.4 **Termination for Prolonged Force Majeure.**  
If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, either Party may terminate the affected portion of this Agreement upon written notice to the other Party, without liability (other than for fees due for Services performed prior to the effective date of termination).
