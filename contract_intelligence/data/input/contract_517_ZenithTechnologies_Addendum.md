## SCOPE OF SERVICES AND LICENSE EXPANSION

### 2.1 Reference to Parent Agreement Scope

2.1.1 The Parties acknowledge and agree that the **Scope of Services and License** under **Article II** of the Parent Agreement remains in full force and effect. This Addendum **supplements** such scope solely with respect to the expansion of the licensed user base and the addition of modules, as set forth herein.

2.1.2 By way of reference, under **Section 2.2.1** of the Parent Agreement, Zenith grants to Contoso a non-exclusive, non-transferable license for Contoso’s internal business operations, and under **Section 2.2.2**, such license is limited to **250 named Authorized Users**. This Addendum expands that limitation and adds modules, but does not otherwise alter the nature of the license grant, which remains revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable (except as permitted under Section 16.7 of the Parent Agreement).

### 2.2 License Expansion – Additional Authorized Users

2.2.1 As of the Addendum Effective Date, and subject to Contoso’s timely payment of all Addendum Fees, Zenith hereby grants to Contoso, during the Expanded Subscription Term, a license under the same terms and conditions as set forth in **Section 2.2** of the Parent Agreement to permit additional named Authorized Users to access and use the Software.

2.2.2 The Parties agree that, in addition to the 250 named Authorized Users previously licensed under the Parent Agreement, Contoso is hereby licensed for an additional **1,250 named Authorized Users**, for a total of **1,500 named Authorized Users** licensed under the combined scope of the Parent Agreement and this Addendum.

2.2.3 The Parties expressly agree that **Section 2.2.2** of the Parent Agreement is hereby **amended and superseded** solely with respect to the total number of Authorized Users, such that the reference to “up to 250 named Authorized Users” is revised to read:

> “Unless otherwise set forth in an SOW, amendment, or addendum (including, without limitation, Addendum Ref. ADD-ZEN-202502-517), the license is limited to the number of named Authorized Users purchased by Contoso, which, as of the date of Addendum Ref. ADD-ZEN-202502-517, is **1,500 named Authorized Users** in the aggregate.”

2.2.4 Any use of the Software beyond the total of 1,500 named Authorized Users shall require Contoso to purchase additional licenses via a subsequent SOW, amendment, or addendum, in accordance with Zenith’s then-current rate schedule and the change management process in **Article XIII** of the Parent Agreement.

### 2.3 License Expansion – Additional Modules

2.3.1 In addition to the modules of the ZenithOps Suite initially licensed under the Parent Agreement (including **Analytics**, **Workflow**, **Integration Hub**, and **Administration Console**), Contoso desires to license, and Zenith agrees to provide, the following **Additional Modules** for Contoso’s internal business use:

  (a) **Advanced Predictive Analytics Module** (expansion of Analytics);

  (c) **Global Integration Hub Extensions** (expanded connectors to third-party CRM, ERP, and identity management systems);  
  (d) **Security & Compliance Console** (advanced audit, role-based access governance, and compliance reporting);  
  (e) **Mobile Workforce Module** (mobile access and offline synchronization capabilities); and  
  (f) any ancillary sub-modules, connectors, or features expressly identified in any exhibit to this Addendum.

2.3.2 Subject to Contoso’s payment of the applicable Addendum Fees, Zenith grants to Contoso, during the Expanded Subscription Term, a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as permitted under Section 16.7 of the Parent Agreement), non-sublicensable right to access and use the Additional Modules, only (a) in conjunction with the existing licensed modules of the Software; and (b) for Contoso’s and its Authorized Users’ internal business operations.

2.3.3 The use of any Additional Modules shall be subject to the same **Restrictions on Use** set forth in **Section 2.6** of the Parent Agreement, including prohibitions on copying, modifying, reverse engineering, or using the Software as a service bureau.

### 2.4 Professional Services and Implementation for Additions

2.4.1 To support the onboarding of the Additional Authorized Users and Additional Modules, Zenith shall perform additional professional Services, which shall be deemed Services under **Section 2.3** of the Parent Agreement and subject to **Article II** and **Article XII** (SLA) thereof. These Services may include:

  (a) onboarding and provisioning of up to 1,250 additional Authorized Users;  
  (b) configuration and deployment of the Additional Modules in Contoso’s existing hosted instance of ZenithOps Suite;  
  (c) extension of existing integrations (as contemplated in **Section 2.3.1(c)** of the Parent Agreement) to accommodate new modules and user roles;  
  (d) additional training for Contoso’s personnel specific to the new modules and expanded user base; and  
  (e) performance tuning and capacity planning to support the increased user load.

2.4.2 The Parties anticipate that the incremental implementation work under this Addendum will be conducted in phases similar to those described in **Section 2.4.1** of the Parent Agreement (Discovery & Design, Configuration & Integration, UAT & Training, Go-Live & Stabilization), but with timeframes and milestones scaled to the expanded scope. The detailed project plan, including estimated timelines and milestones, may be set forth in one or more SOWs referencing both the Parent Agreement and this Addendum.

2.4.3 Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the Services under this Addendum shall be deemed accepted in accordance with the **Acceptance** provisions of **Section 2.7** of the Parent Agreement.

### 2.5 Performance Standards

2.5.1 Zenith shall perform all Services and provide access to the Software and Additional Modules under this Addendum in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with the performance standards set forth in **Section 2.5** of the Parent Agreement and the SLA in **Article XII** thereof.

2.5.2 Contoso acknowledges that, consistent with **Section 2.5.3** of the Parent Agreement, the performance and efficacy of the expanded deployment depend in part on the accuracy of Contoso’s data, the availability of Contoso’s systems, and Contoso’s timely decisions and approvals.
