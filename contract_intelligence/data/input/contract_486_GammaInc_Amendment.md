  (b) Vendor’s breach of **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)** or **Article V (Confidentiality)**; or  
  (c) Vendor’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of the Services.

8.2 **Client Indemnification.** Client shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Vendor and its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, the **“Vendor Indemnified Parties”**) from and against any Claims and related liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses arising out of or relating to:

  (a) Client’s breach of applicable laws in connection with the use of the Services or Deliverables;  
  (b) Client’s provision or use of Client Materials or Client Data that infringes third‑party rights; or  
  (c) Client’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

8.3 **Indemnification Procedures.** The obligations of the indemnifying Party under this **Article VIII** are conditioned upon the indemnified Party:

  (a) promptly providing written notice of the Claim;  
  (b) granting the indemnifying Party sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim (provided that no settlement may impose any admission of liability, obligation, or restriction on the indemnified Party without its prior written consent); and  
  (c) providing reasonable assistance at the indemnifying Party’s expense.

8.4 **Mitigation.** In the event of an infringement Claim under Section 8.1(a), Vendor may, at its sole option and expense, (i) procure for Client the right to continue using the Services or Deliverables, (ii) modify the Services or Deliverables so that they become non‑infringing, or (iii) replace the Services or Deliverables with a non‑infringing alternative having substantially equivalent functionality. If none of the foregoing options is reasonably available, Client may terminate the affected Services or SOW and Vendor shall refund any prepaid, unused fees.

## ARTICLE XI  
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with the collection, processing, and transfer of Client Data under the Agreement, including any regulations or guidance issued by relevant regulatory authorities.

11.2 **Role of the Parties.** To the extent Data Protection Laws classify the roles of the Parties, Client shall be deemed the “controller” (or equivalent term) of Client Data, and Vendor shall be deemed the “processor” (or equivalent term) acting on behalf of Client, unless otherwise required by law.

11.3 **Processing of Client Data.** Vendor shall:

  (a) process Client Data only on documented instructions from Client, including as described in the Agreement, except as required by law;  
  (b) ensure that persons authorized to process Client Data are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations;  
  (c) implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Client Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access; and  
  (d) not transfer Client Data outside the jurisdiction specified by Client without Client’s prior written approval and subject to appropriate transfer mechanisms (e.g., standard contractual clauses) as required by Data Protection Laws.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Vendor may engage Subcontractors as subprocessors of Client Data, subject to:

  (a) Vendor entering into a written agreement with each subprocessor imposing data protection obligations at least as protective as those in this Article XI; and  
  (b) providing Client with a list of subprocessors upon request. Client may object on reasonable grounds to a proposed subprocessor, in which case the Parties will work in good faith to find an alternative.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of any Incident affecting Client Data:

  (a) Vendor shall notify Client without undue delay and, in any event, within seventy‑two (72) hours of becoming aware of the Incident;  
  (b) Vendor’s notice shall include, to the extent known at the time, a description of the nature of the Incident, the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records involved, the likely consequences, and the measures taken or proposed to address the Incident; and  
  (c) Vendor shall promptly investigate, mitigate, and remediate the Incident, and cooperate with Client and regulatory authorities as reasonably requested.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.** Vendor shall assist Client, to the extent reasonably necessary and at Client’s expense to the extent not caused by Vendor’s breach, in responding to data subject requests to exercise rights under applicable Data Protection Laws (e.g., access, rectification, deletion).

Upon Client’s written request or upon termination of the Agreement, Vendor shall, at Client’s option, delete or return all Client Data in its possession or control, except for archival copies retained for legal, regulatory, or backup purposes, which shall remain subject to the confidentiality and security obligations herein.

11.8 **Security Audits.** Upon reasonable prior notice and not more than once per year (unless an Incident has occurred), Client or its designated third‑party auditor may review Vendor’s relevant policies, certifications, or independent audit reports (such as SOC 2 or ISO 27001) relating to information security.

## ARTICLE XII  
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.2 **Response and Resolution Times.** Vendor shall respond to and use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve support requests based on the severity level assigned, as further detailed in a support schedule (e.g., Severity 1 – critical outage, initial response within 1 hour; Severity 2 – significant degradation, initial response within 4 hours).

12.3 **Service Credits.** In the event Vendor fails to meet the uptime or response time commitments, Client shall be entitled to service credits as specified in the SLA schedule, which may be applied against future invoices. Service credits are not punitive but constitute a reasonable estimate of Client’s damages for SLA breaches and shall not be deemed an exclusive remedy where repeated or material SLA breaches occur.

12.4 **Reporting.** Vendor shall provide monthly reports detailing uptime, incidents, and SLA performance. Persistent failure to meet SLA commitments may constitute a material breach under Section 4.5.

## ARTICLE XIII

  (b) By mutual agreement, the Parties may instead submit the Dispute to binding arbitration before a single arbitrator under the rules of a recognized arbitration organization, with the seat of arbitration in San Francisco, California.
