## ARTICLE IX. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

### 9.1 SOW‑Specific Liability Cap

Notwithstanding **Section 9.1 (No Cap; High‑Risk Engagement)** of the Parent Agreement, and specifically for this SOW only, the Parties agree—given the **low risk** profile of this engagement and the Parties’ mutual desire for Client‑friendly risk allocation—that:

- To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each Party’s aggregate liability to the other Party arising out of or relating to this SOW, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall be **capped at three (3) times the total Fees actually paid or payable by Contoso to Quantum Labs under this SOW during the twelve (12)‑month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim** (the **“SOW Liability Cap”**).

This SOW Liability Cap modifies the no‑cap arrangement in Section 9.1 of the Parent Agreement solely with respect to claims arising under or in connection with this SOW. The cap shall not apply to the extent prohibited by law.

### 9.2 Exclusion of Certain Damages

Consistent with **Section 9.2 (Consequential and Other Damages)** of the Parent Agreement, and subject to the exceptions below, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages (including lost profits, loss of business, or loss of data), arising out of or related to this SOW, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

### 9.3 Exceptions to Limitations

The exclusions and limitations in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 of this SOW shall **not** apply to:

- A Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under **Article V** of the Parent Agreement or this SOW;  
- A Party’s breach of its data protection and privacy obligations under **Article XI** of the Parent Agreement or this SOW;  
- A Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII** of the Parent Agreement with respect to third‑party claims arising from this SOW; or  
- Quantum Labs’ liability for its gross negligence or willful misconduct, consistent with **Section 9.2(c)** of the Parent Agreement.

In such cases, liability shall still be subject to any non‑waivable legal limitations, but the SOW Liability Cap and exclusion of consequential damages shall not apply to the extent set forth above.

---

## ARTICLE X. INSURANCE

Consistent with **Article X (Insurance)** of the Parent Agreement, Quantum Labs shall maintain the insurance coverage described therein throughout the SOW Term. Upon Contoso’s reasonable written request, Quantum Labs shall provide certificates of insurance evidencing such coverage, identifying this SOW (SOW‑QUA‑202408‑130) and the Parent Agreement (CSA‑QUA‑202408‑108).

---

## ARTICLE XI. DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

### 11.1 Reference to Parent Agreement

Data protection and privacy obligations are governed by **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)** of the Parent Agreement. This Article XI of the SOW supplements those obligations, particularly in relation to the Project’s data and AI components.

### 11.2 Nature of Data Processing under this SOW

The Parties anticipate that Quantum Labs may process **Client Personal Data** (as defined in the Parent Agreement) and other Client data in connection with:

- Building and validating AI/analytics models;  
- Populating the Data Platform;  
- Testing and validating data pipelines; and  
- Providing advisory and support services.

Quantum Labs shall act as a **processor** and Contoso as **controller**, consistent with **Section 11.1** of the Parent Agreement.

### 11.3 Data Minimization and Segregation

Quantum Labs shall use data minimization principles, processing only such Client Personal Data as is reasonably necessary to perform the Services. Where possible, Quantum Labs will use pseudonymized or anonymized data in Sandbox Environments.

### 11.4 Data Breach

Data Breach notification and response shall be handled in accordance with **Section 11.4 (Data Breach Notification)** of the Parent Agreement. Quantum Labs shall ensure that any Subprocessors used in connection with this SOW are covered under its breach response processes.

### 11.5 Data Retention and Deletion

Except as otherwise agreed, Quantum Labs shall retain Project‑related Client Personal Data only for the duration of the SOW Term and any legally required retention period. Upon Contoso’s written request or upon termination/expiration of this SOW, Quantum Labs shall return or securely delete such data in accordance with **Section 11.5 (Data Retention and Deletion)** of the Parent Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE XII. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

### 12.1 Applicability

To the extent Quantum Labs provides any hosted or managed components (e.g., staging of the Data Platform, sandbox or model‑serving environments) under this SOW, the generic Service Levels in **Article XII** of the Parent Agreement shall apply, supplemented as follows.

### 12.2 Uptime Commitment (SOW‑Specific)

Quantum Labs shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any hosted staging or sandbox environments directly managed by Quantum Labs under this SOW are available **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding:

- Planned maintenance (with at least forty‑eight (48) hours’ prior notice); and  
- Force Majeure Events as defined in **Article XV** of the Parent Agreement and this SOW.

This is consistent with, and not less protective than, **Section 12.1** of the Parent Agreement.

### 12.3 Incident Response

Incident severity and response targets shall follow **Section 12.2 (Incident Response Times)** of the Parent Agreement. The Parties may refine classification criteria in the Project Plan.

### 12.4 Service Credits

Service credits for failure to meet uptime commitments shall be as described in **Section 12.3** of the Parent Agreement. Any service credits arising from hosted environments for this SOW shall be applied against future invoices for this SOW only.

## ARTICLE XIV. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Disputes arising under this SOW shall follow the dispute resolution procedures in **Article XIV (Dispute Resolution)** of the Parent Agreement, including negotiation, escalation to senior executives, mediation in Wilmington, Delaware, and litigation in state or federal courts located in Delaware.

The Parties agree that disputes specifically concerning Acceptance Criteria, Change Orders, or technical performance issues shall first be escalated to the Project Steering Committee before invoking formal dispute resolution, unless immediate relief is required under **Section 14.4 (Interim Relief)** of the Parent Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE XV. FORCE MAJEURE

Force Majeure Events and related rights and obligations shall be governed by **Article XV (Force Majeure)** of the Parent Agreement. Each Party shall promptly notify the other in writing upon becoming aware of any Force Majeure Event that materially affects performance under this SOW and will use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its impact.
