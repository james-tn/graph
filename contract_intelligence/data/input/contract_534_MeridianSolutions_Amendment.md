### SCOPE OF SERVICES / WORK

2.1 **General Scope.** Meridian shall provide to Contoso comprehensive professional, technology implementation, and managed services intended to design, implement, stabilize, and support Contoso’s enterprise data integration, analytics, and operations management platform (the **“Program”**).

2.2.1 **Assessment and Design.** Meridian shall perform an initial assessment of Contoso’s current systems, processes, and data flows, including onsite and remote discovery sessions, stakeholder interviews, review of existing technical documentation, and collection of business requirements.

2.2.2 **Implementation and Configuration.** Meridian shall implement and configure the agreed solution, including:

  (a) data integration and ETL pipeline setup;  
  (b) configuration of analytic dashboards and reporting;  
  (c) implementation of role‑based access controls;  
  (d) configuration of alerting, monitoring, and logging; and  
  (e) migration of legacy data or systems to the new platform, to the extent expressly set forth in the relevant SOW.

2.2.3 **Custom Development.** Where standard configuration is not sufficient to meet the agreed business requirements, Meridian may, subject to an applicable SOW or Change Order, perform limited custom development, including scripts, connectors, or utilities. All such custom development shall be deemed Work Product and shall be governed by Article VI.

2.2.4 **Testing and Acceptance.** Meridian shall perform unit, integration, and system testing in accordance with a test plan referenced in the applicable SOW. Contoso shall conduct user acceptance testing (**“UAT”**) within the timeframe specified in the applicable SOW. Unless Contoso provides written rejection with reasonable detail of the non‑conformities within such timeframe, the applicable Deliverable shall be deemed accepted. Partial acceptance may be agreed through written correspondence if a Deliverable substantially conforms except for minor defects that do not materially impair its intended use.

2.2.5 **Training and Knowledge Transfer.** Meridian shall provide training sessions to Contoso’s designated personnel, covering operation of the implemented solution, routine administrative tasks, escalation procedures, and reporting capabilities. Training may be conducted on‑site or remotely, as specified in the SOW. Meridian shall also supply reasonable documentation, including user guides or runbooks, as part of the Deliverables.

2.2.6 **Managed Services and Support.** Following acceptance of the core solution, Meridian shall provide managed services, including system monitoring, incident response, patching, configuration adjustments, and performance optimization, in accordance with the Service Levels set forth in Article XII. Meridian shall designate a service delivery manager as primary point of contact for the managed services.

2.2.7 **Advisory Services.** Meridian may, upon Contoso’s request and subject to applicable fees, provide strategic advisory services, including roadmap planning, performance assessments, security best practices, and regulatory compliance guidance related to the Program.

2.3 **Deliverables.** The Deliverables to be provided by Meridian under this Amendment shall include, at a minimum:

  (a) Solution Design documentation;  
  (b) Implementation plan and project schedule;  
  (c) Configured production and pre‑production environments as specified in the SOW;

2.4 **Performance Standards.** Meridian shall perform the Services:

  (a) in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with generally accepted industry standards for similarly complex technology deployments;  
  (b) in accordance with the Project Plan and Milestones described in the applicable SOW, subject to any adjustments under Article XIII (Change Management);  
  (c) using personnel who are appropriately skilled and experienced for the tasks assigned; and  
  (d) in compliance with Applicable Laws, including applicable data protection and privacy laws, as further detailed in Article XI.

2.5 **Contoso Responsibilities.** Meridian’s obligations are conditioned upon Contoso’s timely performance of the following responsibilities:

  (a) providing accurate and complete business requirements, access to relevant personnel, systems, and facilities;  
  (b) designating a primary project manager and subject matter experts to participate in workshops, testing, and approvals;  
  (c) reviewing and providing feedback on Deliverables within the timelines specified in the SOW;  
  (d) securing and maintaining any third‑party licenses or approvals necessary for integration with Contoso’s other systems, unless expressly agreed otherwise; and  
  (e) ensuring timely payment of all invoices in accordance with Article III.

Any failure by Contoso to perform its obligations shall entitle Meridian to an equitable adjustment to timelines, Milestones, and fees to the extent such failure impacts the Services.

2.6 **Subcontracting.** Meridian may subcontract portions of the Services to qualified third parties, provided that Meridian shall remain fully responsible for the performance of such subcontractors and their compliance with the relevant terms of this Amendment, including confidentiality and data protection obligations. Upon written request, Meridian shall provide Contoso with a list of material subcontractors engaged in the performance of the Services.

2.7 **Statements of Work.** Specific details of certain Services, Deliverables, Milestones, and fees shall be set forth in one or more SOWs executed by the Parties. Each SOW shall reference the Original Agreement and this Amendment. In the event of any conflict between an SOW and this Amendment, this Amendment shall prevail unless the SOW expressly states that it is intended to supersede a specific provision herein.

12.5 **Reporting.** Meridian shall provide Contoso with periodic reports (at least monthly) summarizing service availability, incident statistics, and Service Level performance.
