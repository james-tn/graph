---

## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **General.**  
The Parties acknowledge that the Parent SOW is classified as “High” risk and therefore modifies liability in **Article IX of the Parent SOW** to remove the liability cap and the exclusion of consequential damages. However, this Work Order is classified as **Medium risk** under **Section 1.15** and the Parties accordingly agree to adopt a **balanced but capped** liability structure for this Work Order as set forth herein.

9.2 **Liability Cap for This Work Order.**  
(a) Notwithstanding **Article IX of the Parent SOW**, and except as set forth in **Section 9.4** below, the total aggregate liability of each Party to the other arising out of or in connection with this Work Order, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall be limited to an amount equal to **three (3) times the Fees paid and payable by Contoso to Acme under this Work Order during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.  
(b) For avoidance of doubt, this liability cap applies only to claims arising under or relating specifically to this Work Order, and does not alter the liability regime applicable to the Parent SOW unless expressly stated.

9.3 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  
(a) Except for the categories of claims identified in **Section 9.4**, neither Party shall be liable to the other Party for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, loss of revenue, or loss of business opportunity, arising out of or in connection with this Work Order, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.  
(b) This exclusion is intended to **reinstate**, for this Work Order, the general exclusion of consequential and special damages that is modified for the High-risk Parent SOW in **Section 9.2 of the Parent SOW**.

9.4 **Exceptions to Limitations.**  
The limitations and exclusions set forth in **Sections 9.2 and 9.3** shall not apply to:

(a) A Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII** for third-party claims involving (i) bodily injury, death, or tangible property damage, or (ii) infringement or misappropriation of third-party Intellectual Property Rights;  
(b) A Party’s breach of **Article V (Confidentiality)** or **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)**, to the extent such breach results in actual third-party claims or regulatory fines attributable to that Party;  
(c) A Party’s gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud; or  
(d) Any amounts expressly stated in this Work Order to be outside the limitation of liability.

9.5 **Risk Allocation.**  
The Parties acknowledge and agree that the limitations and exclusions set forth in this Article IX reflect a reasonable and negotiated allocation of risk, taking into account the **Medium** risk classification of this Work Order and the WO Contract Value, and that such limitations are an essential basis of the bargain between the Parties.
