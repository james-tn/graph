Except as expressly modified herein, the framework established by **Sections 2.1 through 2.10** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to the Additional Services and Additional Deliverables. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge that:

- The Additional Services are **“Services”** as defined in **Section 1.14** of the Parent Agreement, and

  (a) Fully assembled NG Series industrial equipment units meeting Contoso’s Specifications;  
  (b) Critical subassemblies (e.g., motion control modules, power modules, sensor assemblies);  
  (c) Test fixtures, diagnostic tools, and associated documentation, where funded as NRE under **Article III** of this Addendum;  
  (d) Technical documentation, including manufacturing process instructions, test reports, quality metrics, and failure analysis reports.

  - Reference the Parent Agreement by its contract reference number **PUR-TIT-202504-504** and internal identifier **contract_504**, and  
  - Reference this Addendum by its contract reference number **ADD-TIT-202504-611**.

Each Addendum SOW shall contain the elements required under **Section 2.2** of the Parent Agreement (description of Deliverables and Services, Specifications, schedule, pricing, acceptance criteria, etc.).

2.6 **Forecasts and Capacity for Additional Scope.** Consistent with **Section 2.4** of the Parent Agreement, Contoso shall provide rolling, good-faith non-binding Forecasts for the NG Series. Titan shall use commercially reasonable efforts to:

  - Reserve manufacturing and test capacity to meet such Forecasts; and  
  - Provide advance notice of any anticipated capacity constraints.

Any forecast commitment levels, minimum order quantities, capacity reservations, or related inventory liability specific to the NG Series shall be set forth in applicable Addendum SOWs, and **Section 3.9** of the Parent Agreement (Inventory and Cancellation Charges) shall apply to Excess Inventory associated with the Additional Deliverables.

2.7 **Orders and Acceptance; Title and Risk of Loss.** 

  (a) **Purchase Orders.** Contoso shall issue POs referencing both (i) the Parent Agreement (**PUR-TIT-202504-504**, contract_504) and (ii) this Addendum (**ADD-TIT-202504-611**) for all Additional Deliverables and Additional Services. Titan’s acceptance, rejection, and confirmation obligations remain governed by **Section 2.5** of the Parent Agreement.

  (b) **Delivery; Title and Risk of Loss.** Unless otherwise specified in an Addendum SOW, shipments of Additional Deliverables shall be **FOB Titan’s facility (Incoterms 2020)**, with title and risk of loss passing to Contoso upon delivery to the carrier, as provided in **Section 2.6** of the Parent Agreement.

  (c) **Inspection and Acceptance.** Contoso’s inspection and acceptance rights for Additional Deliverables shall be governed by **Section 2.7** of the Parent Agreement, including the **thirty (30) day Inspection Period**, the process for rejection of nonconforming Deliverables, and Titan’s repair/replace/refund obligations.

2.8 **Service Locations and Subcontractors.** The Additional Services shall be performed at Titan’s existing facilities and any other locations specified in Addendum SOWs, consistent with **Section 2.8** of the Parent Agreement. Titan’s use of subcontractors for the Additional Services shall be subject to **Section 2.9** of the Parent Agreement, with Titan remaining fully responsible for the acts and omissions of any subcontractors.

2.9 **Risk Profile for Additional Scope.** The Parties acknowledge that, while the Parent Agreement as a whole is characterized as **High risk** (see **Section 2.10** and **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement), the incremental scope under this Addendum is mutually agreed to be of **Medium Risk Profile**. Accordingly, **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)** of the Parent Agreement is modified for the purposes of this Addendum as set forth in **Article IX** of this Addendum only, providing a balanced liability cap and exclusion of consequential damages for this Additional scope.

## ARTICLE IX  
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (MODIFIED FOR THIS ADDENDUM)

9.1 **Modification of Parent Agreement Article IX for Additional Scope Only.** The Parties acknowledge that **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement provides for **no overall monetary cap** and allows recovery of both direct and consequential damages in light of the High risk profile. For the **Additional Services and Additional Deliverables under this Addendum only**, the Parties hereby agree to **replace** the provisions of **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement with the following provisions, which are more balanced and consistent with the **Medium Risk Profile** described in the Recitals and **Section 1.10** of this Addendum.

  (b) For purposes of this Section, fees “paid or payable” shall be calculated solely with respect to invoices issued under this Addendum (and not under other SOWs or the Parent Agreement generally).

9.4 **Exceptions to Limitations.** The limitations in **Sections 9.2** and **9.3** shall **not** apply to:

  (a) A Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII** of the Parent Agreement as applied to this Addendum;  

  (b) A Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under **Article V** of the Parent Agreement and **Article V** of this Addendum;  

  (c) A Party’s infringement or misappropriation of the other Party’s Intellectual Property rights; or  

  (d) A Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

9.5 **Allocation of Risk.** The Parties acknowledge that:

  - The Addendum Contract Value, pricing, and other terms herein reflect the allocation of risk contained in this **Article IX** for the Additional Services and Additional Deliverables; and  
  - Such allocation is an essential element of the bargain between the Parties with respect to this Addendum, and would be materially different in the absence of these limitations.

For clarity, **Article IX of the Parent Agreement remains in effect for all other Services and Deliverables not covered by this Addendum.**
