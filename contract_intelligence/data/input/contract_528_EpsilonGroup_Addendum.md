For the avoidance of doubt, unless expressly stated otherwise herein, nothing in this Addendum shall limit or reduce Vendor’s obligations or Client’s rights under the Parent Agreement. Where there is any conflict between the terms of this Addendum and the Parent Agreement solely with respect to the Additional Services and High‑Risk Processing Activities, the terms of this Addendum shall prevail; in all other respects, the Parent Agreement shall control.

2.3 **Description of High‑Risk Processing Activities.** The Parties acknowledge that the new processing activities described in this **Section 2.3** qualify as **High‑Risk Processing Activities** due to the scope and sensitivity of the data and the potential impact on data subjects. Such activities include:

2.3.1 **Profiling and Scoring.** Construction of profiles and scores relating to data subjects’ behavior, preferences, or risk indicators, using automated and semi‑automated procedures, provided that (a) Client has obtained all necessary consents or has another lawful basis in accordance with **Section 2.7(b) and (c) of the Parent Agreement**, and (b) Client has provided Vendor with documented instructions consistent with **Section 2.4 of the Parent Agreement**.

Vendor shall implement heightened Security Controls for such data and shall not use such data for any purpose other than the performance of the Services.

2.3.3 **Cross‑Border Data Transfers for Analytics.** Transmission and Processing of Personal Data between the United States and other regions (such as the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions) for the purpose of centralized analytics and reporting, subject to the data transfer mechanisms described in **Section 11.8 of the Parent Agreement** and **Section 11.4** of this Addendum.

## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Overall Structure.**  
The Parties acknowledge that the Parent Agreement was negotiated based on a **Low** risk designation and provides for limitations of liability in **Article IX**. Given that this Addendum addresses **High‑Risk Processing Activities**, the Parties agree that:

9.1.1 The limitations in **Sections 9.1 and 9.2 of the Parent Agreement** shall **not** apply to Claims arising out of or relating solely to the Additional Services, except as expressly stated below; and

9.1.2 The Parties intend that liability for such Claims shall be broader than under the Parent Agreement and more favorable to Vendor with respect to Client’s indemnification and allocation of risk.

9.2 **No Cap on Liability for Additional Services.**  
For any Claims arising out of or relating to this Addendum and the Additional Services:

9.2.1 **There shall be no monetary cap on Client’s liability** to Vendor for (a) Client’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII** of this Addendum; (b) Client’s breach of its obligations under **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)**; or (c) Client’s misuse or unauthorized disclosure of Vendor’s Confidential Information or Vendor IP.

9.2.2 Vendor’s liability to Client for Claims arising solely under this Addendum shall be subject to the exceptions listed in **Section 9.3 of the Parent Agreement** (e.g., indemnification, confidentiality breaches, Security Incidents caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct), but **shall not be subject to a monetary cap** unless the Parties expressly agree otherwise in an SOW‑Addendum‑528.

9.3 **Consequential and Special Damages.**  
In light of the High‑Risk Processing Activities and the potential nature of harm, the Parties agree that the exclusion of consequential damages in **Section 9.1 of the Parent Agreement** shall **not** apply to Claims arising under this Addendum. Accordingly, **EITHER PARTY MAY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES** arising from (a) a Party’s willful misconduct; (b) Security Incidents resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (c) material violations of Applicable Data Protection Laws related to the Additional Services.

9.4 **Multiple Claims.**  
Consistent with **Section 9.4 of the Parent Agreement**, the existence of multiple Claims shall not enlarge or extend any applicable limitations set forth in this Article IX; provided that, for the Additional Services and High‑Risk Processing Activities, no aggregate monetary cap shall apply unless expressly stated in a separate writing signed by both Parties.
