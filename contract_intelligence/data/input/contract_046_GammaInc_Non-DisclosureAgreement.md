Service Provider shall provide to the Company comprehensive technology consulting and implementation Services in connection with the design, development, deployment, and support of data analytics, integration, and reporting solutions (the **“Project”**). The Services are intended to enable the Company to securely ingest, process, and analyze large volumes of structured and unstructured data to support the Company’s strategic business operations. The Parties acknowledge that, due to the complexity and evolving nature of the Project, the scope may be refined by written amendments or separate statements of work (“SOWs”) incorporated by reference into this Agreement pursuant to **Article XIII**.

2.2 **Key Activities.**  
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Services shall include, at a minimum, the following categories of activities:

  2.2.1 **Requirements and Design.** Service Provider shall conduct discovery workshops, interviews, and documentation review to elicit detailed functional and technical requirements from the Company’s designated stakeholders. Service Provider shall then prepare and deliver a comprehensive solution design, including data architecture, integration design, security model, and high‑level system and process flows.

  2.2.2 **Data Integration and ETL.** Service Provider shall design, configure, and implement extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes, interfaces, and connectors necessary to integrate the Company’s designated source systems and third‑party platforms with the analytics environment. Service Provider will adhere to industry‑standard practices for data validation, reconciliation, and exception handling.

  2.2.3 **Analytics and Reporting.** Service Provider shall configure, customize, and deploy analytics dashboards, reports, and data visualizations in accordance with the Specifications. This may include creating KPIs, metrics, aggregations, drill‑downs, and access controls as required by the Company.

  2.2.4 **Security and Access Controls.** Service Provider shall implement role‑based access controls, encryption in transit and at rest (where technically feasible on the selected platforms), and logging and monitoring capabilities consistent with the Service Levels and Data Protection Laws, as further described in **Article XI**.

  2.2.5 **Testing and Acceptance Support.** Service Provider shall prepare test plans, test scripts, and test data and shall support the Company in performing unit testing, system integration testing, user acceptance testing, and performance testing.

  2.2.6 **Training and Knowledge Transfer.** Upon the Company’s reasonable request, Service Provider shall provide training sessions, workshops, and documentation to the Company’s designated personnel covering system usage, administration, and basic troubleshooting procedures.

Failure to timely provide such notice shall constitute deemed acceptance.

2.4 **Performance Standards.**  
Service Provider shall perform the Services: (a) in a professional, workmanlike manner consistent with industry standards for similar services; (b) by personnel who are appropriately skilled, experienced, and qualified; and (c) in material compliance with the Specifications and Service Levels. The Parties acknowledge, however, that the Services may involve complex third‑party systems and dependencies beyond Service Provider’s direct control, and, accordingly, Service Provider does not warrant that the Services or Deliverables will be error‑free or uninterrupted.

2.5 **Timelines and Milestones.**  
The Parties shall mutually agree upon high‑level timelines, milestones, and completion dates, which may be set forth in one or more SOWs or project plans.

In recognition of the high‑risk classification of this Agreement and the significant obligations undertaken by Service Provider, the Company agrees to the risk allocation provisions, including broad indemnification and uncapped liability as set forth in **Articles VIII and IX**, which are expressly negotiated and are integral to the Parties’ bargain.

THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT, IN LIGHT OF THE HIGH‑RISK NATURE OF THE SERVICES AND THE BARGAINED‑FOR RISK ALLOCATION, **THERE SHALL BE NO CONTRACTUAL CAP ON THE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY** ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.

9.2 **Consequential and Similar Damages (Included for High Risk).**  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in typical low‑risk agreements, and in recognition of the high‑risk classification, the Parties expressly agree that **NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE EXCLUDED FROM LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES**, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF DATA, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR NOT, AND EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. For the avoidance of doubt, such damages shall be recoverable to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law.

9.3 **Aggregation.**  
All claims arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be aggregated without limitation for purposes of determining the total liability of a Party hereunder, consistent with the absence of any limitation of liability cap under **Section 9.1**.

9.4 **Applicability.**  
The provisions of this **Article IX** shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law and shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.

10.3 **No Limitation.**  
The maintenance of insurance as required by this **Article X** shall not be construed to limit Service Provider’s liability under this Agreement, which remains uncapped as set forth in **Article IX**.

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all Data Protection Laws applicable to its processing of Personal Data under this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that, in the context of the Services, the Company shall generally act as a controller (or analogous term under Applicable Law) and Service Provider shall act as a processor (or analogous term), except where Service Provider determines the purposes and means of processing, in which case it may be deemed a controller in its own right for such processing.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.**  
Service Provider shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from the Company, as set forth in this Agreement or otherwise provided in writing by the Company, unless required to do so by Applicable Law, in which case Service Provider shall inform the Company of that legal requirement before processing, unless prohibited by law.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
Service Provider shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, taking into account the state of the art, costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as well as the risks to data subjects.

11.4 **Subprocessors.**  
Service Provider may engage subprocessors to process Personal Data on its behalf, provided that: (a) Service Provider enters into a written agreement with each subprocessor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement; and (b) Service Provider remains fully liable to the Company for the performance of each subprocessor’s obligations. Upon reasonable written request, Service Provider shall provide the Company with a list of current subprocessors.

11.5 **Cross-Border Transfers.**  
To the extent Service Provider transfers Personal Data originating from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions with cross‑border transfer restrictions to a country that does not provide an adequate level of data protection as determined by the relevant authorities, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards, such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, UK International Data Transfer Addendum, or other valid transfer mechanisms, as may be required under Data Protection Laws.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.**  
Service Provider shall, to the extent reasonably practicable and as required by Data Protection Laws, assist the Company in responding to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights (e.g., access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, objection). If Service Provider receives a request directly from a data subject relating to Personal Data for which the Company is the controller, Service Provider shall promptly forward the request to the Company and shall not respond to the request except as instructed by the Company or required by law.

11.7 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed or reasonably suspected personal data breach (as defined under Data Protection Laws) affecting Personal Data processed under this Agreement, Service Provider shall: (a) notify the Company without undue delay and, where feasible, within seventy‑two (72) hours after becoming aware of the breach; (b) provide the Company with information reasonably requested and available to Service Provider to assist the Company in complying with its legal obligations, including notification to supervisory authorities and affected data subjects; and (c) take reasonable steps to investigate, mitigate, and remedy the breach.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Service Provider shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes of processing under this Agreement or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Service Provider shall, at the Company’s written request, delete or return all Personal Data in its possession or control, except to the extent retention is required by law or necessary for legitimate business purposes (e.g., legal defense, audit).

11.9 **Audits.**  
Upon the Company’s reasonable prior written notice, and no more than once per year (unless required by a supervisory authority or in the event of a material data breach), Service Provider shall allow the Company or its designated auditor to conduct an audit of Service Provider’s data protection and security controls relevant to the Services, either by way of reviewing third‑party certifications and audit reports (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001) or, if necessary, on‑site assessments, subject to reasonable confidentiality and security measures.

12.4 **Service Credits.**  
If Service Provider fails to meet the uptime commitment in **Section 12.1** or materially and repeatedly misses response or resolution targets under **Section 12.3**, the Company may be eligible for non‑cash service credits as follows:

  (a) For each full 0.5% increment by which the monthly uptime falls below 99.9% (but remains above 98.0%), the Company shall be entitled to a credit equal to 5% of the monthly service fees for the affected services, up to a maximum of 25% of such monthly fees.  
  (b) Service credits shall be the Company’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the Service Levels, except in the case of willful misconduct or gross negligence by Service Provider, in which case the Company may pursue any and all remedies under this Agreement and Applicable Law.

Service credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall not be refundable in cash.

12.5 **Exclusions.**  
Service Levels shall not apply, and service credits shall not be available, to the extent performance issues are caused by: (a) the Company’s systems, networks, or equipment; (b) misuse or unauthorized modifications by the Company; (c) third‑party services, software, or infrastructure not under Service Provider’s control; or (d) Force Majeure Events.

13.4 **Disputes Regarding Changes.**  
If the Parties cannot agree on a Change Order, the Services shall continue in accordance with the then‑current scope, and the dispute may be escalated in accordance with **Article XIV**.

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a **“Dispute”**), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through negotiation between the Parties’ respective project managers.

The mediation shall be commenced by one Party delivering a written request for mediation to the other Party.

14.3 **Arbitration.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved by mediation within sixty (60) days of the mediator’s appointment (or such longer period as the Parties may agree), the Dispute shall be finally resolved by **binding arbitration** administered by the **Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC)** in accordance with the SIAC Rules then in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The seat of arbitration shall be Singapore. The tribunal shall consist of **three (3) arbitrators**. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The arbitral award shall be final and binding on the Parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

14.4 **Interim Relief.**  
Nothing in this **Article XIV** shall prevent either Party from seeking interim or conservatory measures, including injunctive relief or specific performance, from any court of competent jurisdiction at any time, to protect its rights, including rights related to Confidential Information and Intellectual Property, as contemplated in **Articles V and VI**.
