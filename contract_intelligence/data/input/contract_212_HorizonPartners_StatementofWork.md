## ARTICLE VIII  
## INDEMNIFICATION

8.1 **Indemnification by the Company.**  

The Company’s indemnification obligations under **Section 8.1** of the Parent Agreement apply to this SOW. Without limitation, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Horizon and the Service Provider Indemnitees from Losses arising out of or relating to:

- The Company’s breach of this SOW or the Parent Agreement;  
- The Company’s use of the Services or Work Product, including business decisions or actions taken based on recommendations under this SOW;  
- Claims relating to Client Materials or the Company’s misuse of the Work Product.

8.2 **Indemnification by the Service Provider.**  

Horizon’s indemnification obligations under **Section 8.2** of the Parent Agreement apply to this SOW. Horizon shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company Indemnitees from Losses arising out of any Third‑Party claim that the Work Product, as delivered under this SOW and used in accordance herewith, directly infringes specified Intellectual Property Rights, subject to the exceptions in **Section 8.2(a)–(d)** of the Parent Agreement.

8.4 **Infringement Remedies.**

---

## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (SOW‑SPECIFIC)

9.1 **Modification of Parent Agreement Risk Allocation.**  

The Parties acknowledge that **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement provides for **no contractual monetary cap on liability and no exclusion of consequential or similar damages**, reflecting a high‑risk engagement. For this **low‑risk SOW**, and in reliance on the specific scope and duration of this Project, the Parties agree that, **for claims arising solely under or in connection with this SOW**, the following provisions shall **prevail over Article IX of the Parent Agreement** to the extent of any direct conflict, as permitted by **Section 2.2(b)** of the Parent Agreement.

9.2 **Liability Cap for SOW.**  

9.2.1 **Aggregate Cap.** To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, the **total aggregate liability** of each Party to the other arising out of or relating to this SOW, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall not exceed **five (5) times the Fees paid and payable by the Company to Horizon under this SOW during the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.

9.2.2 For clarity, this cap applies **only** to claims whose primary basis is this SOW. If a claim arises under both the Parent Agreement and this SOW, the Parties will allocate the claim to the SOW‑specific cap to the extent attributable to SOW‑specific obligations and to the Parent Agreement framework otherwise.

9.3 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  

Except for the carve‑outs in Section 9.4, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any **indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages**, or for any loss of profits, revenue, business, or data, however caused and under any theory of liability, even if the Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This exclusion supersedes **Section 9.2** of the Parent Agreement for SOW‑related claims.

9.4 **Exceptions to Limitations.**  

The limitations in Sections 9.2 and 9.3 shall not apply to:

- A Party’s fraud or willful misconduct;  
- A Party’s obligations to pay Fees and reimbursable expenses due under this SOW;  
- The Company’s indemnification obligations under **Section 8.1** of the Parent Agreement (as applied to this SOW) for Third‑Party claims;  
- The Service Provider’s indemnification obligations under **Section 8.2** of the Parent Agreement (as applied to this SOW) for Third‑Party IP infringement claims;  
- A Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under **Article V** of the Parent Agreement (with respect to willful or intentional misuse).

9.5 **Applicability of Parent Agreement Limitations of Law.**  

Nothing in this SOW shall limit any liability to the extent such limitation is prohibited by Applicable Law, consistent with **Section 9.4** of the Parent Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE X  
## INSURANCE

10.1 **Insurance Coverage.**  

Horizon shall maintain the insurance coverages described in **Article X** of the Parent Agreement (Commercial General Liability, Professional Liability/Errors and Omissions, Cyber Liability, and Workers’ Compensation), with the minimum limits set forth therein, throughout the SOW Term and for one (1) year thereafter.

10.2 **Additional Insured.**  

To the extent commercially reasonable, the Company shall be named as an additional insured on Horizon’s Commercial General Liability policy for claims arising out of the Services under this SOW, consistent with **Section 10.2** of the Parent Agreement.

10.3 **Certificates of Insurance.**  

Upon Contoso’s written request, Horizon shall provide certificates of insurance evidencing the coverage required hereunder, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice of any cancellation or material reduction in coverage, as set forth in **Section 10.3** of the Parent Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  

Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with this SOW, as required by **Article XI** of the Parent Agreement. To the extent Horizon processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso in connection with this SOW, such processing shall be governed by the Parent Agreement and any applicable **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)** executed by the Parties pursuant to **Section 11.2** of the Parent Agreement.

12.2 **Availability.**  

For any hosted collaboration or project management tools provided by Horizon specifically for this Project, Horizon shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure such tools are available at least **99.9%** of the time during each calendar month, measured in accordance with the exclusions in **Section 12.5** of the Parent Agreement.

- Medium priority issues (moderate impact): **within 2 Business Days**;  
- Low priority issues (minor impact or inquiries): **within 3 Business Days**.

These SOW‑specific response times supplement the framework of **Section 12.3** of the Parent Agreement.

12.4 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.**  

If Horizon fails to meet the availability or response time commitments in this Article XII in a given calendar month, the Company shall be entitled, as its sole and exclusive remedy for such SLA breaches, to service credits not to exceed **five percent (5%) of the Fees invoiced for Services under this SOW in such month**, consistent with **Section 12.4** of the Parent Agreement. The Company must request such credits in writing within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the SLA breach occurred.
