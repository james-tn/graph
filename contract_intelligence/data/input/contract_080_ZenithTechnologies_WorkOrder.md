  (a) Alleging that the Client Materials infringe or misappropriate any intellectual property rights or violate any privacy or data protection rights of any third party;

The Party seeking indemnification (the **“Indemnified Party”**) shall:

  (a) Promptly notify the other Party (the **“Indemnifying Party”**) in writing of any Claim for which it seeks indemnification (provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent it is materially prejudiced thereby);  

  (b) Permit the Indemnifying Party to assume control of the defence and settlement of the Claim, provided that:

   - The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any admission of liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld); and  
   - The Indemnified Party may participate in the defence with its own counsel at its own expense;

  (c) Cooperate reasonably with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defence and settlement of the Claim.

In the event of any Claim covered under Section 8.1, Zenith may, at its option and expense:

  (a) Procure for Contoso the right to continue using the allegedly infringing Services or Work Product;  

  (b) Replace or modify the Services or Work Product so that they become non-infringing while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or  

  (c) If neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected Services or Work Product and refund to Contoso any prepaid Fees for the unused portion of the Term for such Services or Work Product.

The remedies in this Section 8.4 constitute Contoso’s exclusive remedy for any IP infringement Claim relating to the Services or Work Product, subject to Article IX regarding uncapped liability.
