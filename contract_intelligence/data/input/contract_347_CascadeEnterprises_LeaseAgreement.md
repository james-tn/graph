(a) **Base Rent Amount.** Contoso shall pay to Cascade a monthly Base Rent of **US$42.50 per rentable square foot per year** for 22,000 rentable square feet, which equals an annual Base Rent of **US$935,000** and a monthly Base Rent of **US$77,916.67**, payable as set forth in **Section 3.5 (Invoicing and Net 60 Payment Terms)**.  

(b) **Allocation.** The Contract Value includes Base Rent for the Term and estimated Operating Expenses, Taxes, and certain fees, but excludes: (i) after-hours HVAC; (ii) additional security requests; (iii) overtime or expedited tenant improvement services; and (iv) any other optional services requested by Contoso.

3.3 **Operating Expenses and Additional Rent.**  
(a) Contoso shall pay, as **Additional Rent**, its proportionate share of Operating Expenses and Taxes for the Building. Contoso’s proportionate share shall be calculated as the ratio of the rentable square footage of the Lease Premises to the total rentable square footage of the Building, all as reasonably determined by Cascade.  

(b) Cascade shall provide Contoso with an annual estimate of Operating Expenses, and Contoso shall pay its proportionate share in equal monthly installments in advance. Within 180 days after the end of each calendar year, Cascade shall provide an Operating Expense reconciliation, and any overpayment by Contoso shall be credited against future rent (or refunded if no future rent is due), while any underpayment shall be paid by Contoso within sixty (60) days after the reconciliation invoice date.  

(c) Operating Expenses shall specifically include, without limitation: property insurance premiums, maintenance and repair costs, janitorial, landscaping, common area utilities, security services, property management fees, and other common building expenses, but shall exclude costs expressly disallowed under Applicable Law for pass-through to tenants.

3.4 **Utilities.**  
(a) **Electricity and Gas.** Where separately metered or sub-metered, Contoso shall pay for electricity and gas consumption directly to the utility or as pass-through charges invoiced by Cascade.

The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any disputes; if unresolved within sixty (60) days, the dispute shall be escalated pursuant to **Article XIV (Dispute Resolution)**.

3.6 **Late Payments and Interest.**  
Any undisputed amount not paid when due shall accrue interest at a rate equal to the lesser of: (i) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month; or (ii) the maximum rate allowed by Applicable Law, calculated from the due date until the date of actual payment. Interest shall not waive Cascade’s right to treat such non-payment as an Event of Default under **Section 4.5(a)**.

3.7 **Security Deposit.**  
Cascade may require a security deposit in an amount equal to **two (2) months’ Base Rent**, to be held by Cascade as security for Contoso’s performance of its obligations. Cascade may, in its sole discretion, apply the security deposit to cure any Contoso default.

Contoso shall reimburse Cascade for any expenses incurred by Cascade on Contoso’s written request, including after-hours HVAC, additional security, or expedited maintenance, at Cascade’s then-current rates. Such reimbursable expenses shall be invoiced monthly and paid in accordance with the Net 60 terms.

3.9 **Taxes on Rent.**  
Contoso shall be responsible for any sales, use, occupancy, or similar taxes, duties, or charges (excluding Cascade’s income taxes) imposed by any governmental authority on the rent or other payments made under this Agreement.
