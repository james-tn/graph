## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Laws relating to data protection and privacy, including, where applicable, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA).

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  
To the extent Zenith processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso in connection with the Services, the Parties acknowledge that:

  (a) Contoso is the “data controller” (or equivalent term under Applicable Law); and

11.3 **Processing Instructions.**  
Zenith shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, as set forth in this Agreement, in any SOW, or as otherwise documented in writing.

11.4 **Security Measures.**  
Zenith shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage, having regard to the nature of the data and the risks involved. Such measures shall be no less stringent than those Zenith applies to its own similar data and shall at a minimum include encryption in transit, access controls, logging, and regular security assessments.

11.5 **Sub-Processors.**  
Zenith shall not engage any sub-processor to process Personal Data without Contoso’s prior written consent. Zenith shall ensure that any approved sub-processor is bound by written data protection obligations no less protective than those set out in this Article XI. Zenith shall remain fully liable for the acts and omissions of its sub-processors.

11.6 **International Transfers.**  
Zenith shall not transfer Personal Data outside of the country or region in which it was originally collected (e.g., outside the European Economic Area for GDPR-covered data) without Contoso’s prior written approval and without implementing appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses, in accordance with Applicable Law.

11.7 **Data Subject Rights.**  
Zenith shall assist Contoso, to the extent reasonably possible and at Contoso’s cost where permitted by law, in responding to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Applicable Law, such as the right of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection.

11.8 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of any actual or suspected Personal Data breach affecting Personal Data processed by Zenith under this Agreement, Zenith shall:

  (a) promptly, and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours, notify Contoso upon becoming aware of such breach;  
  (b) provide Contoso with timely information regarding the nature of the breach, affected data, likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to address the breach; and  
  (c) cooperate fully with Contoso and relevant authorities to investigate, mitigate, and remediate the breach, including providing reasonable assistance with any required notifications.

11.9 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Zenith shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Contoso’s written request, Zenith shall promptly delete or return all Personal Data (and any copies thereof) in its possession or control, except where retention is required by law. Any retained Personal Data shall remain subject to the obligations of this Article XI.

11.10 **Audit Rights.**  
Contoso may, at its own expense and upon reasonable written notice, audit Zenith’s compliance with this Article XI once per year, or more frequently in the event of a data breach, either directly or through an independent third-party auditor subject to confidentiality. Zenith shall cooperate in good faith and provide relevant documentation, certifications, and access to relevant personnel as reasonably necessary.

  - **Priority 1 (Critical):** Complete loss of service or critical business impact.  
    - Response time: within 1 hour  
    - Work to resolve: 24x7 until resolved or workaround in place  

  - **Priority 2 (High):** Significant degradation of service with limited workaround.

    - Work to resolve: Business hours with extended coverage as needed  

  - **Priority 3 (Medium):** Non-critical issue with limited business impact.  
    - Response time: within 1 Business Day  

  - **Priority 4 (Low):** Minor issue, cosmetic defect, or general inquiry.  
    - Response time: within 3 Business Days  

12.4 **SLA Credits.**  
If Zenith fails to meet the uptime commitment or response time SLAs in a given calendar month, Contoso shall be entitled to service credits as follows:

  - Uptime between 99.0% and 99.9%: 5% of the monthly service Fees for the affected system;  
  - Uptime between 98.0% and 98.99%: 10% of the monthly service Fees;  
  - Uptime below 98.0%: 15% of the monthly service Fees; and  
  - Systemic failure to meet Priority 1 response times more than three (3) times in a month: additional 5% credit.

Service credits shall be applied against subsequent invoices. Service credits are Contoso’s exclusive monetary remedy for SLA failures, without prejudice to Contoso’s termination rights under Article IV.

12.5 **Exclusions.**  
SLA calculations shall exclude downtime or delays caused by: (a) Contoso’s systems or networks; (b) force majeure events under Article XV; (c) Contoso’s misuse or unauthorized modifications; or (d) scheduled maintenance notified in accordance with Section 12.2.

Either Party may request changes to the scope, Deliverables, timeline, or Fees through a written change request (a **“Change Request”**). The Change Request shall describe the proposed change, rationale, and any required timeline adjustments.

13.2 **Impact Assessment.**  
Upon receipt of a Change Request, Zenith shall within a reasonable timeframe (typically five (5) to ten (10) Business Days) assess the impact of the proposed change on scope, timeline, resources, and Fees, and shall provide Contoso with a written impact assessment.

Zenith shall not implement any material changes to the Services or Deliverables prior to receiving written approval of the Change Request from Contoso.

13.5 **Minor Changes.**  
The Parties may agree to a streamlined process for minor changes that do not materially affect Fees, timelines, or Deliverables, such as small configuration tweaks or documentation updates. Such minor changes may be documented via email or ticketing systems agreed by the Parties.

If the dispute is not resolved by mediation within sixty (60) days of the appointment of the mediator, the dispute shall be finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in accordance with the SIAC Rules for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The seat of arbitration shall be Singapore, the tribunal shall consist of one (1) arbitrator, and the language of arbitration shall be English.
