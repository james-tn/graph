Vendor’s obligations to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Client under **Section 8.1 (Vendor Indemnification)** of the Parent Agreement apply fully to the Amended Services and any Claims alleging that the Software, as configured and provided under this Amendment, infringes any United States patent, copyright, or trade secret.

9.1 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  

The limitation of certain types of damages set forth in **Section 9.1 (Exclusion of Certain Damages)** of the Parent Agreement (excluding indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, and loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunity) applies equally to Claims arising out of or relating to this Amendment.

9.2.2 For purposes of calculating the liability cap with respect to this Amendment, “Fees paid or payable under this Agreement” shall include Fees paid or payable under both the Parent Agreement and this Amendment during the relevant twelve (12) month period, to reflect the integrated nature of the relationship.

9.3 **Allocation of Risk.**  

The Parties reaffirm the allocation of risk described in **Section 9.3** of the Parent Agreement.

12.2 **Support Response Times.**
