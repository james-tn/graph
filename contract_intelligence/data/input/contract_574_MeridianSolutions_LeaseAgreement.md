Client shall keep the Leased Property free and clear of all liens, claims, and encumbrances, other than those arising from Vendor.

2.8 **Acceptance.**  
Where applicable, each Order Document may specify acceptance criteria and testing procedures for newly deployed Leased Property or Deliverables. If Client does not reject the relevant Deliverables or Leased Property by providing a written notice of material non-conformance within the specified acceptance period (or, if none is specified, within thirty (30) days following delivery), such Deliverables and Leased Property shall be deemed accepted. Client’s use of the Leased Property in production or live operations shall constitute acceptance, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

Because the Risk Level is identified as “Low,” Client shall have the right to terminate this Agreement or any Order Document, in whole or in part, for convenience without cause by providing Vendor with at least **thirty (30) days’ prior written notice**. Vendor shall also have a corresponding right to terminate for convenience with at least **sixty (60) days’ prior written notice** to Client, provided that Vendor shall complete all Services and maintain all Leased Property in accordance with this Agreement during such notice period and reasonably cooperate with Client’s transition efforts.

Leased Property shall be returned in substantially the same condition as when delivered, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

  4.4.3 **Accrued Rights and Payment.** Termination or expiration shall not relieve either Party of any obligation accrued prior to the effective date of termination, including Client’s obligation to pay all fees for Services rendered and Leased Property provided up to such effective date.

4.5 **Transition Assistance.**  
Upon Client’s request in connection with a termination or expiration (other than termination by Vendor for Client’s uncured material breach), Vendor shall provide reasonable transition assistance for up to sixty (60) days to enable Client to migrate to an alternative service provider or bring the services in-house.

## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

Each Party shall comply with all applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, including, as applicable, the **EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, the **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**, and other applicable national and state privacy laws.

11.2 **Role of the Parties.**  
The Parties acknowledge that, with respect to Personal Data contained in Client Data, Client is the “controller” (or equivalent term under applicable law) and Vendor acts as a “processor” (or equivalent term). Vendor shall process such Personal Data only on documented instructions from Client, as set forth in this Agreement and any applicable data processing addendum or Order Document.

11.3 **Data Security.**  
Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Client Data, including Personal Data, against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, taking into account the nature of the data and the risks inherent in processing.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Client Data (a “Data Breach”), Vendor shall: (a) notify Client without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach; (b) provide reasonably available information regarding the nature of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records concerned, likely consequences, and any measures taken or proposed to address the Data Breach; and (c) cooperate with Client’s reasonable requests in relation to any required notifications to data subjects or regulators.

11.5 **Subprocessors.**  
Vendor may engage subprocessors to process Personal Data on its behalf, provided Vendor ensures that such subprocessors are bound by written agreements requiring substantially similar data protection and security obligations as those imposed on Vendor under this Agreement. Vendor shall remain fully responsible for the acts and omissions of subprocessors.

11.6 **International Transfers.**  
To the extent Vendor processes Personal Data that is subject to GDPR outside the European Economic Area, Vendor shall ensure that appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or another lawful transfer mechanism) are in place. Details of such safeguards may be set out in a separate data processing addendum.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Vendor shall retain Client Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by applicable law.

## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Service Availability.**  
Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide an overall monthly service availability of at least **99.9%** for critical hosted or managed components of the Leased Property, excluding scheduled maintenance windows and emergency maintenance. Availability shall be measured at the network and system level as agreed in the applicable Order Document.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  
Vendor may perform scheduled maintenance that may affect service availability, provided Vendor gives Client at least five (5) Business Days’ prior notice and schedules such maintenance during off-peak hours where reasonably possible. Scheduled maintenance windows shall not count as downtime for purposes of calculating availability.

12.3 **Incident Response and Resolution.**  
Vendor shall respond to and use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve incidents in accordance with the following targets (which may be refined in an Order Document):

  - **Priority 1 (Critical)**: Service outage or severe degradation affecting core business operations.  
    - Initial Response: within 1 hour

  - **Priority 2 (High)**: Significant functionality impact with workaround available.  
    - Initial Response: within 4 hours  
    - Target Resolution: within 1 Business Day

    - Initial Response: within 1 Business Day  
    - Target Resolution: within 5 Business Days  

  - **Priority 4 (Low)**: Informational requests or cosmetic issues.  
    - Initial Response: within 2 Business Days  
    - Target Resolution: as planned in regular release cycles.

12.4 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.**  
If Vendor fails to meet the availability or response time Service Levels for a given calendar month, Client may be eligible for service credits calculated as a percentage of the monthly fees for the affected Services, as specified in the applicable Order Document. Service credits shall be Client’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for failure to meet the Service Levels, without prejudice to Client’s other contractual rights (including termination rights for repeated or material failures under **Article IV**).

12.5 **Exclusions.**  
Service Levels shall not apply to, and Vendor shall have no liability for, any failure or delay caused by: (a) Client’s misuse or unauthorized modification of the Leased Property or Services; (b) failures of Client’s networks, systems, or third-party services under Client’s control; (c) Force Majeure Events; or (d) scheduled maintenance conducted in accordance with **Section 12.2**.

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT

Either Party may request changes to the scope, specifications, timelines, or other aspects of the Services or Leased Property (each, a “Change Request”). Change Requests shall be in writing and shall describe the requested change, the rationale, and any scheduling or cost implications.

13.2 **Evaluation and Impact Assessment.**  
Upon receipt of a Change Request, the receiving Party shall promptly review it and, where Vendor is the receiving Party, Vendor shall prepare an impact assessment describing the anticipated effects on scope, fees, timelines, resources, and any other relevant factors.

13.3 **Change Order Approval.**  
No Change Request shall be effective unless and until the Parties have executed a written **Change Order** that references this Agreement and sets forth the agreed changes and any associated adjustments to Fees, milestones, or terms. Change Orders shall be deemed incorporated into the applicable Order Document.

13.4 **Continuation of Work.**  
Unless otherwise agreed, Vendor shall continue to perform the Services in accordance with the existing scope and schedule pending the Parties’ agreement on a Change Order. Vendor shall not be obligated to implement any change that materially increases its obligations or costs without a mutually executed Change Order.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a “Dispute”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal discussions between operational contacts.

14.2 **Escalation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved within fifteen (15) Business Days of initial notice, either Party may escalate the matter by providing written notice to the other Party. The Dispute shall then be referred to senior executives of each Party, who shall meet (in person or via teleconference) within ten (10) Business Days to attempt to resolve the Dispute in good faith.

14.3 **Mediation; Arbitration/Litigation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through escalation within thirty (30) days after escalation notice, the Parties may mutually agree to submit the Dispute to non-binding mediation before a mediator affiliated with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or similar body. If the Parties do not resolve the Dispute through mediation within sixty (60) days of appointment of a mediator, then, subject to **Section 14.4**, either Party may pursue any remedies available at law or in equity.

14.4 **Governing Law; Venue.**  
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **State of Delaware**, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Subject to the above escalation and mediation efforts, the Parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Delaware for the resolution of any Dispute. Each Party hereby waives any objection to venue in such courts.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek immediate injunctive, equitable, or other provisional relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information, intellectual property rights, or data security, without first engaging in escalation or mediation.

15.2 **Notification and Mitigation.**
