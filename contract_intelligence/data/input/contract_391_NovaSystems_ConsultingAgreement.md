## ARTICLE XI  
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.** The Parties acknowledge that, with respect to any Personal Data processed by Nova on behalf of Contoso in connection with the Services, Contoso acts as a “controller” (or equivalent term under Applicable Law) and Nova acts as a “processor” (or equivalent term).

11.2 **Processing Instructions.** Nova shall process Personal Data only on behalf of and in accordance with Contoso’s documented instructions and for the purposes of performing the Services, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, in which case Nova shall inform Contoso of such legal requirement before processing, unless prohibited by law.

11.4 **Sub‑Processors.** Nova may use subcontractors as sub‑processors provided that:  

  (a) such sub‑processors are bound by written data protection obligations no less protective than those in this Article XI; and  

  (b) Nova remains liable for the acts and omissions of its sub‑processors.

11.5 **Cross‑Border Transfers.** To the extent Nova transfers Personal Data outside the jurisdiction from which it was originally collected (e.g., from the EU/EEA to the United States), Nova shall ensure that such transfers comply with Data Protection Laws, including by implementing appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses or other approved transfer mechanisms.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.** Nova shall assist Contoso, to the extent reasonably possible and taking into account the nature of the processing, in responding to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of access, rectification, erasure, or data portability), provided that Contoso is responsible for responding to such requests.

11.7 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a confirmed Personal Data breach affecting Personal Data processed by Nova on behalf of Contoso, Nova shall:

  (a) notify Contoso without undue delay (and in any event within seventy‑two (72) hours) after becoming aware of the breach;

11.9 **CCPA.** To the extent the CCPA applies, Nova shall:  

  (a) not “sell” Personal Data (as such term is defined in the CCPA);  

  (b) not retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any purpose other than providing the Services or as otherwise authorized in writing by Contoso; and

Service credits shall be Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for Service Level failures, without prejudice to Contoso’s right to terminate for persistent or material failures in accordance with Article IV.

12.6 **Exclusions.** Service Levels shall not apply to performance issues caused by:  

  (a) Contoso’s misuse or unauthorized use of the Services;  

  (b) failures of Contoso’s networks, systems, or third‑party infrastructure not under Nova’s control;
