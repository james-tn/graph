3.1 **Base Rent.** Tenant shall pay to Landlord, without setoff or deduction except as expressly permitted herein, fixed monthly Base Rent for the Premises in the aggregate amount that, when combined with reasonably estimated Additional Rent, corresponds to the agreed **Contract Value of US $427,025** over the Term. The Parties acknowledge that the actual total amounts may vary based on final Operating Expenses, Taxes, and adjustments permitted under this Agreement.

By way of example and for clarity, the Parties agree that Base Rent shall be as follows (subject to allocation between Base Rent and Additional Rent as mutually agreed and documented in an attached Rent Schedule, if any):

- From December 1, 2025 through November 30, 2026: **US $13,500 per month**;  
- From December 1, 2026 through November 30, 2027: **US $14,200 per month**;  
- From December 1, 2027 through January 6, 2028 (pro-rated): **US $14,200 per month**, prorated on a per diem basis.

If a more detailed Rent Schedule is executed by the Parties, such schedule shall control, provided it is consistent with the total Contract Value and the Term set forth herein.

3.2 **Additional Rent.** In addition to Base Rent, Tenant shall pay Additional Rent, including Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Operating Expenses and Taxes, any service charges, separately metered utilities, late fees, interest, and all other amounts payable by Tenant under this Agreement. All Additional Rent shall be due and payable in the same manner as Base Rent unless otherwise provided herein.

3.3 **Operating Expenses and Taxes.** Landlord shall have the right to allocate to Tenant, as Additional Rent, Tenant’s **Proportionate Share** of Operating Expenses and Taxes for each calendar year (or partial year) during the Term.

3.3.1 Landlord may estimate Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Operating Expenses and Taxes on an annual basis and bill Tenant in equal monthly installments in advance, subject to an annual reconciliation once actual Operating Expenses and Taxes are determined.

3.3.2 Within a reasonable time after the end of each calendar year, Landlord shall furnish Tenant with a statement (“**Expense Statement**”) setting forth the actual Operating Expenses and Taxes for such year, Tenant’s Proportionate Share thereof, and the amount of estimated payments previously made by Tenant.

3.3.3 If Tenant’s estimated payments exceed Tenant’s actual Proportionate Share, Landlord shall credit the excess against Tenant’s next due Rent or, if the Term has expired and no further Rent is due, refund such excess. If Tenant’s estimated payments are less than Tenant’s actual Proportionate Share, Tenant shall pay the deficiency within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Expense Statement.

3.4 **Payment Terms; Method of Payment.** All Rent and other sums payable by Tenant shall be paid in lawful money of the United States, in advance on or before the first (1st) day of each calendar month during the Term (except as otherwise indicated), and in any event no later than **Net 30** days from the date of Landlord’s invoice for Additional Rent or other non-recurring charges. Payments shall be made by wire transfer, ACH, or check to the address or account designated by Landlord in writing.

3.5 **Late Payments; Interest.** Any amount due hereunder that is not paid within **ten (10) days** after the due date shall accrue interest at the lesser of (a) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or (b) the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law, from the due date until paid. In addition, Landlord may assess a late payment fee equal to five percent (5%) of the overdue amount to cover Landlord’s administrative costs.

3.6 **Security Deposit.** If required by Landlord, Tenant shall deposit with Landlord a security deposit (“**Security Deposit**”) in an amount equal to at least one (1) month’s Base Rent (or such other amount as mutually agreed). The Security Deposit shall secure Tenant’s performance of its obligations under this Lease, may be commingled with Landlord’s general funds, and shall not bear interest unless required by law. Landlord may apply all or any portion of the Security Deposit to cure any default by Tenant, and Tenant shall promptly restore the Security Deposit to its original amount upon demand. Any unapplied Security Deposit shall be returned to Tenant within sixty (60) days following the Expiration Date or earlier termination of this Lease, subject to Tenant’s full performance of its obligations.

3.7 **Expenses and Reimbursements.** To the extent Tenant requests any services or utilities beyond those generally provided to tenants (e.g., after-hours HVAC, supplemental cooling, additional janitorial services, special security, or construction-related services), Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all reasonable, documented costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in providing such services, plus a reasonable administrative fee not to exceed fifteen percent (15%), as Additional Rent.

3.8 **Taxes on Rent; Withholding.** Tenant shall be responsible for all sales, use, rental, occupancy, and similar taxes, if any, imposed on the Rent or other charges payable hereunder by a governmental authority, excluding Landlord’s income, franchise, or net profit taxes. If Applicable Law requires Tenant to withhold taxes from payments to Landlord, Tenant shall (a) pay the required amount to the proper tax authority, (b) furnish Landlord with official receipts or other appropriate evidence of such payment, and (c) ensure that the net amount actually received by Landlord after withholding is no less than the amount that Landlord would have received absent such withholding.
