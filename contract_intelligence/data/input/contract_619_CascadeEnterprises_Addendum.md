9.2 **Aggregate Liability Cap for Addendum.** Notwithstanding **Section 9.2 (Aggregate Liability Cap)** of the Parent DPA (2x Fees), and taking into account the medium risk level and increased contract value, the Parties agree that:

  (a) For claims arising solely under or in connection with this Addendum and the Additional Processing Activities, each Party’s total aggregate liability to the other, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed **one times (1x)** the total Addendum Fees **actually paid** by Contoso to Cascade under this Addendum during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.** The Parties acknowledge that this limitation of liability reflects a fair allocation of risk in light of the medium risk profile, the Addendum Fees, and the nature of the Additional Processing Activities, and is consistent with **Section 9.4 (Allocation of Risk)** of the Parent DPA.
