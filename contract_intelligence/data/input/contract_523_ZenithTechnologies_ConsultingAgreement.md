## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Data Protection Laws, including without limitation the UK GDPR and, to the extent applicable, the EU GDPR and any analogous privacy laws.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  
To the extent the Vendor Processes Client Personal Data on behalf of the Client in the course of providing the Services, the Parties acknowledge that:

  a. the Client is the “controller” and the Vendor is the “processor” (as those terms are defined under Applicable Data Protection Laws); and  
  b. the Vendor shall Process Client Personal Data only on documented instructions from the Client, unless required by Applicable Law, in which case the Vendor shall inform the Client of that legal requirement before Processing, unless such law prohibits such information.

11.3 **Data Processing Addendum.**  
To the extent required by Applicable Data Protection Laws, the Parties shall enter into a separate data processing addendum (“**DPA**”) which shall form part of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the DPA regarding the Processing of Client Personal Data, the DPA shall prevail.

11.4 **Security Measures.**  
The Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Client Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, including, as appropriate:

  a. pseudonymization and encryption of Client Personal Data;  
  b. measures to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems;  
  c. measures to restore the availability and access to Client Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of an incident; and  
  d. regular testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of security measures.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a personal data breach (as defined under Applicable Data Protection Laws) affecting Client Personal Data, the Vendor shall:

  b. provide the Client with reasonable information about the nature of the breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records concerned, the likely consequences, and the measures taken or proposed to mitigate its adverse effects; and  
  c. cooperate with the Client to enable the Client to meet its obligations (including notification to supervisory authorities and data subjects, if required).

11.6 **Sub-Processors.**  
The Vendor shall not appoint any sub-processor to Process Client Personal Data without the Client’s prior written consent (which may be general consent for a list of sub-processors). The Vendor shall impose on any sub-processor data protection obligations no less protective than those set out in this Agreement and the DPA. The Vendor shall remain liable for the acts and omissions of its sub-processors.

11.7 **Data Transfers.**  
If the Vendor transfers Client Personal Data outside the UK or the European Economic Area (EEA), it shall ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with Applicable Data Protection Laws, including by implementing appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses or adequacy decisions.

The Vendor shall retain Client Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement or upon the Client’s written request, the Vendor shall, at the Client’s choice, delete or return all Client Personal Data and delete any existing copies, unless retention is required by Applicable Law. Evidence of deletion shall be made available to the Client upon request.
