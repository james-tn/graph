DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in relation to any Personal Data processed in connection with this Agreement.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.** The Parties acknowledge that:  

  (a) Each Party acts as an independent controller in relation to Personal Data that it processes for its own purposes (e.g., HR data of its employees, CCTV footage where under its control).  

  (b) To the extent Phoenix processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso (for example, access control data for Contoso’s personnel), Phoenix shall act as a processor and Contoso shall be the controller.

In the event of any inconsistency between the DPA and this Agreement regarding data processing, the DPA shall prevail.

11.4 **Security Measures.** Each Party shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, having regard to the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing.

  (a) In the event of a personal data breach (as defined under Data Protection Laws) involving Personal Data processed in connection with this Agreement, the affected Party shall notify the other Party without undue delay and, where feasible, within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the breach.  

  (b) Such notification shall include, to the extent known, the nature of the breach, categories and approximate number of data subjects, categories and approximate number of Personal Data records concerned, and the likely consequences and measures taken to address the breach.

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Each Party shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, each Party shall delete or anonymise Personal Data related to the other Party, except to the extent retention is required by law or for legitimate business purposes (e.g., compliance, litigation). Any retained Personal Data shall remain subject to the obligations herein.

12.3 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.**  

  (a) If Phoenix fails to meet the uptime guarantee or response/resolution targets in two (2) consecutive quarters, Phoenix shall meet with Contoso to formulate a corrective action plan.  

  (b) If Phoenix fails to implement the corrective action plan within a reasonable time, Contoso shall be entitled to a service credit not exceeding **5% of the monthly service charge** for the affected quarter.  

  (c) Service credits shall be Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for SLA failures, without prejudice to its right to terminate for repeated material breaches under Section 4.4 and seek damages under Article IX.
