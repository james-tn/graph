2.3 **Milestones and Timelines.**  

2.3.1 The Parties agree that the implementation phase shall commence on the Amendment Effective Date or as otherwise specified in an SOW and shall continue until the earlier of (a) Client’s written acceptance of the production-ready environment in accordance with **Section 2.7**, or (b) such other date as may be mutually agreed.  

2.3.2 Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the target dates and milestones set out in any SOW. The Parties acknowledge that timelines are estimates and may be adjusted to reflect changes in scope, dependencies on Client resources, or other factors beyond Vendor’s reasonable control in accordance with **Article XIII** (Change Management).

2.3.3 If Client fails to perform its obligations under **Section 2.5** in a timely manner, all associated milestones and deadlines shall be automatically extended by a period equal to the duration of such delay plus a reasonable remobilisation period, and Vendor shall not be liable for any consequences of such delay.

2.4.2 Vendor does not warrant that the Services or Deliverables will be error-free or uninterrupted, but Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimise service disruptions and to remedy known defects in accordance with the Service Levels.

2.5 **Client Responsibilities.**  

Client acknowledges that Vendor’s performance is dependent upon Client’s timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of information provided by Client. Accordingly, Client shall:

2.5.1 Provide Vendor with access to Client’s systems, networks, facilities, data, and personnel as reasonably required for Vendor to perform the Services;

2.5.5 Comply with all reasonable Vendor policies and security procedures that are communicated to Client and necessary for the provision of the Services.

Any failure by Client to fulfil its obligations under this **Section 2.5** shall constitute a Client-caused delay and may entitle Vendor to additional Fees, extensions of time, or other relief, as may be determined under **Article XIII**.

2.6 **Subcontractors.**  

Vendor may engage Subcontractors to perform all or any part of the Services or to provide any Deliverables, provided that Vendor shall remain responsible for the acts and omissions of such Subcontractors as if they were the acts and omissions of Vendor.

2.7.3 If Client provides a timely notice of rejection identifying material non-conformities, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct such non-conformities and re-deliver the Deliverable for re-testing. This process shall repeat until acceptance, provided that if Vendor reasonably determines that the non-conformity is not due to Vendor’s failure to meet the agreed specifications, Vendor may charge additional Fees for remediation.

2.8 **Changes to Scope.**  

Any changes to the scope of Services or Deliverables shall be managed in accordance with **Article XIII** (Change Management) and shall not be binding unless agreed in writing by both Parties.
