## ARTICLE II  
SCOPE OF SERVICES / WORK UNDER AMENDMENT

2.1 **Relationship to Parent Agreement Scope.** The Parties acknowledge that **Article II (Scope of Leased Premises and Services)** of the Parent Agreement sets forth the baseline framework for (i) the lease of the Premises under **Section 2.1**, (ii) the permitted use of the Premises under **Section 2.2**, and (iii) the Services to be provided by Titan under **Section 2.3**, including building structure and systems, common area maintenance, utilities, security and access control, janitorial services for common areas, and maintenance management and reporting, as well as Contoso’s responsibilities under **Section 2.4** and the rules for Improvements under **Section 2.5**.  

This Amendment is intended to **supplement, clarify, and extend** such scope for the Amended Term, and to specify certain Enhanced Services and Supplemental Deliverables associated with the Extended Term and the Amendment Contract Value.

2.2 **Continuation of Lease of Premises.**  

(a) Titan shall continue to lease to Contoso, and Contoso shall continue to lease from Titan, the **Premises** as defined in **Section 1.1(m)** of the Parent Agreement, without change to the rentable square footage or general description of the leased area, for the duration of the Amended Term (including the Extended Term).  

(b) Except as expressly modified by this Amendment, all rights of use and access to the common areas, parking, loading docks, driveways, and other appurtenant facilities under **Section 2.1** of the Parent Agreement shall remain in full force and effect during the Amended Term.

2.3 **Extended Term Operations and Use.**  

(a) The Parties confirm that Contoso shall continue to use the Premises solely for the purposes stated in **Section 2.2(a)** of the Parent Agreement—namely, “the operation of a corporate operations, light industrial, warehousing, logistics, and associated administrative office facility”—and for no other purpose without Titan’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).  

(b) Titan reaffirms its obligation under **Section 2.2(b)** of the Parent Agreement to ensure that its operations and those of other tenants do not unreasonably interfere with Contoso’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises, and acknowledges that maintaining such quiet enjoyment throughout the Extended Term is a material incentive for Contoso to enter into this Amendment.

2.4 **Enhanced Services and Supplemental Deliverables.** During the Amended Term (including the Extended Term), Titan shall provide the following Enhanced Services, in addition to the Services described in **Section 2.3** of the Parent Agreement:

(a) **Preventive Maintenance Enhancements.** Titan shall implement a more robust preventive maintenance program for base building mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection, and HVAC systems serving the Premises, including:  

  (i) Scheduled quarterly inspections and filter replacements for HVAC systems dedicated to or materially serving the Premises, beyond any baseline obligations set forth in **Section 2.3(a)(ii)** of the Parent Agreement;  

  (ii) Semi‑annual infrared scanning of main electrical panels serving the Premises to detect and mitigate potential failures; and  

  (iii) Annual load testing (or equivalent reliability testing) of backup systems affecting the Premises, if and to the extent such systems are installed and within Titan’s control.

(b) **Security and Access Reporting.** In addition to maintaining base building security systems as required under **Section 2.3(d)** of the Parent Agreement, Titan shall:  

  (i) Provide Contoso with **monthly access control reports** detailing card access events for the Premises and relevant common access points, subject to data protection and privacy requirements in **Article XI** of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment;  

  (ii) Provide, upon request up to four (4) times per calendar year, **CCTV incident review summaries** related to documented security incidents impacting the Premises, with timestamps and incident narrative where reasonably available; and  

  (iii) Maintain a centralized incident log and make incident entries related to the Premises available to Contoso within ten (10) Business Days of a written request, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and subject to confidentiality obligations under **Article V** of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment.

(c) **Utilities Optimization and Reporting.** In addition to providing utilities as described in **Section 2.3(c)** of the Parent Agreement, Titan shall:  

  (i) Use commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate with utility providers to implement or maintain sub‑metering or equivalent allocation mechanisms where feasible, in order to provide more accurate utility consumption data for the Premises;  

  (ii) Provide **quarterly utility consumption summaries** for the Premises, including at least kWh usage (for electricity) and any other metered utilities, and reasonable comparative analysis versus prior quarters; and  

  (iii) Collaborate with Contoso, at Contoso’s written request, not more than twice per lease year, on **energy efficiency reviews**, subject to any mutually agreed cost recovery for third‑party consultants.

(d) **Maintenance Management and SLA Reporting.** Building on **Section 2.3(f)** of the Parent Agreement, Titan shall:  

  (i) Maintain its maintenance ticketing or helpdesk system and grant Contoso continued access thereto for the Amended Term;  

  (ii) Provide **monthly SLA performance reports** summarizing the number and type of maintenance requests submitted by Contoso, response times, resolution times, and compliance with the Service Levels under **Article XII** of the Parent Agreement and **Article XII** of this Amendment; and  

  (iii) Participate, upon Contoso’s request not more than quarterly, in **operational review meetings** (virtual or in person) of up to one (1) hour, to review maintenance, SLA performance, and any systemic issues.

(e) **Improvements and Alterations During Extended Term.** The Parties reaffirm **Section 2.5 (Improvements and Alterations)** of the Parent Agreement. During the Extended Term:  

  (i) Titan shall consider in good faith any Contoso requests for non‑structural Improvements that are intended to enhance operational efficiency or safety, subject to Contoso bearing the incremental cost of such Improvements unless otherwise agreed in writing;  

  (ii) Any required restoration at the end of the Amended Term shall follow **Section 2.5(c)** of the Parent Agreement, provided that Titan shall notify Contoso in writing of any required removals no later than thirty (30) days prior to the new Expiration Date of **April 20, 2027**; and  

  (iii) To the extent Titan undertakes building‑wide capital improvements during the Extended Term that materially affect the Premises, Titan shall coordinate scheduling with Contoso to minimize disruption.

2.5 **Performance Standards.** The performance standards set forth in **Section 2.6** of the Parent Agreement shall continue to apply during the Amended Term. In addition, Titan acknowledges that, given the Low Risk Profile associated with this Amendment, Titan shall:

(a) Use commercially reasonable efforts to proactively identify and address conditions that may jeopardize compliance with the Service Levels;  

(b) Ensure that any third‑party contractors engaged to perform portions of the Enhanced Services are bound by contractual obligations consistent with the performance standards in **Section 2.6** of the Parent Agreement; and  

(c) Cooperate in good faith with Contoso to implement reasonable remedial measures if recurring service deficiencies are identified through SLA reports or operational review meetings.

2.6 **No Reduction of Services.** Titan shall not reduce the quality or scope of the Services provided under **Article II** of the Parent Agreement as of the Amendment Effective Date, except with Contoso’s prior written consent or as required by Applicable Law. Any such reduction approved by Contoso shall be documented via a written change order pursuant to **Article XIII (Change Management)** of this Amendment.

FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Reference to Parent Economic Terms.** The Parties acknowledge that **Article III (Fees and Payment Terms)** of the Parent Agreement sets forth the original Contract Value of **US$3,039,526** (Section 3.1), the Base Rent structure and illustrative schedule (Section 3.2), the Additional Rent framework and Operating Expenses (Section 3.3), the **Net 30** payment terms for non‑rent charges (Section 3.4), and late payment, taxes, reimbursement, and Security Deposit provisions (Sections 3.5–3.8).

3.2 **Amendment Contract Value.**  

(a) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that this Amendment establishes an additional and/or adjusted **Contract Value** attributable to the Amended Term, including the Extended Term, in the amount of **US$2,289,193** (the “Amendment Contract Value”).  

(b) The Amendment Contract Value:  

  (i) Includes Base Rent applicable during the Extended Term;  

  (ii) Reflects the Parties’ good faith estimate of Additional Rent, Operating Expenses, and fees associated with the Enhanced Services; and  

  (iii) Shall be read in conjunction with, and as an addition to, the Contract Value stated in **Section 3.1** of the Parent Agreement for the period from the Commencement Date through July 31, 2026.

3.3 **Extension Rent Schedule.**  

(a) The Parties acknowledge the **Reference Rent Schedule** set forth in **Section 3.2(a)** of the Parent Agreement, which provides, on an illustrative basis, monthly Base Rent for Lease Year 1 (US$90,000), Lease Year 2 (US$94,500), and pro‑rated Base Rent for the partial year through July 31, 2026.  

(b) For the Extended Term (August 1, 2026 through April 20, 2027), the Parties agree to the following Extension Rent Schedule, which supersedes any inconsistent sample schedules in the Parent Agreement solely for such period:

  (i) **August 1, 2026 – February 9, 2027**: Monthly Base Rent of **US$98,225** per month; and  

  (ii) **February 10, 2027 – April 20, 2027**: Pro‑rated Base Rent at a monthly rate of **US$98,225**, payable in advance in proportion to the number of days in the partial month.

(c) Base Rent under this Amendment shall continue to be **due and payable in advance on or before the first (1st) day of each calendar month** during the Extended Term, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, except as expressly permitted in the Parent Agreement or this Amendment.

3.4 **Additional Rent and Operating Expenses During Extended Term.**  

(a) During the Extended Term, Contoso shall continue to pay **Additional Rent** and its proportionate share of **Operating Expenses** and **Taxes**, as described in **Section 3.3** of the Parent Agreement, on the same allocation basis (e.g., rentable square foot) applied prior to the Extended Term, unless the Parties mutually agree in writing to a different allocation.  

(b) Titan shall provide updated annual estimates and year‑end reconciliations in accordance with **Section 3.3(b)** of the Parent Agreement. Any Additional Rent associated with Enhanced Services (e.g., incremental security reporting, additional preventive maintenance) will be included in such Operating Expenses unless otherwise separately itemized and agreed.

3.5 **Payment Terms – Net 30 Reaffirmed.**  

(a) The **Net 30** payment terms in **Section 3.4** of the Parent Agreement are hereby expressly reaffirmed and apply fully to all non‑Base Rent charges under this Amendment, including any separately invoiced Enhanced Services, reimbursable expenses, or other charges.  

(b) If Contoso disputes any portion of an invoice under this Amendment, the dispute resolution process in **Section 3.4(b)** of the Parent Agreement and the escalation procedures in **Article XIV (Dispute Resolution)** of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment shall apply.

3.6 **Late Payments and Interest.** Titan’s rights to charge interest on late payments and to suspend non‑essential Services in the event of non‑payment, as set forth in **Section 3.5** of the Parent Agreement, shall continue to apply during the Amended Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, given the Low Risk Profile, Titan agrees that:

(a) Titan shall provide an additional **five (5) Business Day courtesy notice** (beyond the notice provided under Section 3.5 of the Parent Agreement) before suspending any non‑essential Enhanced Services under this Amendment; and  

(b) Titan shall not suspend Services in a manner that materially compromises safety or compliance with Applicable Law.

3.7 **Taxes, Expenses, and Reimbursements.** The provisions of **Sections 3.6 (Taxes)** and **3.7 (Expenses and Reimbursement)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply mutatis mutandis to this Amendment. Any incremental costs incurred by Titan at Contoso’s specific written request in connection with the Enhanced Services (e.g., expanded CCTV retention, customized reporting) shall be reimbursed as Additional Rent in accordance with Section 3.7 of the Parent Agreement, provided such costs are pre‑approved in writing by Contoso where reasonably practicable.

3.8 **Security Deposit.** The Security Deposit provisions in **Section 3.8** of the Parent Agreement shall remain unchanged by this Amendment. Titan shall not require any increase to the Security Deposit solely as a result of the execution of this Amendment, absent a mutually agreed written adjustment based on a material change in Contoso’s creditworthiness.

---

## ARTICLE IV  
TERM AND TERMINATION

4.1 **Amended Term and Expiration Date.**  

(a) The Parties acknowledge that **Section 1.1(h)** of the Parent Agreement defines “Expiration Date” as July 31, 2026, and **Section 4.1** defines the “Term” as commencing on the Commencement Date and continuing until the Expiration Date, unless earlier terminated.  

(b) The Parties hereby **amend and replace** the definition of “Expiration Date” in **Section 1.1(h)** of the Parent Agreement solely with respect to the Term of the Lease, such that the Expiration Date shall be **April 20, 2027**, unless earlier terminated in accordance with Article IV of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment.  

(c) The Term under **Section 4.1** of the Parent Agreement shall be deemed automatically extended to include the Extended Term defined in **Section 1.2(e)** of this Amendment without any requirement that Contoso exercise a renewal option, and this Amendment shall serve as the Parties’ written evidence of such extension.

4.2 **Renewal Options; Clarification.**  

(a) **Section 4.2 (Renewal Options)** of the Parent Agreement grants Contoso one (1) option to renew for an additional period of three (3) years on mutually agreed terms, subject to written notice at least nine (9) months prior to the Expiration Date.  

(b) The Parties agree that, in light of the new Expiration Date of April 20, 2027, any future exercise of the renewal option shall be measured by reference to such new Expiration Date, such that Contoso’s notice deadline shall be **July 20, 2026**, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing.  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, this Amendment **does not** constitute the exercise of the renewal option described in Section 4.2 of the Parent Agreement; rather, it is an agreed extension of the original Term and modification of lease economics.

4.3 **Termination for Convenience.**  

(a) **Section 4.3(a)** of the Parent Agreement permits either Party to terminate the Lease for convenience with at least ninety (90) days’ prior written notice, effective no earlier than July 31, 2025, unless otherwise mutually agreed.  

(b) For the period from the Amendment Effective Date through the new Expiration Date, the Parties agree that Contoso shall have the right, as a client‑favorable Low‑risk adjustment, to terminate this Amendment and the Parent Agreement for convenience on **not less than sixty (60) days’ prior written notice** to Titan, provided that:  

  (i) The effective date of such termination shall not be earlier than **January 31, 2026**, unless otherwise mutually agreed;  

  (ii) Contoso shall remain liable for all amounts accrued and unpaid through the effective date of termination; and  

  (iii) Any early termination fee or unamortized landlord contributions described in any separate addendum to the Parent Agreement shall continue to apply, if and to the extent applicable.

(c) Titan’s right to terminate for convenience under **Section 4.3** of the Parent Agreement shall remain as originally drafted; provided, however, that Titan shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate any disruption to Contoso’s operations and to support potential relocation, consistent with the mitigation obligations referenced in Section 4.3(b) of the Parent Agreement.

4.4 **Termination for Cause.** The Parties reaffirm the termination for cause rights set forth in **Section 4.4** of the Parent Agreement. Any material breach of this Amendment shall be deemed a material breach of the Parent Agreement, and vice versa, and shall entitle the non‑breaching Party to the applicable cure and termination rights under Section 4.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

(a) For breaches related solely to the Enhanced Services or SLA Enhancements, Contoso agrees that Titan shall have a **minimum cure period of thirty (30) days** (or longer if explicitly provided herein) following notice, provided Titan has commenced cure and is diligently pursuing completion; and  

(b) Persistent or repeated Service Level failures as described in **Article XII** of this Amendment may constitute grounds for termination for cause by Contoso under **Section 4.4(b)(i)** of the Parent Agreement if such failures materially impair Contoso’s ability to conduct its business from the Premises.

4.5 **Effect of Parent Agreement Termination on this Amendment.**  

(a) This Amendment **amends and supplements** the Parent Agreement and does not create a standalone lease. Accordingly, any **Parent Agreement Termination** (including any termination for convenience or cause, or expiration of the Term without renewal) shall automatically and concurrently terminate this Amendment, without the need for separate notice.  

(b) Upon any such termination, the rights and obligations of the Parties shall be determined in accordance with **Section 4.5 (Effect of Termination or Expiration)** of the Parent Agreement, as supplemented by this Amendment.  

(c) Sections of this Amendment that by their nature should survive termination or expiration (including, without limitation, Articles III (to the extent of accrued obligations), V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII (as to accrued credits), XIV, XV, and XVI) shall so survive, to the same extent and under the same rationale as the surviving provisions listed in **Section 4.5(c)** and **Section 16.13** of the Parent Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE V  
CONFIDENTIALITY

5.1 **Incorporation of Parent Agreement Confidentiality Terms.** The Parties reaffirm and incorporate by reference the confidentiality obligations set forth in **Article V (Confidentiality)** of the Parent Agreement, including the definition of “Confidential Information” in **Section 5.1** and the obligations, permitted disclosures, return or destruction requirements, and survival provisions in **Sections 5.2–5.5**.

5.2 **Expanded Confidential Information.** For purposes of this Amendment, “Confidential Information” shall also include, without limitation:

(a) Any Supplemental Deliverables, including security incident reports, access control logs, CCTV summaries, SLA reports, and maintenance logs, to the extent they reveal non‑public information about the building, building systems, other tenants, or Contoso’s operations;  

(b) Any detailed financial data, rent schedules, or projections specific to the Amendment Contract Value and Extension Rent Schedule; and  

(c) Any operational review meeting notes or summaries that document sensitive business or operational strategies of either Party.

5.3 **Use and Protection Obligations.** The Receiving Party shall:  

(a) Use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information solely for purposes of performing or exercising rights under the Parent Agreement and this Amendment;  

(b) Restrict disclosure of such Confidential Information to those of its personnel and professional advisors who have a need to know and who are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective than those under the Parent Agreement; and  

(c) Implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards commensurate with the sensitivity of the Confidential Information, taking into account the Low Risk Profile but not reducing the minimum standard of “reasonable care” required under **Section 5.2** of the Parent Agreement.

5.4 **Exceptions and Required Disclosures.** The exceptions set forth in **Section 5.1** of the Parent Agreement (public domain, third‑party receipt, independent development, and approved release) shall apply to this Amendment. Required disclosures under Applicable Law or court order shall follow the procedure set forth in **Section 5.3** of the Parent Agreement.

5.5 **Survival.** The obligations under this Article V shall commence on the Amendment Effective Date and shall continue for a period of **five (5) years** following the termination or expiration of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment; provided, however, that trade secrets shall be maintained in confidence for so long as they constitute trade secrets under Applicable Law, consistent with **Section 5.5** of the Parent Agreement.

6.2 **Ownership of Supplemental Deliverables.**  

(a) To the extent Titan creates any Supplemental Deliverables specifically for Contoso under this Amendment that do not constitute building design, building systems, or other asset‑related IP, such Supplemental Deliverables shall be treated in the same manner as “Deliverables” under **Section 6.2** of the Parent Agreement.  

(b) Titan shall retain ownership of the underlying methodologies, templates, and tools used to generate such Supplemental Deliverables, and Contoso shall receive a non‑exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty‑free license to use, copy, and internally distribute such Supplemental Deliverables solely in connection with its business operations at or related to the Premises.

6.3 **Use of Building Systems; Enhanced Access.** The license granted under **Section 6.3 (License to Use Building Systems)** of the Parent Agreement is hereby confirmed for the duration of the Amended Term. In addition:

(b) Contoso shall not attempt to circumvent or interfere with any security controls or proprietary features embedded in such systems, except as expressly permitted by Applicable Law.

6.4 **No Additional Trademark Rights.** Nothing in this Amendment grants either Party any broader right to use the other Party’s trademarks or logos than those set forth in **Section 6.4** of the Parent Agreement. Titan may continue to list Contoso in tenant rosters and directories for the building, and Contoso may reference the Premises in its ordinary course business communications.

6.5 **Restrictions.** Contoso shall continue to comply with the restrictions set forth in **Section 6.5** of the Parent Agreement with respect to Titan’s IP and building systems. Similarly, Titan shall not use Contoso’s trademarks in marketing materials without Contoso’s prior written consent, except as permitted under Section 6.4 of the Parent Agreement.

8.1 **Incorporation of Parent Indemnification Obligations.** The indemnification obligations set forth in **Article VIII (Indemnification)** of the Parent Agreement, including **Section 8.1 (Indemnification by Titan)** and **Section 8.2 (Indemnification by Contoso)**, are hereby incorporated by reference and shall apply fully to this Amendment, the Enhanced Services, and the Extended Term.

8.2 **Scope of Indemnification.** For clarity:

(a) Titan’s indemnification obligations under **Section 8.1** of the Parent Agreement extend to any bodily injury, property damage, or third‑party claims arising from Titan’s performance of the Enhanced Services or operation of building systems associated with those services; and  

(b) Contoso’s indemnification obligations under **Section 8.2** of the Parent Agreement extend to any bodily injury, property damage, or third‑party claims arising from Contoso’s use or occupancy of the Premises during the Extended Term, including any use of additional access cards, badges, or security features.

8.3 **Indemnification Procedures.** The procedures for indemnification outlined in **Section 8.3** of the Parent Agreement, including notice, control of defense, settlement, and cooperation, shall apply to indemnification claims arising under this Amendment.

8.4 **Exclusive Remedies.** The Parties reaffirm that the indemnification obligations set forth in this Article VIII and the limitations of liability in **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment constitute the Parties’ sole and exclusive remedies with respect to third‑party claims, except for claims based on fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

## ARTICLE IX  
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Amended Liability Cap.** Notwithstanding **Section 9.1** of the Parent Agreement (which caps liability at two times the total fees paid during the preceding twelve months), and in light of the **Low Risk Profile** for this Amendment and the more client‑favorable approach requested by Contoso, the Parties agree that, for claims arising out of or relating specifically to this Amendment and the Extended Term:

(a) The total aggregate liability of either Party, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall not exceed an amount equal to **three (3) times the total fees (including Base Rent and Additional Rent) actually paid by Contoso to Titan under the Parent Agreement and this Amendment during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**; and  

(b) For avoidance of doubt, in calculating such liability cap, amounts paid for the Extended Term shall be included.

9.2 **Exclusion of Consequential Damages.** The exclusion of consequential, incidental, special, exemplary, and punitive damages set forth in **Section 9.2** of the Parent Agreement shall continue to apply, except as otherwise provided in **Section 9.3** of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment.

9.3 **Exceptions to Limitations.** The exceptions to the liability limitations listed in **Section 9.3** of the Parent Agreement (third‑party bodily injury or property damage claims, gross negligence or willful misconduct, payment obligations, and breaches of confidentiality) shall apply equally to this Amendment. The Parties agree that:

(a) Any service credits provided under **Article XII** of the Parent Agreement or this Amendment shall be applied as a credit mechanism and shall **not** count toward the liability cap; and  

(b) Nothing in this Amendment is intended to reduce or limit Titan’s liability for its gross negligence or willful misconduct in managing life‑safety systems.

9.4 **Risk Allocation.** The Parties acknowledge and agree that the liability cap and exclusions set forth in this Article IX, as modified by this Amendment, reflect a negotiated allocation of risk consistent with a **Low-risk engagement** and the economic terms of the Amended Term.

## ARTICLE X  
INSURANCE

10.1 **Continuation of Insurance Obligations.** The Parties reaffirm the insurance obligations set forth in **Article X (Insurance)** of the Parent Agreement. Titan shall maintain the coverage specified in **Section 10.1**, and Contoso shall maintain the coverage specified in **Section 10.2**, for the entire Amended Term, including the Extended Term.

10.2 **Updated Insurance Requirements.** Without limiting the generality of Section 10.1 above:

(a) Titan shall ensure that its commercial general liability insurance, property insurance, workers’ compensation, and umbrella or excess liability coverages remain in effect without lapse through at least **sixty (60) days after the new Expiration Date**; and  

(b) Contoso shall maintain commercial general liability insurance naming Titan as an additional insured with respect to Contoso’s occupancy and use of the Premises during the Extended Term, and property insurance covering Contoso’s personal property and equipment within the Premises.

10.3 **Certificates of Insurance.** Consistent with **Section 10.3** of the Parent Agreement, each Party shall provide updated certificates of insurance upon request, evidencing coverage through the Extended Term. Where commercially available, policies shall require at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other Party of cancellation or material reduction in coverage.

10.4 **Subrogation Waiver.** The waiver of subrogation set forth in **Section 10.4** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to any loss occurring during the Amended Term. Each Party shall ensure that its insurers are informed of this Amendment and the continued waiver of subrogation between the Parties.

## ARTICLE XI  
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Applicability.** The data protection provisions set forth in **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)** of the Parent Agreement, including compliance with **GDPR** and **CCPA** where applicable, shall apply fully to any processing of personal data in connection with the Enhanced Services (e.g., access control logs, CCTV footage, incident reports).

11.2 **Data Controller and Processor Roles.** Titan shall continue to act as an independent data controller with respect to personal data collected through building systems as described in **Section 11.3** of the Parent Agreement. Any processing of personal data on behalf of Contoso (as controller) shall be governed by a separate data processing addendum, to the extent required by Applicable Law.

11.3 **Data Security.** Titan shall maintain technical and organizational measures appropriate to the nature, scope, and risk of its processing activities, consistent with **Section 11.4** of the Parent Agreement, and shall ensure that the Enhanced Services (including expanded security reporting) do not reduce the level of protection afforded to personal data.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a Data Breach, as defined in **Section 11.5** of the Parent Agreement, Titan shall notify Contoso in accordance with that Section. Where the Data Breach relates specifically to personal data pertaining to Contoso’s personnel or visitors, Titan shall provide sufficient detail relating to the Premises and relevant systems to enable Contoso to comply with any notification obligations under GDPR, CCPA, or other Applicable Law.

11.5 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Titan shall retain access control and CCTV data for periods consistent with security and compliance requirements, and in accordance with **Section 11.6** of the Parent Agreement. Upon Contoso’s reasonable written request and subject to Applicable Law, Titan shall cooperate to provide or delete specific personal data related to Contoso’s personnel, where technically feasible and legally permitted.

## ARTICLE XII  
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)

12.1 **Reference to Parent SLA Framework.** The SLA framework in **Article XII** of the Parent Agreement (Sections 12.1–12.5) remains in full force and effect. This Article XII of the Amendment introduces SLA Enhancements tailored to the Amended Term and the Enhanced Services.

12.2 **Uptime for Critical Systems.** Titan shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain availability of critical building systems (power, HVAC, access control) at **99.9%** uptime per calendar month, as stated in **Section 12.2** of the Parent Agreement. For the Extended Term, Titan acknowledges that system reliability is critical to Contoso’s operations and shall:

(a) Notify Contoso in advance of any planned maintenance that could impact uptime, wherever reasonably practicable; and  

(b) Provide post‑incident reports for any outage exceeding sixty (60) minutes, explaining root cause and remedial actions.

12.3 **Response and Resolution Times.** The priority levels and target response and resolution times in **Section 12.3** of the Parent Agreement shall continue to apply. Additionally, during the Extended Term:

(a) For **Priority 1 (Critical)** issues affecting life safety or complete loss of access, Titan shall respond **within thirty (30) minutes during Business Hours** and pursue immediate mitigation;  

(b) For **Priority 2 (High)** issues, Titan shall provide Contoso with an estimated time to resolution within four (4) Business Hours of initial response; and  

(c) Titan shall provide status updates at reasonable intervals, upon request, for any open Priority 1 or Priority 2 tickets.

12.4 **Service Credits; Enhanced Client Remedies.** The service credit regime in **Section 12.4** of the Parent Agreement (credits up to 5% of monthly Base Rent) is confirmed. In addition:

(a) If Titan fails to meet the 99.9% uptime commitment in three (3) or more calendar months within any rolling twelve‑month period during the Amended Term, Contoso may, upon written notice, request a **joint remediation plan**, and Titan shall cooperate in good faith to implement such plan;  

(b) Persistent and material SLA violations (including systemic failure to meet Priority 1 response and resolution targets) may constitute grounds for termination for cause under **Section 4.4(b)(i)** of the Parent Agreement, as referenced in **Section 4.4** of this Amendment; and  

(c) Service credits shall be Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy for isolated SLA failures not rising to the level of a material breach; provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply to SLA failures caused by Titan’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

12.5 **Reporting.** Titan shall provide SLA reports as set forth in **Section 2.4(d)** of this Amendment and **Section 12.5** of the Parent Agreement. Such reports shall be used in operational review meetings and may form the basis for any remediation plans or change requests under **Article XIII**.

## ARTICLE XIII  
CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may request changes to the Enhanced Services, the scope of building system configurations affecting the Premises, or other aspects of this Amendment (each a “Change Request”) in accordance with **Section 13.1** of the Parent Agreement.

13.2 **Impact Assessment.** Upon receiving a Change Request, the receiving Party shall evaluate the request and provide an impact assessment in accordance with **Section 13.2** of the Parent Agreement, indicating feasibility, impact on SLAs, timelines, and any associated fees.

13.3 **Approval and Implementation.** No Change Request shall be binding unless agreed in writing by authorized representatives of both Parties, consistent with **Section 16.2 (Amendments)** of the Parent Agreement.

13.4 **Emergency Changes.** Titan may enact emergency changes to maintain safety or structural integrity as permitted under **Section 13.4** of the Parent Agreement, provided that Titan promptly notifies Contoso and consults regarding any long‑term or permanent changes that materially impact the Premises or Contoso’s operations.

## ARTICLE XIV  
DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.** In the event of any dispute arising out of or relating to this Amendment, the Parties shall follow the negotiation and escalation procedures set forth in **Section 14.1** of the Parent Agreement. Either Party may invoke executive‑level discussions by written notice describing the dispute.

14.2 **Mediation.** If the dispute is not resolved through negotiation within thirty (30) days, either Party may request mediation in accordance with **Section 14.2** of the Parent Agreement. The mediator should be experienced in commercial real estate and services contracts; familiarity with lease amendments is preferred.

14.3 **Litigation; Venue.** If mediation does not resolve the dispute, either Party may proceed to litigation in accordance with **Section 14.3** and **Section 16.12** of the Parent Agreement. The Parties agree that any litigation shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in **New Castle County, Delaware**.

14.4 **Injunctive Relief.** Either Party may seek injunctive or equitable relief, including specific performance, at any time as permitted by **Section 14.3(b)** of the Parent Agreement, without first engaging in mediation, where necessary to prevent irreparable harm, including enforcement of confidentiality or non‑interference with critical building systems.

15.2 **Extended Force Majeure.** The provisions of **Section 15.3** of the Parent Agreement regarding extended Force Majeure events (material impairment for more than thirty (30) days and potential termination after ninety (90) days) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the Amended Term. For the sake of clarity, if a Force Majeure Event materially impairs Contoso’s use of the Premises for more than ninety (90) days, either Party may terminate both the Parent Agreement and this Amendment on thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, without penalty except for accrued amounts and any contractually agreed early termination fees.
