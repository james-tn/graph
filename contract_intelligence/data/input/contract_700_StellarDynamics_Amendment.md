3.2.2 The first quarterly instalment of the Revised Base Rent shall fall due on the first day of the calendar quarter immediately following the Amendment Effective Date, calculated on a pro rata basis if the Amendment Effective Date does not coincide with the start of a quarter.

3.3 **Service Charges and Operating Expenses.**

3.3.1 The estimated annual **Service Charge** described in Section 3.3 of the Parent Agreement shall be increased to reflect Client’s occupation of the Extended Premises. Effective as of the Amendment Effective Date, the estimated annual Service Charge shall be **US$150,000** (one hundred fifty thousand United States dollars), subject to the same reconciliation and adjustment procedures as in Section 3.3.2 of the Parent Agreement.

3.3.2 Vendor shall continue to provide an annual reconciliation of actual operating expenses versus Service Charge estimates, as set forth in Section 3.3.2 of the Parent Agreement, and such reconciliations shall encompass costs attributable to the Extended Premises.

  (a) subject to the fee structure and billing approach set forth in **Section 3.4 (IT and Network Service Fees)** of the Parent Agreement; and

3.7.2 Given the **high risk profile** and expanded scope of the Lease and Services, the Parties acknowledge that timely payment of invoices under the Revised Payment Terms is of the essence. Any failure by Client to pay undisputed amounts within the Net 30 period may be considered a material breach for purposes of Section 4.4 of the Parent Agreement (Termination for Cause).

3.8 **Reimbursable Expenses.** Section 3.10 of the Parent Agreement (Reimbursable Expenses) shall apply equally to any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Vendor in connection with the Extended Premises or Additional Services, provided such expenses are pre-approved in writing by Client.

## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Incorporation of Parent Data Protection Terms.**

The Parties reaffirm and incorporate by reference **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)** of the Parent Agreement, including Sections 11.1–11.6, and agree that such provisions apply equally to any personal data processing in connection with this Amendment and the Additional Services.

11.2 **Data Processing for Additional IT and Network Services.**

11.2.1 To the extent Vendor processes personal data on behalf of Client in connection with upgraded IT and network services on the Extended Premises (including enhanced connectivity and security monitoring), Client remains the “controller” and Vendor the “processor” under UK GDPR/GDPR, as set out in Section 11.2 of the Parent Agreement.

11.2.2 Vendor shall maintain appropriate technical and organisational security measures commensurate with the increased data flows and dependency on IT services as described in this Amendment, and shall notify Client of any **personal data breach** affecting such Additional Services in accordance with Section 11.4 of the Parent Agreement.

11.3 **Retention and Deletion.**

Client shall determine appropriate data retention periods and instruct Vendor accordingly. Vendor shall comply with Client’s written instructions regarding deletion or return of personal data upon termination or expiry of the Parent Agreement as amended, subject to any legal retention obligations, in accordance with Section 11.3.6 and Section 11.6 of the Parent Agreement.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs) – ENHANCEMENTS

12.1 **General.**

12.1.1 The Service Levels set out in **Article XII of the Parent Agreement** (Sections 12.1–12.5) shall apply to the Extended Premises and Additional Services, subject to the enhancements in this Article XII.

12.2 **Uptime Commitments (Enhanced).**

12.2.1 For the Extended Premises, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that:

  (a) **Power supply** to the Extended Premises and critical IT infrastructure is available at least **99.95%** of the time in each calendar month;  
  (b) **Network connectivity** (including Internet access provided by Vendor) is available at least **99.95%** of the time in each calendar month; and  
  (c) Building access and security systems serving the Extended Premises are available at least **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month.

12.2.2 For the avoidance of doubt, the enhanced 99.95% uptime commitment supersedes the 99.9% target specified in Section 12.2 of the Parent Agreement solely with respect to IT and network services for the Extended Premises.

12.3 **Response and Resolution Times.**

Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to adhere to the incident response and resolution targets set out in **Section 12.3 of the Parent Agreement**. For critical incidents affecting Level 9 that result in a complete loss of IT services for more than 50% of Client’s users, Vendor will treat such incidents as **Priority 1 (Critical)** regardless of the availability of services elsewhere in the building.

12.4 **Service Credits (Additional).**

12.4.1 In addition to the service credits specified in Section 12.4 of the Parent Agreement, if Vendor fails to meet the enhanced uptime commitments for the Extended Premises in any calendar month, Client shall be entitled to the following credits on the monthly IT and network service fees attributable to the Extended Premises:

  (a) Uptime between 99.5% and 99.95%: **5%** credit;  
  (b) Uptime between 99.0% and 99.5%: **10%** credit;  
  (c) Uptime below 99.0%: **20%** credit.

12.4.2 Service credits under this Article XII shall be cumulative with, but not duplicative of, credits under Section 12.4 of the Parent Agreement, and together constitute Client’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for Service Level failures, without prejudice to Article IX (uncapped liability) for other types of loss.

12.5 **Planned Maintenance.**

Vendor’s obligations with respect to planned maintenance in **Section 12.5 of the Parent Agreement** (advance notice, scheduling outside Business Hours, and minimising disruption) shall apply specifically to any maintenance affecting Level 9 and the Extended Premises.

---

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Incorporation of Change Management Provisions.**

The Change Management provisions in **Article XIII of the Parent Agreement** (Sections 13.1–13.4) shall apply in full to any changes relating to the Extended Premises or Additional Services under this Amendment.

13.2 **Additional Change Scenarios.**

13.2.1 Without limitation, the Parties acknowledge the following as likely scenarios for Change Requests under this Amendment:

  (a) Further expansion or reduction of floor space within the building (e.g., partial surrender of Level 9);  
  (b) Additional IT capacity, redundancy enhancements, or specialised technical rooms;  
  (c) Changes to security systems or access controls specific to the Extended Premises.

13.2.2 Any such changes shall be documented in a **Change Order** that references both the Parent Agreement (LSE-STE-202509-680 / contract_680) and this Amendment (AMD-STE-202509-700), and shall specify scope, fees, timelines, and any impact on Service Levels.

The Dispute Resolution provisions set forth in **Article XIV (Dispute Resolution)** of the Parent Agreement, including Sections 14.1–14.5 (good faith negotiations, escalation, mediation, arbitration, and interim relief), shall apply to any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Amendment and/or the Parent Agreement, including any question regarding its existence, validity, or termination.

14.2 **Consolidation of Disputes.**

To the extent legally possible and procedurally appropriate, any Dispute relating to this Amendment shall be consolidated with related disputes under the Parent Agreement so as to avoid inconsistent findings and promote efficient resolution.

## ARTICLE XV  
## FORCE MAJEURE

15.1 **Force Majeure Events.**

The definition and consequences of a **Force Majeure Event** set out in **Article XV of the Parent Agreement** (Sections 15.1–15.3) shall apply mutatis mutandis to this Amendment. A Force Majeure Event affecting Level 9 or the Extended Premises shall be treated as a Force Majeure Event affecting the Premises under the Parent Agreement.

15.2 **Extended Force Majeure.**

If a Force Majeure Event materially affecting Vendor’s ability to provide the Lease and Services in the Extended Premises persists for more than ninety (90) consecutive days, either Party may exercise its rights of termination in accordance with Section 4.5 of the Parent Agreement, which will result in termination of both the Parent Agreement and this Amendment.
