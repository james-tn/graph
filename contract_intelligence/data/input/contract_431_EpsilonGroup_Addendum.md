## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **No Cap on Liability.**  

Notwithstanding **Section 9.2 (Aggregate Liability Cap)** of the Parent Agreement, and in light of the High Risk Arrangement and critical business impact of the Additional Leased Space, the Parties expressly agree that **THERE SHALL BE NO CONTRACTUAL CAP ON EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY** under this Addendum, except as may be otherwise mandated by applicable law.

9.2 **Consequential and Indirect Damages.**  

In deviation from **Section 9.1** of the Parent Agreement, the Parties further agree that **CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AS WELL AS LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUE, SHALL NOT BE EXCLUDED** under this Addendum and may be recoverable to the extent they are proven and not otherwise limited by law. Each Party knowingly and voluntarily assumes the increased risk and potential exposure associated with this provision.

9.3 **Interaction with Parent Agreement.**  

For any claims arising solely under the Parent Agreement and not involving the Additional Leased Space or Addendum Services, the limitations and exclusions in **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement shall continue to apply. For any claims arising from or related to this Addendum, this Article IX shall control in the event of any conflict.

9.4 **Exceptions and Mandatory Laws.**  

Nothing in this Addendum shall limit liability that cannot be limited under applicable law, such as liability for death or bodily injury caused by a Party’s negligence, consistent with **Section 9.3** of the Parent Agreement.

## ARTICLE X  
## INSURANCE

10.1 **Insurance Requirements.**  

Epsilon shall maintain the insurance coverages required by **Article X** of the Parent Agreement, including Commercial General Liability, Professional Liability, Workers’ Compensation, and Cyber Liability.

10.2 **Additional Insured; Certificates.**  

Upon Contoso’s reasonable request, Epsilon shall name Contoso as an additional insured under the Commercial General Liability policy with respect to liabilities arising from Addendum Services, consistent with **Section 10.2** of the Parent Agreement, and shall provide updated certificates demonstrating such coverage.

10.3 **No Limitation.**  

Epsilon’s insurance shall not limit its obligations or uncapped liability under this Addendum, in accordance with **Section 10.3** of the Parent Agreement, except to the extent insurance proceeds are actually applied to satisfy such obligations.

## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Applicability.**  

To the extent Epsilon processes Personal Data in connection with the Addendum Services (e.g., data collected via Addendum Leased Assets, logs from monitoring tools, or user directories related to Additional Leased Space), the data protection provisions in **Article XI** of the Parent Agreement shall fully apply.

11.2 **Additional Data Processing Terms.**

## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)

12.1 **Uptime Commitments.**  

(a) For critical Addendum Leased Assets and systems identified in Schedule C, Epsilon shall provide a minimum monthly uptime of **99.95%**, measured 24x7, excluding scheduled maintenance and Force Majeure Events, which is more stringent than the 99.9% baseline in **Section 12.1** of the Parent Agreement.

12.2 **Response and Resolution Times (Enhanced).**  

For incidents affecting the Additional Leased Space, Epsilon shall meet or exceed the following response and resolution times, which modify or supplement **Section 12.2** of the Parent Agreement:

(a) **Priority 1 – Critical Incidents** (complete loss of service in critical Additional Leased Space impacting key operations):

- Initial response: within **30 minutes** of notification (24x7).

- Availability between 99.5% and 99.95%: 5% credit on monthly Addendum Fees for affected assets;  
- Availability between 99.0% and 99.5%: 10% credit;  
- Availability below 99.0%: 15% credit.

(b) Service credits shall be applied to future Addendum invoices and are not a penalty but a price adjustment representing reduced service value. Credits are in addition to, and not in lieu of, other contractual remedies available under this Addendum and the Parent Agreement, except that double recovery is not permitted.

12.4 **Exclusions and Reporting.**  

Exclusions from SLA calculations and reporting obligations under **Section 12.4** of the Parent Agreement apply to this Addendum. Epsilon shall provide monthly SLA reports for the Additional Leased Space, detailing uptime, incidents, and remediation actions.

12.5 **Chronic Failure.**  

If Epsilon fails to meet the enhanced uptime commitment for critical Additional Leased Space in at least three (3) months within any rolling six (6) month period, Contoso may treat such chronic failure as a material breach, subject to the cure process and termination rights in **Section 4.4** of the Parent Agreement and **Section 4.4** of this Addendum.
