2.4.3 Contoso shall review each Deliverable within the period specified in the applicable SOW (or, if not specified, within ten (10) Business Days of receipt). If Contoso reasonably determines that a Deliverable does not materially conform to the agreed acceptance criteria, Contoso shall notify Epsilon in writing, specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for rejection. Epsilon shall, at no additional cost, use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformities and resubmit the Deliverable for review within a mutually agreed period. If Contoso fails to respond within the applicable review period, the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted.

2.5.1 Epsilon shall perform the Services in a diligent, professional, and workmanlike manner consistent with generally accepted industry standards for similar consulting services and in accordance with all Applicable Laws.

2.5.2 Epsilon shall ensure that its personnel assigned to perform the Services are suitably qualified, experienced, and trained, and that they devote sufficient time and resources to the Services to meet the obligations set forth in this Agreement and the applicable SOW.

2.6.1 Contoso shall provide Epsilon with timely access to all Client Materials, personnel, systems, facilities, and information reasonably required by Epsilon to perform the Services.

2.7 **Non-Solicitation of Personnel**. During the Term and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, neither Party shall, without the prior written consent of the other Party, directly solicit for employment any individual who has been directly involved in the performance of the Services, provided that this shall not prohibit general recruitment activities not specifically targeted at such individuals.

11.2 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws**. Each Party shall comply with its respective obligations under Data Protection Laws. Epsilon shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, as set out in this Agreement, the applicable SOW, or other written instructions issued by Contoso from time to time, unless required to do otherwise by Applicable Law, in which case Epsilon shall inform Contoso of that legal requirement before processing, unless prohibited from doing so by Applicable Law.

11.3.5 assist Contoso, at Contoso’s cost, in responding to requests from data subjects and in complying with its obligations under Data Protection Laws, including with respect to security, breach notifications, impact assessments, and consultations with supervisory authorities;

11.3.7 make available to Contoso all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Article XI and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by Contoso or its designated auditor, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations.

11.4 **International Transfers**. Epsilon shall not transfer Personal Data outside the UK or the European Economic Area (EEA) without Contoso’s prior written consent.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification**.  

11.5.1 In the event of a personal data breach (as defined under Data Protection Laws) affecting Personal Data processed by Epsilon on behalf of Contoso (a **“Data Breach”**), Epsilon shall: (a) notify Contoso without undue delay and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours of becoming aware of the Data Breach; (b) provide Contoso with all information reasonably available to Epsilon regarding the nature and consequences of the Data Breach; and (c) take all reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of the Data Breach and to prevent its recurrence.

11.5.2 Contoso shall be responsible for determining whether notification of the Data Breach is required under Data Protection Laws and for making any such notifications to supervisory authorities and/or affected data subjects, except to the extent that Applicable Law clearly places such responsibility on Epsilon.

11.6 **CCPA-Specific Provisions**. To the extent that Epsilon processes Personal Data subject to the CCPA on behalf of Contoso, Epsilon shall: (a) act as a “service provider” (as defined under the CCPA); (b) not sell or share such Personal Data; (c) not retain, use, or disclose such Personal Data for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the Services or as otherwise permitted under the CCPA; and (d) notify Contoso if it determines that it can no longer meet its obligations under the CCPA.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion**. Epsilon shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes of processing under this Agreement or as required by Applicable Law.

12.2 **Service Availability**. To the extent Epsilon provides ongoing support or advisory services accessible via online platforms or communication channels, Epsilon shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such services are available at least **99.9%** of the time during normal service hours specified in the SOW, excluding scheduled maintenance and any downtime caused by: (a) Contoso’s acts or omissions; (b) Force Majeure Events; or (c) failures of internet service providers or other Third Party systems outside Epsilon’s reasonable control.

12.3 **Response and Resolution Times**. Epsilon shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to and resolve support requests within the following target timeframes (unless different metrics are specified in the SOW):

12.4 **Service Credits**. If Epsilon materially fails to meet the Service Levels set forth in this Article XII or in the applicable SOW in any calendar month, Contoso may be entitled to service credits, as specified in the SOW. Service credits shall be Contoso’s exclusive remedy for Service Level failures, without prejudice to Contoso’s rights under Article IV (Termination) in the event of repeated or persistent failures.

12.5 **Chronic Failure**. If Epsilon fails to meet any critical Service Level in three (3) consecutive calendar months, or in four (4) or more calendar months in any rolling twelve (12) month period, Contoso may, upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, terminate the affected SOW without penalty, in addition to any service credits due.

14.2 **Escalation Procedure**.  

14.2.1 Either Party may initiate the escalation procedure by providing written notice of the Dispute to the other Party’s project manager.

If the Dispute has not been resolved within thirty (30) Business Days after escalation to senior executives, either Party may propose that the Parties attempt to resolve the Dispute through non-binding mediation in London, United Kingdom, under the mediation rules of the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) or such other mediation rules as the Parties may agree. If the Parties agree to mediation, they shall share the mediator’s fees and mediation costs equally.

15.2 **Relief from Performance**. A Party affected by a Force Majeure Event shall not be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement or otherwise liable for any delay in or failure of performance to the extent that such delay or failure is caused by the Force Majeure Event, provided that the affected Party: (a) promptly notifies the other Party in writing of the Force Majeure Event and its expected duration and impact; and (b) uses reasonable endeavours to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event and resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable.

15.3 **Prolonged Force Majeure**.
