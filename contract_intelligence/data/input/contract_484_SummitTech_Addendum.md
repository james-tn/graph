2.1 **Relationship to Parent DPA.**  

2.1.1 This Addendum is entered into pursuant to, and expressly **supplements and amends**, the Parent DPA (**DPA-SUM-202409-479 / contract_479**), including, without limitation, **Article II (Scope of Services and Data Processing)** and **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)**.  

2.1.2 For the avoidance of doubt, all Additional Processing Activities described in this **Article II** shall be treated as “Processing” of “Personal Data” performed by Summit Tech as a **Processor/Service Provider** on behalf of Contoso as **Controller/Business**, as described in **Section 2.1 (Relationship of the Parties)** of the Parent DPA.  

2.1.3 Except as explicitly modified in this Addendum, all terms and conditions of the Parent DPA, including Contoso’s responsibilities in **Section 2.4 (Client Responsibilities)** and the Instruction framework in **Section 2.5 (Contoso Instructions)**, apply in full to the Additional Services.

2.2 **Enhanced Analytics Services.**  

Summit Tech shall provide Enhanced Analytics Services to Contoso, which extend and deepen the analytics and reporting capabilities described in **Section 2.3.3 (Analytics and Reporting)** of the Parent DPA. The Enhanced Analytics Services shall include, at a minimum:

2.2.1 **Advanced Segmentation and Cohort Analysis.** Summit Tech will implement advanced segmentation logic enabling Contoso to group Data Subjects (e.g., Contoso’s customers, prospects, and employees) into dynamic cohorts based on behavioral, transactional, and engagement attributes. Segmentation criteria may include purchase history, product usage patterns, marketing engagement, support interactions, and other data elements provided by Contoso.

2.2.2 **Predictive Modeling and Scoring.** Summit Tech shall develop and configure predictive models using machine‑learning and statistical methods to generate risk scores, propensity scores, churn likelihood, or other predictive indicators, using Personal Data as input, solely for Contoso’s internal business purposes and in accordance with Contoso’s Instructions. Any modeling shall be conducted in compliance with **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)** of the Parent DPA and **Article XI** of this Addendum.

2.2.3 **Experience Personalization Support.** Summit Tech will provide APIs, configuration capabilities, and data exports that allow Contoso to utilize analytics outputs and scores for personalization within Contoso’s own systems (e.g., targeted messaging, product recommendations). Summit Tech shall not itself conduct cross‑context behavioral advertising or sell or share Personal Data, in accordance with **Section 7.3(c)** and **Section 11.9** of the Parent DPA.

2.2.4 **Operational Dashboards and Executive Reporting.** Summit Tech will design and configure additional dashboards and executive reports providing aggregated insights, trend lines, KPIs, and drill‑down capabilities, leveraging the Enhanced Analytics Services. These Deliverables shall be provided in accordance with **Section 2.3.3** and **Article VI (Intellectual Property Rights)** of the Parent DPA and **Article VI** of this Addendum.

2.2.5 **Performance Standards.** Summit Tech shall perform the Enhanced Analytics Services: (a) consistent with the performance standards in **Section 2.3.6 (Performance Standards)** of the Parent DPA; (b) using personnel with appropriate skill and experience; and (c) in a manner designed to avoid material degradation of the core Services and SLAs described in **Article XII (Service Level Agreements)** of the Parent DPA and this Addendum.

2.3 **Additional Data Ingestion and Integration.**  

In addition to the data ingestion and integration activities described in **Section 2.3.2 (Data Ingestion and Integration)** of the Parent DPA, Summit Tech shall:

2.3.1 **Connect Additional Data Sources.** Implement secure connectors, ETL processes, or API integrations to ingest Personal Data from Additional Data Sources specified in the Project Plan, which may include:  
(a) customer support systems (e.g., ticketing or helpdesk solutions);  
(b) marketing automation and campaign management tools;  
(c) limited HR and workforce management systems for employee engagement analytics (subject to **Section 2.4.2** below); and  
(d) other systems mutually agreed in writing by the Parties.

2.3.2 **Schema Mapping and Data Normalization.** Map data fields from the Additional Data Sources into Summit Tech’s data model, harmonizing identifiers across systems, and ensuring data quality checks. Contoso shall remain responsible for the legal basis and lawfulness of Processing, consistent with **Section 2.4 (Client Responsibilities)** of the Parent DPA.

2.3.3 **Data Minimization and Configuration Controls.** Provide configuration options that allow Contoso to control which data fields are ingested and processed, implementing data minimization principles consistent with Data Protection Laws. The Parties shall cooperate to ensure that sensitive or “special category” data (as referenced in **Section 2.2.4** of the Parent DPA) is not ingested or processed unless expressly authorized under **Section 2.4.3** of this Addendum.

2.4 **New Categories of Personal Data.**

2.4.1 **Customer Support and Interaction Data.** In addition to the types of Personal Data outlined in **Section 2.2.4** of the Parent DPA, Contoso may provide:  
(a) support case metadata (ticket IDs, timestamps, channel, product identifiers);  
(b) interaction notes that may include Personal Data such as names, business contact details, and summaries of customer issues; and  
(c) limited communication transcripts where necessary for analytics and quality analysis, subject to pseudonymization or redaction where feasible.

2.4.2 **Employee Engagement Data (Limited).** Contoso may elect to provide limited employee‑related data for internal analytics, including:  
(a) business contact information, role, department, and region;  
(b) system usage metadata (login timestamps, features used); and  
(c) survey responses or feedback that are not inherently sensitive, to be processed in aggregated or pseudonymized form where reasonably possible.  
Summit Tech is not authorized to process special category employee data (e.g., health data, union membership, or other sensitive data) unless the Parties execute a further written amendment setting out additional safeguards.

2.4.3 **Explicit Exclusion of Sensitive Data Unless Agreed.** The restriction in **Section 2.2.4** of the Parent DPA concerning sensitive or “special category” data remains in effect. Any deviation (e.g., processing of biometric or health‑related data) must be (a) explicitly agreed in writing by both Parties; (b) documented as a change under **Article XIII (Change Management)** of this Addendum; and (c) subject to enhanced safeguards consistent with **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)** of the Parent DPA.

2.5 **New Categories of Data Subjects.**

The Additional Processing Activities may involve the following New Categories of Data Subjects, which supplement **Section 2.2.5** of the Parent DPA:

2.5.1 **Customer Support Contacts.** Individuals who contact Contoso’s support channels, including customers, prospects, or other end‑users.

2.5.2 **Prospective Employees (Limited).** In the event Contoso elects to upload limited data regarding prospective employees (e.g., candidate IDs, interview stages) solely for pipeline analytics, such Data Subjects shall be considered within scope, provided that Contoso ensures compliance with applicable employment and privacy laws.

2.5.3 **Contoso Internal Users for Analytics.** Administrative and business users within Contoso whose usage data (e.g., login, feature clicks) may be analyzed to optimize training, adoption, and system configuration.

2.6 **Implementation, Project Plan, and Timeline.**

2.6.1 **Project Plan.** Within thirty (30) days of the Addendum Effective Date, the Parties shall mutually finalize a Project Plan detailing: (a) the Additional Data Sources to be integrated; (b) milestones for configuration and deployment of Enhanced Analytics Services; (c) testing and validation steps; and (d) responsibilities of each Party.

These target dates are subject to Contoso’s timely provision of required access, data samples, and personnel cooperation.

2.6.3 **Acceptance of Deliverables.** For any configured dashboards, analytics models, or integration deliverables, Contoso shall have fifteen (15) Business Days to review and either (a) provide written acceptance; or (b) provide a written list of non‑conformities. Summit Tech shall remedy any material non‑conformity without additional charge, after which Deliverables shall be deemed accepted unless Contoso reasonably objects in writing within ten (10) Business Days.

2.7 **Relationship to Existing Services.**  

The Additional Services are provided as an extension of the Services (as defined in **Section 1.15** of the Parent DPA) and shall be subject to the same general Performance Standards, security obligations, and SLAs, as modified or supplemented by **Article XII** of this Addendum. Nothing in this Addendum diminishes Summit Tech’s existing obligations to:
