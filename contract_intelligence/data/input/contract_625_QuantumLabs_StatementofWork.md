  - Response Time: within 1 hour (24x7).

  - Impact: Minor issues, cosmetic defects, or general inquiries.  
  - Response Time: within 2 Business Days.  
  - Resolution targeted in next scheduled release or maintenance window.

12.4 **SLA Credits.** If Service Availability for any calendar month falls below the applicable target, Client shall be eligible to receive a service credit (“**Credit**”) as follows:

Credits are Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet Service Availability targets.

12.6 **Chronic SLA Failures.** If Vendor fails to meet the monthly Service Availability target in three (3) or more months in any rolling twelve (12) month period, Client may, in addition to any Credits, elect to:
