3.1 **Addendum Contract Value; Addendum Base Rent.**

3.1.1 The Parties acknowledge and agree that the estimated **Addendum Contract Value** for the Expanded Premises over the Addendum Term is **US$2,344,549**. This amount represents the aggregate of Addendum Base Rent, estimated Operating Expenses, Taxes, and other anticipated charges for the Expanded Premises during the Addendum Term, in addition to the Contract Value under the Parent Agreement.

3.1.2 For the Expanded Premises, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, without offset or deduction except as expressly provided in the Parent Agreement or this Addendum, **Addendum Base Rent** in accordance with the following schedule (illustrative but deemed agreed for purposes of this Addendum, subject to any updated Rent Schedule attached as **Exhibit C‑1**):

3.1.3 The Base Rent figures above are structured on a monthly basis and deemed to align with the Addendum Contract Value. To the extent of any discrepancy, **Exhibit C‑1 (Addendum Rent Schedule)**, once mutually executed, shall control.

3.1.4 Base Rent under the Parent Agreement shall continue to be due and payable as stated therein, as supplemented by this Addendum. Where there is a conflict between the Parent Agreement and this Addendum regarding the Base Rent or the term of payment for the Expanded Premises, this Addendum shall govern with respect to the Expanded Premises.

3.2 **Additional Rent; Operating Expenses and Taxes for Expanded Premises.**

3.2.1 In addition to Addendum Base Rent, Tenant shall pay its **Proportionate Share** of Operating Expenses and Taxes as **Additional Rent**, calculated on the basis of the **Expanded Premises**. Tenant’s Proportionate Share shall be:

\[
\text{Proportionate Share} = \frac{38{,}000 \text{ RSF}}{\text{Total Rentable Square Footage of the Building}}
\]

as reasonably determined by Landlord, consistent with **Section 3.2.1** of the Parent Agreement.

3.2.2 Landlord shall provide Tenant with an annual **Operating Expense and Tax Estimate** that reflects the Expanded Premises, in accordance with **Section 3.2.2** of the Parent Agreement. Tenant shall pay one-twelfth (1/12) of its estimated share monthly, together with Base Rent, adjusted to the **Net 60** payment terms described in **Section 3.4.1** of this Addendum.

3.2.3 The year-end reconciliation procedure set forth in **Section 3.2.3** of the Parent Agreement shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the Expanded Premises, with Tenant’s overpayments credited or refunded and underpayments due within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the reconciliation statement.

3.3 **Definition and Treatment of Operating Expenses.**

3.3.1 The definition of “Operating Expenses” set forth in **Section 3.3** of the Parent Agreement applies to all charges under this Addendum. For the avoidance of doubt:

  (a) Operating Expenses include all reasonable costs for utilities to Common Areas, Building systems, janitorial services, security, property management fees, insurance premiums, and capital expenditures that are required by changes in law or reduce Operating Expenses, amortized consistent with GAAP;  

  (b) Operating Expenses exclude Landlord’s income taxes, depreciation (except as expressly permitted), capital improvements unrelated to the Building’s operation, leasing commissions, and costs attributable solely to other tenants.

3.4 **Invoicing and Payment Terms (Net 60).**

3.4.1 **Modification of Section 3.4.1 of Parent Agreement.** Solely with respect to amounts payable under this Addendum, **Section 3.4.1** of the Parent Agreement (which established “Net 45” terms) is hereby **amended** to provide that all amounts due from Tenant to Landlord under this Addendum shall be payable within **sixty (60) days** after Tenant’s receipt of each invoice (**“Net 60”**), unless otherwise expressly stated in this Addendum or the Parent Agreement. For clarity, this Net 60 term applies to Base Rent, Additional Rent, and all other charges arising from or relating to the Expanded Premises.

3.4.2 Invoices shall continue to be sent to Tenant’s Accounts Payable Department as specified in **Section 3.4.2** of the Parent Agreement, unless Tenant provides updated billing contact information in accordance with **Section 16.7** of the Parent Agreement.

3.5 **Late Payments; Interest and Charges.**

3.5.1 The late payment provisions of **Section 3.5** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to all past-due amounts under this Addendum, including interest at the lesser of **1% per month (12% per annum)** or the maximum rate allowed by law, and Landlord’s right to impose a late fee of up to 5% of the overdue amount, charged once per delinquent invoice.

3.5.2 For avoidance of doubt, the Net 60 term modifies only the due date; the calculation of interest and late fees otherwise follows **Section 3.5** of the Parent Agreement.

3.6 **Disputed Amounts.**

3.6.1 Tenant’s right to dispute invoices in good faith under **Section 3.6** of the Parent Agreement—by written notice within thirty (30) days of receipt, timely paying undisputed portions, and resolving disputes through **Article XIV (Dispute Resolution)**—shall apply fully to charges under this Addendum.

3.7 **Security Deposit / Additional Credit Support.**

3.7.1 If Landlord has required or may require a security deposit or letter of credit under **Section 3.7** and **Exhibit D** of the Parent Agreement, Landlord may, in its commercially reasonable discretion (given the High Risk Allocation and the expanded value of this Addendum), require an **increase** in the security deposit or the issuance of an **additional letter of credit** or amendment to the existing letter of credit to reflect the increased financial exposure. Any such adjustment shall be documented in a written amendment to **Exhibit D**.

4.3 **Termination for Convenience.**

4.3.1 **Modification of Section 4.3.** Notwithstanding **Section 4.3.1** of the Parent Agreement (which allows either Party to terminate for convenience upon 60 days’ notice), in light of the High Risk Allocation and the substantial Fit‑Out Work and Addendum Contract Value associated with the Expanded Premises, the Parties agree that:

  (a) Tenant may terminate this Addendum and the Parent Agreement **for convenience** only upon at least **one hundred eighty (180) days’ prior written notice** to Landlord; and

4.4.2 If Tenant commits an Event of Default under the Parent Agreement, such Event of Default shall constitute an Event of Default under this Addendum, and vice versa. Landlord’s remedies under **Section 4.5** of the Parent Agreement, including termination and recovery of damages, shall apply to the Expanded Premises.

4.5 **Effect of Termination of Parent Agreement.**

4.5.1 The Parties expressly agree that this Addendum **supplements and amends** the Parent Agreement and does not constitute a standalone lease. Accordingly, **if the Parent Agreement is terminated or expires for any reason**, this Addendum shall **automatically terminate** on the same effective date, without the need for separate notice, and Tenant shall surrender the entire Expanded Premises in accordance with **Section 4.6** of the Parent Agreement and **Section 4.6** of this Addendum.

4.6 **Surrender and Holding Over.**

4.6.1 Upon expiration or earlier termination of the Addendum Term, Tenant shall vacate and surrender the **Expanded Premises** to Landlord in a neat, clean, and orderly condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and shall remove Tenant’s personal property and any Alterations or Tenant Improvements that Landlord has required to be removed, in accordance with **Section 4.6.1** of the Parent Agreement.

4.6.2 If Tenant fails to vacate the Expanded Premises on or before the Addendum Expiration Date or effective termination date, such occupancy shall be deemed a **month-to-month tenancy** under the same terms and conditions, except Rent shall be **150% of the then-current Base Rent plus Additional Rent** for the Expanded Premises, as provided in **Section 4.6.2** of the Parent Agreement.
