## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

### 11.1 Compliance with Data Protection Laws  

Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its processing of Personal Data under this Agreement.

### 11.2 Processing of Personal Data  

The Service Provider shall:

11.2.1 Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from the Company, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a Third Country (as defined in GDPR), unless required to do so by Applicable Law, in which case the Service Provider shall inform the Company of that legal requirement unless prohibited by law;

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

### 12.1 General  

The Service Provider shall provide the Services in accordance with the service levels set forth in this Article XII. The Parties acknowledge that these service levels are intended to provide measurable performance standards consistent with a medium‑risk engagement.

### 12.2 Service Availability  

12.2.1 The Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the core systems supported under this Agreement are operational and available **99.9%** of the time during each calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance (as defined below) and excused downtime due to Force Majeure Events or the Company’s actions or omissions.

12.2.2 “Scheduled Maintenance” means planned maintenance activities that may require temporary interruption of Services. The Service Provider shall provide the Company with at least three (3) Business Days’ advance notice of Scheduled Maintenance that is expected to cause service degradation or downtime, and shall schedule such maintenance during non‑peak hours where reasonably feasible.

### 12.3 Incident Priority Levels and Response/Resolution Times  

Incidents shall be classified by the Company, subject to the Service Provider’s reasonable review, according to the following priority levels:

- **Priority 1 (Critical):** Complete outage or severe degradation of critical system(s) affecting a significant portion of the Company’s operations, with no reasonable workaround.  
- **Priority 2 (High):** Significant functionality is impaired or performance is substantially degraded, impacting business operations but with a workaround available.  
- **Priority 3 (Medium):** Non‑critical issue with limited business impact; system remains operational.  
- **Priority 4 (Low):** Minor issue, cosmetic defect, or informational request.

The Service Provider shall adhere to the following target Response and Resolution Times:

| Priority | Response Time (Max) | Resolution Time (Target) |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| P1      | 1 hour (24x7)       | 8 hours                  |
| P2      | 4 Business Hours    | 1 Business Day           |
| P3      | 1 Business Day      | 5 Business Days          |
| P4      | 2 Business Days     | As agreed / next release |

### 12.4 Service Credits  

12.4.1 If the Service Provider fails to meet the monthly service availability target (Section 12.2.1) by more than 0.5% in any calendar month, the Company shall be entitled to a Service Credit equal to 5% of the monthly equivalent of the annual base maintenance fee for each 0.5% of unexcused downtime below the 99.9% target, up to a maximum of 20% of such monthly equivalent in any given month.

12.4.2 To receive a Service Credit, the Company must notify the Service Provider in writing within thirty (30) days following the month in which the Service Level failure occurred, reasonably detailing the basis for the claim. Service Credits shall be applied against the next invoice(s) issued to the Company or, if no further invoices are due, shall be refunded within sixty (60) days.

12.4.3 Service Credits shall be the Company’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for failure to meet the service availability target, but shall not limit the Company’s right to terminate for persistent material failures pursuant to Section 4.3.2 or to seek other remedies for unrelated breaches.

### 14.2 Mediation  

If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation and escalation as provided above, the Parties shall, before initiating any legal action (except for injunctive relief), attempt to resolve the Dispute through non‑binding mediation administered by a mutually agreed mediator. The mediation shall be conducted in Delaware, USA, unless the Parties mutually agree to an alternative location or a virtual format.

### 14.3 Litigation / Venue  

If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days from the appointment of a mediator, either Party may pursue any remedies available at law or in equity. Subject to any mandatory arbitration agreement the Parties may later adopt by amendment:

14.3.2 Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection to venue or forum non conveniens.

### 14.4 Interim Relief  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary or preliminary injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm, misuse of Confidential Information, or infringement of Intellectual Property Rights, without first resorting to negotiation, escalation, or mediation.
