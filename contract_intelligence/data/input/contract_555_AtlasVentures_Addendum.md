4.2.3 **Pass-Throughs and Capital Expenditures.** Any capital expenditures permitted to be included in Operating Expenses under Section 3.3.1(i) of the Parent Agreement that directly benefit the Expanded Premises (e.g., energy efficiency upgrades servicing the 11th floor) may be reasonably allocated to Tenant’s Proportionate Share, subject to amortization in accordance with GAAP and applicable lease accounting.
