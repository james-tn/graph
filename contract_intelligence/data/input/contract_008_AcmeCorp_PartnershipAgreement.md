2.3 **Performance Standards.**  
(a) Acme shall perform all Services in a professional, diligent, and workmanlike manner, in accordance with generally accepted industry standards, the Specifications, and all applicable laws and regulations.  

(b) Acme shall assign personnel with appropriate skills, qualifications, and experience to perform the Services, and shall ensure that such personnel devote sufficient time and attention to meet the agreed timelines and milestones.

2.5 **Contoso Responsibilities.**  
Acme’s performance is dependent upon Contoso’s timely and effective cooperation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Contoso shall:

  (a) provide Acme with timely access to relevant personnel, facilities, systems, data, and information reasonably required for the performance of the Services;

Contoso shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Acme and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, the “Acme Indemnitees”) from and against any Losses arising out of or relating to any claim by a third party that:

  (a) the Contoso Materials or Contoso’s use of the Deliverables and Work Product (in a manner not caused by Acme’s breach of this Agreement) infringes, misappropriates, or violates such third party’s rights;  

  (b) Contoso’s gross negligence or willful misconduct caused bodily injury or death to any person or damage to tangible property; or  

  (c) Contoso’s violation of applicable laws in connection with its use of the Services or Deliverables.

8.3 **Indemnification Procedures.**  
The obligations of an indemnifying Party (“Indemnifying Party”) under this Article VIII are conditioned upon the party seeking indemnification (“Indemnified Party”) (a) promptly notifying the Indemnifying Party in writing of any claim for which indemnification is sought (provided that any delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it is materially prejudiced by such delay); (b) granting the Indemnifying Party sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (except that the Indemnifying Party may not settle any claim in a manner that imposes any liability or admission of fault on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and (c) providing the Indemnifying Party with reasonable cooperation and assistance, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense.

8.4 **Infringement Mitigation.**  
If any Deliverable, Work Product, or Service is, or in Acme’s reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of a third‑party infringement claim, Acme may, at its option and expense, either: (a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using such Deliverable, Work Product, or Service; (b) replace or modify it so that it becomes non‑infringing while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the applicable SOW and refund to Contoso any prepaid Fees for the period following the termination date and any Fees paid for the allegedly infringing Deliverables or Services, less a reasonable allocation for use prior to such termination.

8.5 **Exclusive Remedy.**  
The indemnification obligations set forth in this Article VIII and the infringement mitigation remedies in Section 8.4 shall be the Parties’ exclusive obligations and remedies with respect to any third‑party claim of infringement, misappropriation, or violation of Intellectual Property rights, subject to the limitations set forth in Article IX.

## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its processing of Personal Data under this Agreement.

The Parties shall share equally the mediator’s fees and expenses.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days after initiation, either Party may pursue its rights and remedies in accordance with Section 16.7.
