Vendor’s indemnification obligations in **Article VIII of the Parent Agreement**, including **Section 8.1 (IP Infringement and Gross Negligence)** and **Section 8.4 (IP Infringement Remedies)**, shall apply to Maintenance Services performed under this Maintenance Agreement. In particular, Vendor shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the **Client Indemnified Parties** from and against any third-party Claims arising out of: (a) an allegation that Maintenance Deliverables, as provided by Vendor and used by Client in accordance with this Agreement, infringe or misappropriate any third-party IP rights; or (b) Vendor’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with Maintenance Services.

8.2 **Client Indemnification.**  
In addition to the Client indemnification obligations in **Section 8.2 of the Parent Agreement**, Client shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the **Vendor Indemnified Parties** from and against all Claims arising out of or relating to:

(a) Client’s misuse of the Maintenance Services, Maintenance Tools, or Maintenance Deliverables;  

(b) Client’s failure to implement security-related Updates or instructions provided by Vendor, to the extent such failure materially contributes to the Claim; and  

(c) Client’s breach of **Article VI (Intellectual Property Rights)** of this Agreement or of **Article VI of the Parent Agreement**.

## ARTICLE IX  
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **High-Risk Arrangement – No Contractual Cap.**  
In light of the **High Risk** nature of this Maintenance Agreement and the Parties’ express agreement to allocate risk accordingly, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that **no aggregate monetary cap** shall apply to either Party’s liability arising out of or relating to this Maintenance Agreement or the Maintenance Services. For clarity, the liability cap in **Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement** (three times the fees paid or payable in the preceding twelve (12) months) **does not apply** to claims arising under this Maintenance Agreement.

9.2 **Consequential and Similar Damages.**  
Given the High Risk designation and the Parties’ risk allocation:

(a) **Vendor-Favorable Inclusion.** The Parties acknowledge that both direct and certain categories of **indirect, consequential, incidental, and special damages**, including without limitation loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of goodwill, and loss of data, may be recoverable to the extent actually incurred and proven, except as otherwise limited in this Article.  

(b) However, neither Party shall be liable to the other for purely speculative or punitive damages, except to the extent such damages are awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction to a third party and indemnified under **Article VIII**.

9.3 **Certain Exceptions.**  
Without limiting anything in **Section 9.1**, and for avoidance of doubt, there is no limitation of liability (cap or exclusion) for:

(a) A Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII** (as supplemented by this Agreement and the Parent Agreement);  

(b) Client’s payment obligations under **Article III** of this Agreement and **Article III of the Parent Agreement**;  

(c) A Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct;  

(d) A Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under **Article V** of this Agreement or **Article V of the Parent Agreement**; and  

(e) A Party’s data protection obligations under **Article XI** of this Agreement or **Article XI of the Parent Agreement**, to the extent such obligations are mandated by applicable law and not subject to contractual limitation.

9.4 **Multiple Claims.**  
The existence of multiple claims or suits shall not serve to impose any cap where none exists; the Parties understand that, due to the absence of a contractual cap, each claim may add to overall exposure.

9.5 **Applicability of Parent Agreement Provisions.**  
To the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this **Article IX**, the principles in **Article IX of the Parent Agreement** (including **Section 9.4**) shall apply.

## ARTICLE X  
INSURANCE

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**
