Each SOW shall be deemed incorporated into and governed by this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and an SOW, the terms of this Agreement shall control unless the SOW expressly states that it is intended to supersede a specific provision of this Agreement, in which case such SOW shall prevail solely with respect to the subject matter therein.

2.4 **Performance Standards.** Epsilon shall perform the Services:

  2.4.1 In a professional and workmanlike manner, consistent with generally accepted industry standards and practices for comparable services;

  2.4.2 In compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including Data Protection Laws, to the extent applicable to Epsilon’s performance of the Services;

2.6 **Acceptance of Deliverables.**

  2.6.1 Upon Epsilon’s delivery of any Deliverable, Contoso shall have a period of **fifteen (15) Business Days** (or such other period as may be specified in the applicable SOW) to review and test such Deliverable to determine whether it materially conforms to the applicable specifications and acceptance criteria.

  2.6.2 If Contoso reasonably determines that a Deliverable fails to meet the applicable acceptance criteria in any material respect, Contoso shall notify Epsilon in writing within the review period, specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the non-conformity. Epsilon shall, at no additional cost to Contoso (except as mutually agreed in a Change Order in the event the requested modifications are outside the original scope), promptly use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformities and re-deliver the Deliverable.

  2.6.3 Contoso shall then have an additional review period (of up to fifteen (15) Business Days, unless otherwise agreed) to test the corrected Deliverable. This process may be repeated a reasonable number of times, not to exceed three (3) rounds of remediation, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

11.2 **Data Processing Instructions.** Epsilon shall process personal data only on documented instructions from Contoso, including with respect to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by applicable law. In such case, Epsilon shall inform Contoso of that legal requirement before processing, unless prohibited by that law on important grounds of public interest.

  11.4.1 Epsilon imposes on such subprocessors data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement; and

  11.4.2 Epsilon remains responsible for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors as if they were its own.

Upon Contoso’s reasonable request, Epsilon shall provide a list of subprocessors used in connection with the Services.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a confirmed breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data processed by Epsilon on behalf of Contoso (a “**Data Breach**”), Epsilon shall:

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Epsilon shall retain personal data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by applicable law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Contoso’s written request, Epsilon shall delete or return personal data in its possession or control, except to the extent retention is required by law or as permitted under **Section 5.4.3**.

11.9 **CCPA / CPRA Requirements.** Where the CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, applies, the Parties agree that Epsilon acts as a “service provider” (or “contractor,” as applicable) with respect to personal information processed on behalf of Contoso. Epsilon shall not:

  11.9.2 Retain, use, or disclose personal information for any purpose other than to provide the Services or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA/CPRA; or

## ARTICLE XIV. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good-Faith Negotiations.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a “**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal discussions between their respective project managers or primary points of contact.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek immediate injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm, including for breaches of **Article V** or unauthorized use of Intellectual Property Rights, without first complying with the negotiation and mediation steps set forth in this **Article XIV**.
