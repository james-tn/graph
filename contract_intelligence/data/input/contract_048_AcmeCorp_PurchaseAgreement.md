The Parties agree that the scope is intended to support Contoso’s enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, and related business operations.

   c. **Configuration and Customisation.** Configure the Acme Suite in accordance with the approved design, including setting up user roles, workflows, business rules, and reporting templates. If custom development is required (e.g., custom fields, scripts, or integrations), such work shall be detailed in a separate SOW and subject to Change Management under Article XIII.  
   d. **Integration Services.** Integrate the Acme Suite with Contoso’s existing systems (e.g., HR, legacy ERP, CRM, email, identity management) using available APIs or middleware, as described in the SOW.  
   e. **Data Migration.** Plan and execute data migration from specified legacy systems into the Acme Suite, including data mapping, cleansing guidance, and test migrations. Contoso shall remain responsible for data quality and validation, while Acme shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure accurate and complete migration as per jointly agreed mapping specifications.

2.4 **Testing and Acceptance.**

2.4.1 **Testing.** Acme shall conduct unit tests and system integration tests on its own environment prior to user acceptance testing (“UAT”). Following completion of these internal tests, Acme shall support Contoso in conducting UAT in a non-production environment.

2.4.2 **Acceptance Criteria.** Each Deliverable and Milestone shall have written acceptance criteria set forth in the applicable SOW. Unless otherwise specified, Contoso shall have fifteen (15) Business Days from delivery of a Deliverable or completion of a Milestone to review and either (i) provide written acceptance, or (ii) provide a written list of deficiencies specifying in reasonable detail how the Deliverable fails to meet the acceptance criteria.

2.4.3 **Remedy of Defects.** In the event Contoso notifies Acme of deficiencies within the review period, Acme shall, at its own cost and as Contoso’s exclusive remedy for a failure to meet acceptance criteria (subject to Article IX), promptly correct the deficiencies and resubmit the Deliverable for acceptance. The Parties shall repeat the review and correction cycle until acceptance is achieved or the Parties mutually agree otherwise in writing.

2.4.4 **Deemed Acceptance.** If Contoso fails to respond within the applicable review period and thereafter uses the Deliverable in a live production environment, such Deliverable shall be deemed accepted, provided that such deemed acceptance shall not limit Contoso’s rights under the warranties in Article VII.

2.5 **Training.** Acme shall provide training Services to Contoso’s designated personnel, including at minimum:

   a. Administrator training on configuration, user management, and system monitoring;  
   b. End-user training for key functional modules;  
   c. Provision of training materials (user guides, quick reference cards, and online resources).  

Training formats (on-site, remote, recorded sessions) and volumes shall be specified in the applicable SOW.

2.6 **Support and Maintenance Services.** During the Term, and subject to payment of applicable Fees, Acme shall provide support and maintenance for the Acme Suite as follows:

   a. **Helpdesk Support.** Provide a helpdesk available during Business Hours (09:00–17:30 UK time, Monday through Friday, excluding UK public holidays) by email and web portal. Severity levels, response times, and resolution targets shall be set out in Article XII.  
   b. **Bug Fixes and Updates.** Provide patches, bug fixes, and minor updates to maintain the Acme Suite in substantial conformity with its documentation. Major upgrades may be subject to additional Fees if so specified in the SOW.  
   c. **Preventive Maintenance.** Plan and conduct routine maintenance windows in accordance with Article XII, providing Contoso with at least five (5) Business Days’ prior notice for planned downtime, except in emergencies.

   a. with due skill, care, and diligence;  
   b. in a timely and professional manner consistent with industry best practices for enterprise software implementation and support;  
   c. using personnel who are appropriately qualified, experienced, and trained; and  
   d. in compliance with all Applicable Laws and Contoso’s reasonable policies notified in writing (including security and data protection policies).

2.8 **Cooperation and Dependencies.** Contoso shall:

   a. provide timely access to relevant personnel, systems, and information reasonably required by Acme to perform the Services;  
   b. perform its responsibilities as set out in the SOWs (e.g., provision of test data, participation in UAT, sign-offs); and  
   c. ensure that its IT environment meets the minimum technical requirements specified by Acme.

Delays or failures by Contoso to perform its obligations that materially impact Acme’s performance shall entitle Acme, after reasonable notice and consultation, to a reasonable extension of time and, where justified, a mutually agreed adjustment to Fees, as processed under Article XIII. This does not limit Contoso’s rights where Acme fails to meet its obligations.

2.9 **Statements of Work.** The Parties may enter into one or more SOWs under this Agreement that will further describe Products, Services, Deliverables, timelines, Milestones, acceptance criteria, and Fees. Each SOW shall, upon execution by both Parties, form an integral part of this Agreement and be governed by its terms. In the event of conflict, the order of precedence shall be as set forth in Section 16.11.

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Role of the Parties.** For the purposes of Data Protection Laws, the Parties acknowledge that Contoso shall be the **controller** (or equivalent term) and Acme shall be the **processor** (or equivalent term) with respect to any Personal Data processed by Acme on behalf of Contoso under this Agreement.

11.2 **Processing Obligations.** Acme shall:

   a. process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, including as set out in this Agreement, any SOW, and Contoso’s written instructions, unless required to do so by Applicable Law;

11.3 **Sub‑Processors.** Contoso authorises Acme to engage sub‑processors to process Personal Data on Contoso’s behalf, provided that:

   a. Acme enters into a written agreement with each sub‑processor imposing data protection obligations that are no less protective than those set out in this Article XI;  
   b. Acme remains fully liable to Contoso for the acts and omissions of its sub‑processors; and
