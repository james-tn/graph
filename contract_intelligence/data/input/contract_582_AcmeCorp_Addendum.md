A Party seeking indemnification under this Article VIII (the **"Indemnified Party"**) shall:

8.3.1 Promptly notify the other Party (the **"Indemnifying Party"**) in writing of any claim for which indemnification is sought, provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent it is materially prejudiced;

8.4.1 Modify the Work Product so that it is non-infringing while maintaining equivalent functionality;  
8.4.2 Replace the Work Product with non-infringing alternatives of equivalent functionality; or  
8.4.3 If neither of the above is commercially reasonable, terminate the relevant portion of the Services and refund to the Client the Fees paid for the infringing portion of the Work Product, less a reasonable depreciation for use.

8.5 **Exclusions.**  
The Vendor shall have no indemnity obligations for infringement claims to the extent they arise from:

8.5.1 Modifications to the Work Product made by the Client or any third party not authorised by the Vendor;
