  - (b) Vendor is the **data processor** (or equivalent term under Applicable Data Protection Laws).

11.2 **Data Processing.** Vendor shall process Personal Data solely:
  - (a) on the documented instructions of Client, as set forth in this Addendum, the Master Agreement, and any SOW or Project Plan; and
  - (b) for the purposes of performing the Services and as otherwise required by Applicable Law.  
If Vendor is required by Applicable Law to process Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with Client’s instructions, Vendor shall, to the extent permitted by law, inform Client before processing.
