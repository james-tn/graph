DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in its performance of this Agreement.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Vendor may engage Subcontractors as subprocessors to process Personal Data on behalf of Client, provided that: (a) Vendor enters into a written agreement with each subprocessor requiring data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement; and (b) Vendor remains fully liable for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors.

11.5 **Cross-Border Transfers.** To the extent Vendor transfers Personal Data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions with data transfer restrictions to a country not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, Vendor shall ensure that such transfer is subject to appropriate safeguards in compliance with Data Protection Laws (e.g., standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, or equivalent).

11.6 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of any confirmed unauthorized access to, or acquisition, loss, or disclosure of, Personal Data processed by Vendor on behalf of Client (a “**Data Breach**”), Vendor shall:

  (a) Notify Client without undue delay and, where feasible, within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;

11.7 **Data Subject Rights.** Vendor shall, to the extent legally permitted and technically feasible, assist Client in responding to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability). If Vendor receives a request directly from a data subject relating to Personal Data processed on behalf of Client, Vendor shall promptly forward it to Client.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services, or as required by applicable law.

  - Service Availability below 98.0%: credit equal to 20% of the monthly fee for the affected service.

12.5 **Chronic SLA Failures.** If Vendor fails to meet the uptime commitment in three (3) or more months in any rolling six (6)-month period, Client may treat such failures as a material breach under Section 4.3, subject to the cure period therein.
