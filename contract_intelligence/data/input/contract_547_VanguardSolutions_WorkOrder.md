8.2 **Additional Indemnification – High‑Risk Engagement.**

8.2.1 Given the high‑risk nature of this Work Order, Client shall, in addition to the indemnity in **Section 8.2 of the MSA**, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Vendor Indemnitees from and against any Losses arising out of or in connection with any third‑party Claim to the extent resulting from:

  a. Client’s failure to implement or maintain security controls or operational processes that Vendor has expressly recommended in writing and that are documented as Client’s responsibility in the applicable design or run‑books;  
  b. Client’s use of the Platform or Deliverables in environments, jurisdictions, or use‑cases not contemplated in this Work Order or reasonably foreseeable to Vendor, where Vendor has provided prior written notice of the associated risks;  
  c. Any unauthorised changes or modifications to the Platform made by Client or its third‑party providers without Vendor’s prior written approval, where such changes materially contributed to the relevant Loss.

8.2.2 The indemnification procedure in **Section 8.4 of the MSA** shall apply to indemnification claims under this Article VIII.

8.3 **Vendor Indemnity – Extended.** Vendor’s indemnity obligations under **Section 8.1 of the MSA** remain in full force, including for IP infringement and material data protection breaches, provided that Vendor shall not be required to indemnify Client to the extent such Losses arise from Client’s failure to implement Vendor’s written security recommendations or from Client’s misuse of the Platform.
