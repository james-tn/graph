9.1 **Addendum Liability Cap.**  
Notwithstanding **Article IX of the Parent Agreement**, and in recognition of the **Medium Risk** classification for this Addendum, the Parties agree that, for claims arising solely out of or in connection with the Additional Premises and Addendum Services (and not the original Lease Premises):

(a) the aggregate liability of each Party to the other, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, shall be limited to an amount equal to **five (5) times the total fees (Base Rent – Addendum plus Service Charges – Addendum) actually paid by Contoso to Phoenix under this Addendum during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**; and  

(b) if the event giving rise to the claim occurs within the first twelve (12) months of the Addendum Term, the liability cap shall be deemed to be five (5) times the fees payable for the first twelve (12) months of the Addendum Term, based on the then-current charges.

9.2 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  
In relation to claims arising solely under this Addendum, **neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages (including loss of profit, loss of revenue, and loss of business)**, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, except to the extent such exclusion is prohibited by law. This provision modifies the approach in **Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement** solely for Addendum-related claims.

9.3 **Exceptions.**  
Nothing in this Addendum shall exclude or limit either Party’s liability for:

(a) death or personal injury caused by its negligence;  

(b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;  

(c) amounts payable under **Article VIII (Indemnification)** with respect to third-party claims relating to bodily injury or property damage;  

(d) any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

9.4 **Relationship with Parent Agreement Liability.**  
The limitations in this Article IX apply only to claims attributable to the Additional Premises and Addendum Services. Claims relating to the original Lease Premises or other aspects of the Parent Agreement shall be governed by **Article IX of the Parent Agreement**, including its uncapped liability regime.

(a) If Phoenix fails to meet the uptime or response/resolution targets in respect of the Additional Premises for two (2) consecutive quarters, Phoenix shall meet with Contoso to formulate a corrective action plan specific to the Additional Premises.

(b) If Phoenix fails to implement such plan within a reasonable time, Contoso shall be entitled to a **service credit not exceeding 5% of the monthly Service Charge – Addendum** for the affected quarter, which shall be applied as a credit against the next invoice.
