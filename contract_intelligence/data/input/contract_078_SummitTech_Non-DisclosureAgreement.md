   2.2.1 **Discovery and Requirements Analysis.**  
   Summit Tech shall conduct discovery sessions with Contoso’s business and technical stakeholders to gather detailed requirements regarding Contoso’s existing systems, desired functionality, integration points, security constraints, and compliance requirements.

This shall include: (a) system architecture diagrams (including network topology, components, and integration points); (b) data models and schema; (c) security and access control designs; (d) recommendations for third‑party platforms or services, if any; and (e) a migration and rollout strategy. Summit Tech shall present the proposed architecture to Contoso for review and shall incorporate reasonable feedback to reach a mutually agreed design baseline.

   2.2.3 **Software Development and Configuration.**  
   Summit Tech shall design, develop, configure, or customize software modules and components as required to implement the agreed solution architecture. This may include front‑end user interfaces, back‑end services, APIs, middleware integrations, data transformation logic, and scripts.

   Summit Tech shall support Contoso in the deployment of the solution into Contoso’s staging and production environments (whether on‑premises or in the cloud, as applicable). This shall include deployment planning, data migration assistance, cutover support, and post‑deployment monitoring during an agreed stabilization period.

   2.2.6 **Training and Knowledge Transfer.**  
   Summit Tech shall provide training to Contoso’s designated personnel on the use, administration, and maintenance of the Deliverables. Training may include live (in‑person or remote) sessions, prepared materials, and documentation.

Unless otherwise specified in an SOW, Contoso shall have ten (10) Business Days after delivery of a Deliverable (the “Review Period”) to accept or reject such Deliverable in writing, identifying any material non‑conformities. If Contoso fails to respond within the Review Period, the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted.

2.4 **Performance Standards.**  
Summit Tech shall perform the Services:

Summit Tech shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Contoso and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, “Contoso Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all third‑party claims, demands, suits, actions, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) (“Claims”) to the extent arising out of or relating to:

   (a) any allegation that the Work Product (excluding Third‑Party Materials and Contoso‑provided materials) infringes any third‑party Intellectual Property Right;  
   (b) Summit Tech’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of the Services; or  
   (c) Summit Tech’s material breach of its data security obligations under Article XI, resulting in unauthorized access to Client Data.

8.2 **Indemnification by Contoso.**  
Contoso shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Summit Tech and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, “Summit Tech Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all Claims to the extent arising out of or relating to:

   (a) any allegation that the Client Data or any materials provided by or on behalf of Contoso infringe any third‑party Intellectual Property Right or violate Applicable Law; or  
   (b) Contoso’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement.

8.3 **Indemnification Procedures.**  
The Party seeking indemnification (the “Indemnified Party”) shall promptly notify the other Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) in writing of any Claim for which it seeks indemnification. The Indemnifying Party shall have sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim, provided that: (a) the Indemnified Party may participate in the defense with its own counsel at its own expense; and (b) the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any admission of liability or payment obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. The Indemnified Party shall provide reasonable cooperation and assistance to the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of the Claim, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense.

8.4 **IP Infringement Mitigation.**  
If any Deliverable or Work Product is, or in Summit Tech’s reasonable opinion is likely to be, the subject of an infringement Claim, Summit Tech may, at its option and expense: (a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using the affected Work Product; (b) modify the Work Product so that it is non‑infringing while retaining substantially equivalent functionality; or (c) replace the Work Product with a non‑infringing alternative that provides substantially equivalent functionality. If none of the foregoing options is commercially reasonable in Summit Tech’s judgment, Summit Tech may terminate the applicable SOW with respect to the affected Work Product and refund to Contoso the Fees paid for such Work Product, less a reasonable allocation for use prior to termination.

8.5 **Exclusions.**  
Summit Tech shall have no indemnification obligation under this Article VIII to the extent that an infringement Claim arises from: (a) modifications to the Work Product made by or on behalf of Contoso without Summit Tech’s written approval; (b) combination of the Work Product with any products, services, or materials not provided or approved by Summit Tech; (c) use of the Work Product in breach of this Agreement or outside the scope expressly permitted herein; or (d) any Third‑Party Materials or materials provided by Contoso.

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Law relating to data protection, privacy, and information security, including, as applicable, GDPR and CCPA. To the extent Summit Tech processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso in connection with the Services, the Parties agree that Contoso shall be deemed the “controller” (or “business”) and Summit Tech shall be deemed the “processor” (or “service provider”) as those terms are defined under Applicable Law.

11.2 **Data Security.**  
Summit Tech shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Client Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures shall be consistent with industry standards and shall include, where appropriate: (a) access controls and authentication; (b) encryption of data in transit and at rest where reasonably practicable; (c) regular security patching and vulnerability management; (d) network security controls, including firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention; and (e) periodic security monitoring and logging.

11.3 **Use and Processing of Client Data.**  
Summit Tech shall process Client Data solely: (a) to perform the Services under this Agreement; (b) in accordance with Contoso’s documented instructions; and (c) as required by Applicable Law. Summit Tech shall not “sell” or “share” Client Data within the meaning of CCPA, nor shall Summit Tech use Client Data for any purpose other than providing the Services, including for its own marketing or profiling purposes, except as explicitly authorized in writing by Contoso.

11.4 **Subprocessors.**  
Summit Tech may engage subprocessors to assist in the provision of the Services, provided that Summit Tech: (a) enters into a written agreement with each subprocessor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set out in this Article XI; and (b) remains fully liable to Contoso for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Applicability.**  
This Article XII shall apply to any Services that involve the provision of hosted or managed software or systems by Summit Tech to Contoso (the “Hosted Services”) as may be specified in an SOW.

12.2 **Uptime Commitment.**  
Summit Tech shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Hosted Services are available at least **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and Permitted Downtime, as defined below (the “Uptime Commitment”).

12.3 **Scheduled Maintenance and Permitted Downtime.**  
“Scheduled Maintenance” means maintenance windows scheduled by Summit Tech that may cause temporary unavailability of the Hosted Services, provided that Summit Tech shall use reasonable efforts to schedule such maintenance outside of Contoso’s normal business hours and shall give Contoso at least forty‑eight (48) hours’ prior notice. “Permitted Downtime” means downtime caused by: (a) Scheduled Maintenance; (b) Force Majeure Events; (c) failures or issues in systems not controlled by Summit Tech (e.g., Contoso’s networks or third‑party services); or (d) Contoso’s misuse of the Hosted Services.

12.4 **Response and Resolution Times.**  
Summit Tech shall respond to and work to resolve incidents reported by Contoso in accordance with the following target response and resolution times, measured from the time of Contoso’s initial notification:

   - **Severity 1 (Critical – service unavailable or severely impacted):**  
     Response time: within 1 hour; Target resolution or workaround: within 4 hours.  
   - **Severity 2 (High – major functionality impaired):**  
     Response time: within 2 hours; Target resolution or workaround: within 1 Business Day.  
   - **Severity 3 (Medium – minor functionality issues):**  
     Response time: within 1 Business Day; Target resolution or workaround: within 5 Business Days.  
   - **Severity 4 (Low – cosmetic issues, general inquiries):**  
     Response time: within 2 Business Days; Resolution as reasonably scheduled.

12.5 **Service Credits.**  
If, in any calendar month, the actual uptime of the Hosted Services falls below the Uptime Commitment, Contoso shall be entitled to a service credit against future Fees for Hosted Services, calculated as a percentage of the monthly Fees for such Hosted Services for the affected month, as follows:

   - Uptime between 99.0% and 99.9%: 5% service credit  
   - Uptime between 98.0% and 99.0%: 10% service credit  
   - Uptime below 98.0%: 15% service credit  

Service credits shall be Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy (subject to Article IX) for failure to meet the Uptime Commitment, unless such failure constitutes a material breach that remains uncured in accordance with Section 4.4.

12.6 **Exclusions.**  
The SLAs set forth in this Article XII shall not apply to any unavailability or performance issues: (a) caused by factors outside Summit Tech’s reasonable control (including Force Majeure Events); (b) resulting from Contoso’s acts or omissions or Contoso’s failure to use the Hosted Services in accordance with the documentation; or (c) attributable to third‑party services or internet connectivity not controlled by Summit Tech.

13.2 **Evaluation and Impact Assessment.**  
Upon receiving a Change Request, Summit Tech shall promptly evaluate the requested changes and provide Contoso with a written impact assessment, including any adjustments to Fees, timelines, resources, dependencies, and risks. Contoso shall review the impact assessment and may approve, reject, or request modifications to the proposed Change.

13.3 **Change Orders.**  
No Change Request shall be effective unless and until memorialized in a Change Order executed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Each Change Order shall reference this Agreement and the applicable SOW and shall form part of this Agreement. Summit Tech shall not be obligated to implement a Change Request prior to execution of the applicable Change Order.

13.4 **Effect on Scope, Fees, and Timelines.**  
Approved Change Orders may result in increases or decreases in the scope of Services, Deliverables, Fees, and timelines. The Parties shall work together in good faith to minimize any adverse impact of changes, recognizing that certain changes may require additional time or cost.

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a “Dispute”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiations. If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days, either Party may escalate the Dispute to senior executives with decision‑making authority, who shall meet (in person or virtually) within fifteen (15) days to attempt to resolve the Dispute.

14.2 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation and escalation pursuant to Section 14.1 within forty‑five (45) days, either Party may request non‑binding mediation under the then‑current Commercial Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The mediation shall take place in **New York, New York, USA**, unless otherwise agreed, and shall be conducted in English. The Parties shall share equally in the mediator’s fees and expenses.

14.3 **Arbitration / Litigation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after the commencement of mediation, either Party may pursue any remedy available at law or in equity. For Disputes where the amount in controversy does not exceed US$250,000 (excluding interest and attorneys’ fees), the Parties agree to binding arbitration administered by the AAA under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, with a single arbitrator, in New York, New York. For Disputes exceeding such amount, either Party may bring an action in the state or federal courts located in New York, New York, and each Party hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such purposes.

14.4 **Interim Relief.**  
Nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking interim or provisional relief, including injunctive relief, from any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information or Intellectual Property Rights, or to prevent irreparable harm, pending final resolution of the Dispute.

14.5 **Attorneys’ Fees.**  
In any arbitration or litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, in addition to any other relief granted, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

15.2 **Notice and Mitigation.**  
The Party claiming relief under this Article XV shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, describing its nature and anticipated duration, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the Force Majeure Event and to resume performance as soon as practicable.

15.3 **Suspension of Obligations.**  
To the extent a Party is prevented or delayed from performing its obligations under this Agreement due to a Force Majeure Event, such obligations shall be suspended for the duration of the Force Majeure Event to the extent so prevented or delayed, and the time for performance shall be extended accordingly.

15.4 **Termination for Extended Force Majeure.**  
If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and materially affects the performance of the Services, either Party may terminate this Agreement or any affected SOW upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other Party, without further liability (except for payment obligations accrued prior to the effective date of termination).
