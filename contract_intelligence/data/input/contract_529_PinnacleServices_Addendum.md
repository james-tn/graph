To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and consistent with **Section 9.1** of the Parent DPA, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, or goodwill, arising out of or in connection with this Addendum, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.
