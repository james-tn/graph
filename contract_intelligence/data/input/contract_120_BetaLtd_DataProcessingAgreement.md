## ARTICLE XI  
### DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.**  
For purposes of Applicable Data Protection Law, Client acts as the Controller (and, where applicable, as a Business under the CCPA), and Vendor acts as the Processor (and, where applicable, as a Service Provider under the CCPA) with respect to the Processing of Personal Data under this Agreement.

11.2 **Processing on Instructions.**  
Vendor shall Process Personal Data only on documented Instructions from Client, as set forth in this Agreement, any SOW, or as otherwise documented in writing by Client from time to time. If Vendor believes an Instruction violates Applicable Data Protection Law, Vendor shall promptly notify Client and may suspend performance of the Instruction until the issue is resolved.

11.3 **Compliance with Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with Applicable Data Protection Law in connection with the Processing of Personal Data. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

  (a) Client shall be responsible for ensuring the lawfulness of Personal Data Processing, including obtaining all necessary consents and providing required notices to Data Subjects;  

  (b) Vendor shall assist Client in meeting its obligations with respect to data subject rights, security, and breach notification, as described in this Article XI.

11.4 **Security Measures.**  
Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data. Such measures shall, at a minimum, include:

  (a) access controls, authentication, and authorization mechanisms;  

  (b) encryption of Personal Data in transit over public networks and at rest where technically feasible and appropriate;  

  (c) regular security testing, vulnerability scanning, and patch management;  

  (d) physical security controls for facilities where Personal Data is stored; and  

  (e) employee confidentiality obligations and security awareness training.

Upon Client’s reasonable request, Vendor shall provide high‑level documentation of its security measures, which shall be deemed Vendor’s Confidential Information.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a Personal Data Breach affecting Personal Data Processed under this Agreement:

  (a) Vendor shall notify Client without undue delay, and in any event within seventy‑two (72) hours after becoming aware of the breach;  

  (b) such notification shall include, to the extent known at the time, a description of the nature of the breach, the categories and approximate number of Data Subjects and records affected, likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to address the breach;  

  (c) Vendor shall promptly investigate the breach, take appropriate remedial measures, and cooperate with Client in any required notifications to regulators or Data Subjects, subject to Client’s Instructions and Applicable Data Protection Law.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.**  
Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Vendor shall assist Client, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, in responding to requests from Data Subjects to exercise their rights under Applicable Data Protection Law (including rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, and objection). If Vendor receives a request directly from a Data Subject relating to Personal Data Processed on behalf of Client, Vendor shall promptly notify Client and shall not respond to the request except on Client’s Instructions, unless required by law.

11.7 **Data Protection Impact Assessments and Consultation.**  
Upon Client’s reasonable request and at Client’s expense, Vendor shall provide commercially reasonable assistance to Client in carrying out data protection impact assessments and, where necessary, prior consultations with supervisory authorities, in each case solely to the extent related to the Services and Vendor’s Processing of Personal Data on behalf of Client.

11.8 **Sub‑processors.**  
Client hereby authorizes Vendor to engage Sub‑processors to Process Personal Data on behalf of Client, provided that:

  (a) Vendor maintains a current list of Sub‑processors and shall make such list available to Client upon request;  

  (b) Vendor shall provide Client with prior notice (which may be by email or posting on a secure portal) of any intended addition or replacement of Sub‑processors, thereby giving Client the opportunity to object on reasonable grounds relating to data protection; and  

  (c) Vendor shall enter into written agreements with Sub‑processors imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set out in this Agreement.

In the event of a reasonable objection by Client to any new Sub‑processor, the Parties shall discuss in good faith alternative arrangements. If no agreement is reached within thirty (30) days, Client may terminate the affected Services upon written notice, without penalty and with a pro‑rated refund of any prepaid, unused Fees for the terminated Services.

11.9 **International Transfers.**  
Vendor shall not transfer Personal Data outside the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area (“EEA”) unless:

  (a) such transfer is to a country that has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data by the UK government or the European Commission;  

  (b) Vendor has implemented appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses approved by the relevant authority, or a valid data transfer framework; or  

  (c) the transfer is otherwise permitted by Applicable Data Protection Law.  

Upon request, Vendor shall provide Client with information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Section 11.9.

11.10 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services and fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, or as required by Applicable Data Protection Law. Upon termination or expiry of this Agreement, Vendor shall, at Client’s choice, delete or return all Personal Data, except to the extent Vendor is required to retain certain Personal Data under applicable law, in which case Vendor shall continue to protect such retained data in accordance with this Agreement.

11.11 **CCPA Supplier Terms (if applicable).**  
To the extent the CCPA applies:

  (a) Vendor shall act as a “Service Provider” as defined under the CCPA and shall not sell or share Personal Information (as defined by the CCPA) received from Client;  

  (b) Vendor is prohibited from retaining, using, or disclosing Personal Information for any purpose other than the specific purpose of performing the Services or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA; and  

  (c) Vendor shall not combine Personal Information it receives from Client with Personal Information received in other contexts, except as permitted under the CCPA.

11.12 **Audits.**  
Upon Client’s reasonable, written request, and subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations, Vendor shall make available to Client information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Article XI (such as summaries of independent audit reports, certifications, or questionnaires). Where Client reasonably believes additional audit measures are necessary, Client may conduct, or have conducted on its behalf by an independent third party, an audit of Vendor’s relevant data processing activities no more than once per year, upon at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice and during normal business hours, provided that such audit:

  (a) is limited to facilities, systems, and records relevant to the Processing of Personal Data under this Agreement;  

  (b) does not unreasonably interfere with Vendor’s business operations; and  

  (c) is at Client’s expense, unless the audit reveals a material non‑compliance with this Article XI, in which case Vendor shall bear the reasonable costs.
