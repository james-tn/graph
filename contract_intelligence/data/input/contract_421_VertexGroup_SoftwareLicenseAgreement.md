9.2 **Cap on Liability.**  
EXCEPT FOR (A) A PARTY’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER **ARTICLE VIII**; (B) A PARTY’S BREACH OF ITS CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER **ARTICLE V**; OR (C) CONTOSO’S OBLIGATION TO PAY FEES, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THREE (3) TIMES THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CONTOSO TO VERTEX UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY.

## ARTICLE XI. DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable data protection and privacy laws in connection with its performance under this Agreement, including, as applicable, the GDPR, CCPA, and similar laws in relevant jurisdictions.

11.2 **Role of the Parties.**  
To the extent that Vertex processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso in providing the Software and Services, the Parties acknowledge that Contoso is the “controller” (or equivalent term under applicable law) and Vertex is the “processor” (or equivalent term) of such Personal Data. The Parties shall, if required by applicable law, enter into a separate data processing agreement or addendum that governs such processing and is incorporated into this Agreement by reference.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
Vertex shall maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Client Data (including Personal Data) against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, such data. Such measures shall be no less protective than those used by Vertex to protect its own similar data and shall comply with applicable law and industry best practices for data security.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure, or breach of security affecting Client Data (a “**Data Breach**”), Vertex shall:

  (a) notify Contoso without undue delay and, in any event, within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  

  (b) provide reasonable information available to Vertex regarding the nature of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of affected data subjects, and reasonable steps taken or proposed to remedy or mitigate the Data Breach; and  

  (c) cooperate with Contoso, at Contoso’s reasonable request and at Vertex’s expense to the extent the Data Breach results from Vertex’s failure to comply with this Agreement, in investigating the Data Breach and in complying with any notification obligations under applicable law.

11.5 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Vertex shall retain Client Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Software and Services or as required by applicable law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Vertex shall, at Contoso’s written request and subject to **Section 4.6(e)**, delete or return Client Data in its possession or control, except to the extent retention is required by law or for backup and archival purposes in accordance with Vertex’s standard retention policies, in which case such retained data shall remain subject to the confidentiality and data protection obligations herein.

11.6 **Subprocessors.**  
Vertex may engage third-party subprocessors to assist in providing the Software and Services, provided that Vertex shall (i) impose on such subprocessors data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement; and (ii) remain responsible for the acts and omissions of such subprocessors to the same extent as if performed by Vertex itself. Upon Contoso’s written request, Vertex shall provide a list of current subprocessors.

## ARTICLE XII. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Uptime Commitment.**  
For any hosted or cloud-based deployment of the Software, Vertex shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make the production environment of the Software available with a monthly **Uptime Percentage of at least 99.9%**, excluding scheduled maintenance windows and downtime caused by factors beyond Vertex’s reasonable control (including Force Majeure Events, failures of third-party networks or systems, and Contoso-caused outages).

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  
Vertex may schedule routine maintenance windows during which the Software may be unavailable. Vertex shall use reasonable efforts to: (a) schedule routine maintenance during off-peak hours; and (b) provide Contoso with at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior notice of any scheduled maintenance expected to cause service unavailability.

12.3 **Response Times.**  
Vertex shall provide technical support during its standard support hours (which shall be communicated to Contoso in writing). Vertex shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to support requests within the following target timeframes:

  - **Severity 1 (Critical – system down)**: Initial response within 1 hour; continuous efforts to resolve.  
  - **Severity 2 (High – major functionality impaired)**: Initial response within 4 hours; work in progress until resolved or workaround provided.  
  - **Severity 3 (Medium – non-critical issue)**: Initial response within 1 Business Day.  
  - **Severity 4 (Low – minor issue, questions)**: Initial response within 2 Business Days.

These timeframes are targets and not guarantees but will be treated as service level objectives.

12.4 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.**  
If, in any calendar month, Vertex fails to meet the Uptime Percentage specified in **Section 12.1**, Contoso may be eligible for service credits, calculated as a percentage of the monthly license or subscription Fees for the affected Software, as follows:

  - Uptime 99.0% – < 99.9%: 5% service credit;  
  - Uptime 98.0% – < 99.0%: 10% service credit;  
  - Uptime < 98.0%: 20% service credit.

Service credits shall be applied to future invoices and shall not be redeemable for cash. Service credits are Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the uptime commitment in **Section 12.1**, except in cases of persistent, material SLA failures that may give rise to termination rights under **Article IV**.

12.5 **Exclusions.**  
The SLA obligations in this **Article XII** do not apply to performance issues arising from: (a) factors outside Vertex’s reasonable control; (b) any actions or inactions of Contoso or third parties under Contoso’s control; (c) Contoso’s equipment, software, or other technology; or (d) scheduled maintenance or emergency maintenance necessary to protect the security or integrity of the Software.

## ARTICLE XIII. CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  
Either Party may request changes to the scope of the Services, Deliverables, timelines, or other aspects of this Agreement or any SOW by submitting a written change request (“**Change Request**”) to the other Party. The Change Request shall describe the proposed change, its rationale, and any anticipated impact on Fees, schedules, and resources.

13.2 **Evaluation and Approval.**  
Upon receipt of a Change Request, the Parties shall meet (in person or virtually) to discuss the proposed change and its impact. Vertex shall provide Contoso with a written estimate of any adjustments to Fees, timelines, or other conditions resulting from the proposed change. No Change Request shall be effective unless agreed in writing by authorized representatives of both Parties (a “**Change Order**”).

13.3 **Impact on Project Schedule.**  
If a Change Order is executed, the Parties shall adjust the project schedule, milestones, and Deliverables as necessary. Vertex shall not be obligated to commence work on any requested change until the associated Change Order has been executed.

13.4 **No Implied Changes.**  
Absent a signed Change Order, Vertex shall perform the Services and deliver the Deliverables in accordance with the existing scope set forth in this Agreement and any applicable SOWs. Contoso acknowledges that any work performed by Vertex in response to informal or undocumented change requests may be billed as additional Services at Vertex’s then-current rates if not otherwise covered by a signed Change Order.

## ARTICLE XIV. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute by negotiation between senior executives of the Parties. Either Party may initiate such informal dispute resolution by providing written notice of the dispute to the other Party. The Parties’ designated executives shall meet (in person or virtually) within ten (10) Business Days of such notice to attempt to resolve the dispute.

14.2 **Mediation.**  
If the dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days after the date of the initial notice under **Section 14.1**, the Parties agree to attempt to settle the dispute through mediation administered by a mutually agreed mediator. The mediation shall occur in **Dallas County, Texas**, unless otherwise agreed, and the costs of mediation shall be shared equally by the Parties, except that each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and expenses.

14.3 **Litigation or Arbitration.**  
If the dispute is not resolved through negotiation or mediation within sixty (60) days after initiation of mediation, either Party may pursue any remedies available at law or in equity. For purposes of this Agreement, and in light of the medium risk level specified, the Parties agree that disputes may be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth below, unless the Parties mutually agree in writing to binding arbitration.

14.4 **Venue and Jurisdiction.**  
Subject to the foregoing negotiation and mediation requirements, any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in **Dallas County, Texas**, and each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts and waives any objection thereto on the basis of forum non conveniens or otherwise.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this **Article XIV** shall prevent either Party from seeking temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction in order to prevent or enjoin actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of its Intellectual Property Rights or breach of confidentiality obligations.

14.6 **Attorneys’ Fees.**  
In any action to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs from the non-prevailing Party, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.

A “**Force Majeure Event**” means any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of a Party, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics, war, terrorism, civil unrest, strikes, labor disputes (excluding those involving a Party’s own workforce), government actions, embargoes, power failures, failures of telecommunications or internet services not within a Party’s reasonable control, and other similar events that render performance impossible or commercially impracticable.

15.2 **Notice and Mitigation.**  
The Party affected by a Force Majeure Event shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of the occurrence and expected duration of the Force Majeure Event and the obligations affected. The affected Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the Force Majeure Event and to resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable.

15.3 **Suspension of Performance.**  
During the continuance of a Force Majeure Event, the obligations of the affected Party that cannot be performed due to such event shall be suspended to the extent of the delay caused by the Force Majeure Event. The Parties shall in good faith discuss and agree upon any appropriate adjustments to project schedules and milestones.

15.4 **Termination for Extended Force Majeure.**  
If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and materially prevents a Party from performing its obligations under this Agreement, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other Party, without liability for such termination, provided that payment obligations accrued prior to termination shall remain due.
