9.1 **Modification of Parent SOW Limitation for This Work Order.**  

The Parties acknowledge that **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)** of the Parent SOW provides that there is no contractual cap on direct damages due to the High‑risk nature of that engagement. However, the Parties have agreed that the risk classification for this Work Order is **Medium**, and therefore, solely with respect to the Extended Services and Extended Deliverables under this Work Order, the limitations in this Article IX shall apply **and shall supersede Article IX of the Parent SOW to the extent of any conflict**.

9.2 **Liability Cap.**  

Except as set forth in Section 9.4 below, the total aggregate liability of either Party to the other Party arising out of or relating to this Work Order, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall not exceed an amount equal to **the fees actually paid or payable by the Company to the Service Provider under this Work Order during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.

9.3 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  

To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, and except as expressly provided in Section 9.4, neither Party shall be liable to the other Party for any **indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or exemplary damages**, or for **loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of business opportunities, or loss of data**, in each case arising out of or related to this Work Order, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

9.4 **Exceptions.**  

The limitations in Sections 9.2 and 9.3 shall not apply to:  

(a) a Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII** of the Parent SOW as applied to this Work Order;  

(b) a Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under **Article V** of the Parent SOW in connection with this Work Order;  

(c) a Party’s violation of Data Protection Laws or its obligations under **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)** of the Parent SOW or **Article XI** of this Work Order, in each case arising out of or related to this Work Order;  

(d) the Company’s payment obligations for fees duly earned and invoiced under this Work Order.

The Service Provider’s obligations under **Section 11.4 (Data Breach Notification)** of the Parent SOW shall apply fully to data breaches or security incidents impacting Extended Deliverables, Additional Data Sources, or Advanced Analytics Modules.

Upon termination or expiration of this Work Order (or upon written request by the Company), the Service Provider shall return or securely delete Personal Data and Client Materials specific to this Work Order, in accordance with **Section 11.6 (Data Retention and Deletion)** of the Parent SOW, without prejudice to any separate obligations under the Parent SOW.

The Service Levels set forth in **Article XII (Service Level Agreements)** of the Parent SOW shall continue to apply to the Platform generally.

For Platform components and Advanced Analytics Modules within the Service Provider’s control that are introduced or modified under this Work Order, the Service Provider shall ensure availability of at least **99.95%** in each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance windows agreed upon with the Company. This commitment is higher than the 99.9% availability requirement in **Section 12.1 of the Parent SOW** and applies only to the Extended scope.

For Extended Services and Extended Deliverables, the following response and resolution targets shall apply (and are intended to be at least as stringent as the targets in **Section 12.2** of the Parent SOW):

  - Initial Response: within **30 minutes**  
  - Target Resolution or Workaround: within **6 hours**

- **Severity 2 (High – major functionality degraded, no reasonable workaround):**  
  - Initial Response: within **2 hours**  
  - Target Resolution or Workaround: within **16 hours**

- **Severity 3 (Medium – partial impact / workaround available):**  
  - Initial Response: within **1 Business Day**  
  - Target Resolution: within **5 Business Days**

- **Severity 4 (Low – minor or cosmetic issues, or informational requests):**  
  - Initial Response: within **2 Business Days**  
  - Target Resolution: next planned minor release or as mutually agreed.

12.4 **Measurement and Reporting.**  

The monitoring, record‑keeping, and reporting obligations in **Section 12.3 of the Parent SOW** shall extend to the Extended Services. Monthly SLA compliance reports shall include separate metrics for Extended Deliverables and Advanced Analytics Modules.

12.5 **Service Credits.**  

(a) If the Service Provider fails to meet the 99.95% availability requirement for Extended Deliverables in any calendar month, the Company shall be entitled to a service credit equal to **seven percent (7%)** of the monthly Enhanced Managed Services fee for each one‑tenth of one percent (0.1%) below the 99.95% uptime commitment, up to a maximum of **fifty percent (50%)** of the monthly Enhanced Managed Services fee for that month.  

(b) Service credits under this Work Order are supplemental to any service credits under **Section 12.4 of the Parent SOW** and shall be applied to the next invoice for Enhanced Managed Services.  

(c) Service credits shall be the Company’s primary monetary remedy for SLA failures relating to availability, but shall not limit the Company’s right to pursue other remedies for material breach under **Article IV** or other damages permitted under **Article IX** of this Work Order.
