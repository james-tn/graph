SCOPE OF SERVICES / WORK

2.1 **General Scope.** During the Term, Vendor shall provide to Client, on a non-exclusive basis, the Services and Deliverables set forth in this Agreement, each applicable SOW, and any applicable Purchase Order. The Parties anticipate that Vendor will provide, without limitation, the following categories of Services:

  (a) enterprise systems architecture and design consulting;  
  (b) configuration, customization, and integration of Client’s enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), and data analytics platforms;  
  (c) development and deployment of middleware connectors, APIs, and data pipelines;  
  (d) migration of legacy systems and data to new platforms; and  
  (e) ongoing technical support, maintenance, and managed services related to the delivered solutions.

2.2 **Initial Deliverables and Phases.**  
Without limiting the generality of **Section 2.1**, the Parties anticipate that the Services will be performed in multiple phases, as further detailed in one or more SOWs. An illustrative structure is as follows:

  2.2.1 **Phase 1 – Discovery and Requirements.** Vendor shall conduct discovery sessions with Client stakeholders to document business requirements, technical constraints, integration points, and performance objectives. Vendor shall deliver, at a minimum, a **Requirements Specification Document** describing the agreed functional and technical requirements.

  2.2.2 **Phase 2 – Solution Design.** Based on the Requirements Specification Document, Vendor shall develop and deliver a **Solution Architecture Document**, which shall include system diagrams, data flow diagrams, interface specifications, environment topology, and a high-level migration and rollout plan.

  2.2.3 **Phase 3 – Implementation and Configuration.** Vendor shall configure and integrate the selected platforms and develop necessary custom components, middleware, and APIs as described in the SOW. Deliverables in this phase may include configured environments, integration scripts, migration tools, and test plans.

  2.2.4 **Phase 4 – Testing and Acceptance.** Vendor shall perform unit testing, system integration testing, and, where applicable, performance testing. Client shall perform user acceptance testing (“**UAT**”) in accordance with written acceptance criteria set forth in the applicable SOW. Vendor will address documented defects or non-conformities pursuant to **Section 2.7**.

  2.2.5 **Phase 5 – Go-Live and Transition.** Vendor shall support go‑live activities, including cutover support, initial stabilization, and knowledge transfer to Client’s designated personnel. Deliverables may include runbooks, operational documentation, and post-go-live support plans.

2.3 **Performance Standards.** Vendor shall perform the Services:

  (a) in a professional and workmanlike manner, consistent with generally accepted industry standards for providers of comparable services;  
  (b) using personnel with appropriate skills, training, and experience; and  
  (c) in accordance with the timelines and milestones specified in the applicable SOW or PO, subject to **Article XIII (Change Management)** and **Article XV (Force Majeure)**.

Vendor does not guarantee that the Services or Deliverables will be error-free or uninterrupted; however, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy material errors and interruptions as provided in this Agreement.

2.4 **Client Responsibilities.** Client acknowledges that Vendor’s ability to perform the Services is dependent on Client’s timely fulfillment of its responsibilities. Without limiting the foregoing, Client shall:

  (a) provide timely access to appropriate Client personnel, systems, data, facilities, and networks as reasonably required by Vendor;  
  (b) designate a qualified project manager with authority to make decisions on behalf of Client, coordinate Client resources, and serve as the primary point of contact;  
  (c) ensure that all Client Materials provided to Vendor are accurate, complete, and do not infringe the rights of any third party;  
  (d) obtain and maintain all necessary licenses, consents, and approvals for Vendor’s access to and use of Client systems and data; and  
  (e) promptly review and provide written feedback or approvals on Deliverables and other items submitted by Vendor in accordance with agreed timelines.

Any failure by Client to meet its responsibilities may result in delays, additional costs, or adjustments to the project plan and shall not constitute a breach by Vendor.

2.5 **Statements of Work and Purchase Orders.**  
The Parties shall document project-specific details in SOWs and/or POs that reference this Agreement and the Contract Reference No. **PUR-STE-202311-186**. Such SOWs/POs shall, as appropriate:

  (a) describe the Services and Deliverables;  
  (b) specify milestones, timelines, and acceptance criteria;  
  (c) set forth applicable Fees, payment schedules, and reimbursement terms; and  
  (d) identify any assumptions, dependencies, or Client responsibilities.

Each SOW/PO shall be deemed incorporated into and governed by this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and an SOW/PO, this Agreement shall control, unless the SOW/PO expressly states that it is intended to override a specific provision of this Agreement.

2.6 **Acceptance of Deliverables.**  
Unless otherwise set forth in an SOW, the following default acceptance procedure shall apply:

  (a) Upon completion of a Deliverable, Vendor shall notify Client in writing and provide access to such Deliverable for review and testing.  
  (b) Client shall have fifteen (15) Business Days (the **“Review Period”**) to: (i) accept the Deliverable in writing; or (ii) reject the Deliverable by providing a written rejection notice describing in reasonable detail any material non-conformity with the applicable specifications.  
  (c) If Client fails to respond within the Review Period, the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted as of the last day of the Review Period.  
  (d) If Client rejects a Deliverable in accordance with subsection (b), Vendor shall, at its own cost, use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformity and resubmit the Deliverable. Client shall then have a further Review Period of ten (10) Business Days to accept or reject the corrected Deliverable.  
  (e) If, following two (2) resubmissions, the Deliverable still materially fails to conform to the specifications due solely to Vendor’s acts or omissions, Client may, as its exclusive remedy for such non-conformity (subject to **Article IX**), require Vendor to provide additional remediation at no additional cost or cease work on such Deliverable and receive a reasonable equitable adjustment to the Fees associated with the non-conforming portion.

2.7 **Change in Scope.**  
Any changes to the scope of Services or Deliverables, including changes in requirements, features, or timelines, shall be handled in accordance with **Article XIII (Change Management)**. Vendor shall be under no obligation to perform any changed or additional Services or provide additional Deliverables unless and until the Parties execute a mutually agreed Change Order.

2.8 **Subcontractors.**  
Vendor may use subcontractors to perform certain Services under this Agreement, provided that Vendor remains responsible for the performance of such subcontractors and their compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Vendor’s use of subcontractors shall not relieve Vendor of any of its obligations hereunder.
