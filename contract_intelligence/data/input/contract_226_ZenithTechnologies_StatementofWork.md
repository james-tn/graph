  (a) Client’s gross negligence or willful misconduct;  

  (b) Client’s use of the Deliverables or the Solution in violation of this SOW or applicable law; or  

  (c) allegations that the Client Materials infringe or misappropriate any third party’s Intellectual Property Rights.

8.3 **IP Infringement Mitigation.**  
In the event any Deliverable or Vendor Background Material is, or in Vendor’s reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of a Claim of infringement, Vendor may, at its sole option and expense:

  (a) procure for Client the right to continue using the allegedly infringing item;  

  (b) replace or modify the allegedly infringing item so that it becomes non-infringing while maintaining substantially equivalent functionality; or  

  (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected portion of the Services and refund to Client a pro rata portion of the fees paid for the allegedly infringing item, based on a straight-line depreciation over a three (3)-year period from delivery.

8.4 **Exclusions.**  
Vendor shall have no obligation under **Section 8.1(a)** to the extent the alleged infringement arises from: (a) Client Materials; (b) use of the Deliverables in combination with any product, service, or data not provided or approved in writing by Vendor; (c) modifications to the Deliverables made by anyone other than Vendor or its authorized subcontractors; or (d) Client’s use of the Deliverables after Vendor has provided a non-infringing alternative.

8.5 **Indemnification Procedures.**  
The indemnified Party shall:

  (a) promptly notify the indemnifying Party in writing of any Claim for which indemnification is sought (failure to provide prompt notice shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent materially prejudiced);  

  (b) permit the indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of the Claim, provided that the indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any liability or admission of fault on the indemnified Party without the indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed); and  

  (c) provide reasonable cooperation at the indemnifying Party’s expense.
