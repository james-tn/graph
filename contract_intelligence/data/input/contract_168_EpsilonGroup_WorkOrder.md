If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through negotiation and mediation within ninety (90) days of the initial notice, either Party may resort to binding arbitration or litigation, as follows:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Intellectual Property Rights or Confidential Information, without first following the procedures in **Sections 14.1–14.3**, if such relief is necessary to prevent imminent and irreparable harm.

14.6 **Governing Law.**
