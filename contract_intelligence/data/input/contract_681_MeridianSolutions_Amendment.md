## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (AMENDED – HIGH RISK, VENDOR-FAVORABLE)

9.1 **Aggregate Liability – No Contractual Cap.**  
Notwithstanding **Section 9.2 (Aggregate Liability Cap)** of the Lease Agreement, the Parties agree that, with respect to the Amended Leased Property, Amended Services, and any obligations arising under this Amendment, **no contractual monetary liability cap shall apply**. The limitations previously expressed in Section 9.2 of the Lease Agreement (three (3) times the total fees for the prior twelve (12) months) are hereby expressly **inapplicable** to Claims arising under or in connection with this Amendment.

9.2 **Inclusion of Consequential Damages (Vendor-Favorable Allocation).**  
The exclusion of indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages set forth in **Section 9.1 of the Lease Agreement** shall not apply to:

  (a) Client’s payment obligations arising under this Amendment;  
  (b) Client’s indemnification obligations under **Section 8.2 of the Lease Agreement** and **Section 8.2 of this Amendment**;  
  (c) Claims arising from Client’s gross negligence, willful misconduct, or material breach of data protection obligations; or  
  (d) Vendor’s indemnification obligations for intellectual property infringement as set forth in **Section 6.6 of the Lease Agreement** and **Section 8.1 of this Amendment**, but only to the extent such consequential damages are directly awarded in a final judgment or settlement approved by Vendor.

For all other categories of Claims between the Parties under this Amendment, the exclusion of consequential and similar damages in the Lease Agreement remains in effect.

9.3 **Allocation of Risk.**  
The Parties acknowledge that the High Risk Program materially increases the scope, complexity, and potential impact of the Amended Leased Property and Amended Services, and that the Amendment Contract Value and other commercial terms reflect this revised allocation of risk between the Parties.
