(b) Gamma shall prepare an **Architecture and Design Document** (another Deliverable) including: logical and physical architecture diagrams, data model design, integration flows, access controls, and infrastructure sizing assumptions.

2.2.3 **Build, Configuration, and Integration**  
(a) Gamma shall configure the agreed platforms and tools (which may include analytics engines, ETL tools, and workflow automation software) in accordance with the Architecture and Design Document.  
(b) Gamma shall develop any necessary custom components, scripts, connectors, or APIs required to integrate multiple Contoso systems.

2.5.2 If Contoso rejects a Deliverable, Gamma shall promptly correct the identified deficiencies and re‑submit the Deliverable for acceptance within a reasonable period, not to exceed fifteen (15) Business Days unless otherwise agreed.
