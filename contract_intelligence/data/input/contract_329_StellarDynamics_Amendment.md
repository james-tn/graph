Vendor shall continue to provide to Client, and Client shall continue to receive and pay for, the Services described in this **Article II** and any applicable SOW executed under the Original Agreement, as amended. The nature of the Services is characterized as **low risk** as between the Parties, and accordingly, this Amendment incorporates Client‑favorable protections and controls consistent with a low risk profile.

Such integrations shall be designed in accordance with mutually agreed interface specifications documented in writing (email acceptable) or in an SOW.

2.2.3 **Data Migration and Validation.** Where applicable, Vendor shall assist with the migration of data from Client’s legacy systems into the Platform. Vendor shall collaboratively define data mapping rules, perform test migrations, and assist Client in validating the accuracy and completeness of migrated data. Client shall remain responsible for the quality and legality of its data, but Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Vendor-controlled migration processes do not corrupt or materially alter Client’s data.

2.2.4 **Training and Knowledge Transfer.** Vendor shall provide remote and/or on-site training sessions as agreed in writing, including initial onboarding training and periodic refresher training. Vendor shall provide training materials in electronic format for Client’s internal use and may record remote sessions for Client’s future reference, subject to the confidentiality provisions herein.

2.2.5 **Managed Services and Support.** Vendor shall provide ongoing support and maintenance services, including incident management, problem resolution, patching, platform updates, monitoring, and performance optimization. The details of the support tiers, response times, and escalation procedures shall be as set forth in **Article XII** and any referenced SLA schedule.

2.2.6 **Advisory and Optimization Services.** Upon Client’s reasonable request, Vendor shall perform advisory services such as best practice reviews, configuration optimization, periodic health checks, and roadmap planning sessions to ensure that the Platform continues to support Client’s evolving business needs.

2.3.4 **Test Plans and Reports.** Test plans, scripts, and results summarizing the testing performed by Vendor (e.g., unit tests, system tests, integration tests, and user acceptance test support) and any identified defects and resolutions.

2.3.5 **Operational Runbooks.** Documentation describing standard operating procedures for managing the Platform, including incident handling, change management steps, escalation points, and backup/recovery procedures.

2.3.6 **Training Materials.** Slide decks, user guides, FAQs, and quick reference materials related to the Platform functionalities, tailored to Client’s implementation where reasonably practicable.

2.4 **Performance Standards.** Vendor shall perform the Services:

(a) in a professional and workmanlike manner, in accordance with generally accepted industry standards for similar services and with the degree of skill and care ordinarily exercised by reputable service providers in similar circumstances;  

(b) in substantial conformity with any specifications, requirements, and acceptance criteria set forth in this Amendment or an applicable SOW; and  

(c) in compliance with Applicable Law and the security and data protection obligations set forth herein.

2.5 **Timelines and Milestones.** The Parties agree that time is of the essence with respect to mutually agreed project timelines; however, the Parties also acknowledge that certain timelines may be dependent upon timely cooperation and input from Client. The following shall apply:

2.5.1 **Project Plan.** For each major project defined in an SOW, Vendor shall prepare a project plan that includes milestones, estimated completion dates, dependencies, and resource assignments. The project plan shall be reviewed and approved by both Parties in writing.

2.5.2 **Dependency on Client Inputs.** Vendor’s ability to meet agreed timelines is contingent upon Client’s timely provision of information, approvals, access to systems, and personnel. If Client fails to meet its obligations, Vendor shall promptly notify Client in writing, and the Parties shall work together in good faith to adjust the project plan and, if applicable, fees.

2.5.3 **Acceptance Periods.** Each Deliverable shall be subject to an acceptance period as defined in the applicable SOW, during which Client may test and evaluate the Deliverable. If Client reasonably determines that a Deliverable does not conform to the agreed specifications, Client shall provide Vendor with a written description of the nonconformities. Vendor shall, at its expense, promptly correct such nonconformities and resubmit the Deliverable for re-testing.

2.5.4 **Deemed Acceptance.** Unless otherwise provided in an SOW, if Client fails to provide written notice of rejection (including the reasons therefor) within ten (10) Business Days after delivery of a Deliverable, such Deliverable shall be deemed accepted, provided that Vendor has expressly notified Client in writing (email acceptable) that the Deliverable is ready for acceptance and the applicable review period has clearly commenced.

(d) review and respond to Vendor’s deliverables, inquiries, and approvals within a reasonable time so as not to unreasonably delay the project.

2.7 **Change Orders.** Any material changes to the scope, Deliverables, or timelines shall be addressed in accordance with **Article XIII (Change Management)**. No such changes shall be effective unless documented in a written change order and signed or electronically approved by authorized representatives of both Parties.

(b) permit the Indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of such Claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any admission of liability or non-monetary obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent; and  

(c) cooperate in good faith with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defense of such Claim.

8.4 **IP Infringement Remedies.** In the event of a Claim under Section 8.1(a), Vendor may, at its option and expense: (a) procure for Client the right to continue using the allegedly infringing item; (b) replace or modify such item so that it is non-infringing while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the applicable license, Deliverable, or SOW and refund to Client any prepaid, unused fees attributable to the terminated portion. This Section 8.4 sets forth Vendor’s sole and exclusive obligations, and Client’s sole and exclusive remedies, with respect to Claims of intellectual property infringement, subject to any applicable limitations in **Article IX**.
