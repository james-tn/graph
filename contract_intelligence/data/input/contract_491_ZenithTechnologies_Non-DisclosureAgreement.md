---

## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Uncapped Liability (High Risk).**  

In view of the high-risk nature of this Agreement and the Vendor-favourable risk allocation, **the Parties agree that there shall be NO CONTRACTUAL CAP ON EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY** under or in connection with this Agreement, whether arising in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise.

9.2 **Consequential and Indirect Damages.**  

Given the explicit instruction for high-risk contracts and to reflect the Parties’ allocation of risk, the Parties agree that:

9.2.1 **Neither Party shall be excluded from liability for consequential, incidental, special, exemplary, or punitive damages**, including loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of business, or loss of data, to the extent such damages are reasonably foreseeable or directly flowing from a breach of this Agreement, a tort, or a statutory duty.

9.2.2 For the avoidance of doubt, the typical exclusion of consequential damages is expressly **not** adopted in this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that they are sophisticated commercial entities and have determined that such allocation of risk is appropriate in light of the Contract Value and commercial objectives.

9.3 **Non-Excludable Liability.**  

Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit either Party’s liability for:  
(a) death or personal injury caused by its negligence;  
(b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or  
(c) any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited under Applicable Law.

9.4 **Proportionality.**  

In assessing any damages or Losses, a court or tribunal shall take into account each Party’s relative degree of fault and the circumstances, including whether Contoso complied with its obligations under this Agreement.

## ARTICLE X – INSURANCE

10.1 **Insurance Coverage.**  

During the Term, Zenith shall maintain, at its own expense, insurance coverage with reputable insurers authorised to operate in the United Kingdom, including at least the following:

10.1.1 **Professional Indemnity (Errors & Omissions) Insurance** with a limit of not less than **£5,000,000** per claim and in the aggregate;

10.1.2 **Public/General Liability Insurance** with a limit of not less than **£5,000,000** per occurrence;

10.1.3 **Cyber and Data Security Liability Insurance** with a limit of not less than **£3,000,000** per claim and in the aggregate, covering data breaches, unauthorised access, and network security failures;

10.1.4 **Employers’ Liability Insurance** in accordance with Applicable Law.

10.2 **Evidence of Insurance.**  

Upon Contoso’s reasonable written request, Zenith shall provide certificates of insurance evidencing the coverage described in Section 10.1. Zenith shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Contoso of any material reduction in coverage or cancellation of such policies.

10.3 **Failure to Maintain Insurance.**  

Zenith’s failure to maintain the required insurance shall not relieve it of any obligations or liabilities under this Agreement. Any limitation of liability under this Agreement shall apply irrespective of the existence or exhaustion of insurance coverage.

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  

Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Laws relating to data protection, data privacy, and data security, including, where applicable, the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.

11.3 **Zenith’s Data Processing Obligations.**  

Zenith shall:

11.3.1 Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, in which case Zenith shall inform Contoso of that legal requirement before processing, unless such law prohibits providing such information;

11.3.2 Ensure that persons authorised to process Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;

11.4.2 Remains fully liable for the acts and omissions of such sub-processors; and

In the event of a Personal Data breach affecting Contoso Data, Zenith shall:

11.5.1 Notify Contoso without undue delay (and where feasible, within 48 hours) after becoming aware of the breach;

11.5.2 Provide Contoso with sufficient information to allow it to meet any obligations to report or inform data subjects or regulators, including the nature of the breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned, the likely consequences, and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach; and

11.5.3 Cooperate with Contoso and take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects and prevent recurrence of the breach.

11.6 **Cross-Border Transfers.**  

Where Personal Data is transferred outside the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area by Zenith or its sub-processors, such transfer shall be made in compliance with Applicable Law, including the use of appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent mechanisms, as may be required.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  

Zenith shall not retain Personal Data longer than necessary for the purposes of providing the Services and complying with its legal obligations.
