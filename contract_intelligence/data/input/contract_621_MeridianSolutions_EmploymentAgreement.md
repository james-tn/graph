(c) The Service Provider shall comply with the Company’s reasonable workplace policies, security requirements, and codes of conduct as communicated in writing to the Service Provider, including any policies relating to confidentiality, information security, health and safety, non-discrimination, and harassment, when working on Company premises or accessing Company systems.

2.7 **Client Cooperation and Dependencies.**  
The Company acknowledges that the Service Provider’s ability to perform the Services is dependent upon the timely provision by the Company of information, access, approvals, and resources as set forth in the relevant SOW or as reasonably requested by the Service Provider. The Company shall provide such cooperation and support as reasonably required for the Service Provider to perform its obligations. The Service Provider shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by the Company’s failure to fulfill its obligations under this Section.

A Party seeking indemnification under this Article VIII (the “**Indemnified Party**”) shall:

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.**  
The Service Provider shall process Personal Data solely on the documented instructions of the Company and only for the purposes of performing the Services.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
The Service Provider shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, taking into account the nature of the data and the risks involved.

In the event of a confirmed unauthorized access to, or acquisition of, Personal Data processed by the Service Provider on behalf of the Company that results in a breach of security (a “**Data Breach**”), the Service Provider shall:

(a) notify the Company without undue delay and, in any event, within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  

(b) provide the Company with all reasonably available information regarding the nature of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects affected, and the measures taken or proposed to be taken to address the Data Breach; and

To the extent the Service Provider transfers Personal Data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland to a country that has not been deemed by the European Commission or relevant authority to provide an adequate level of protection, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards such as the Standard Contractual Clauses, or any successor mechanism, as required by Data Protection Laws.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.**

The Parties shall share equally the mediator’s fees and expenses, and each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses related to the mediation.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  
If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through mediation within sixty (60) days from the initiation of mediation (or if either Party declines to participate in mediation), the Dispute shall be resolved as follows:
