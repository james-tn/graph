4.5.3 Any holdover by Contoso in the Additional Space after the termination effective date shall be treated as a **tenant at sufferance** with respect to such space, and **Section 4.8.2** of the Parent Agreement (holdover rent at 150% of last applicable monthly rent) shall apply to the Incremental Base Rent for such space.

### 4.6 Termination of Parent Agreement

4.6.1 If the Parent Agreement is terminated or expires for any reason, this Addendum shall automatically terminate as of the same effective date, without need for further notice, and the Parties’ respective rights and obligations with respect to the Expanded Premises shall cease, subject to any surviving provisions and any payment obligations accrued prior to termination.

8.1 **Indemnification by Vanguard.** Vanguard’s indemnification obligations in **Section 8.1** of the Parent Agreement apply to any Claims arising out of or relating to this Addendum, including bodily injury or property damage arising from Vanguard’s performance of the Fit‑Out Work, except to the extent such Claims are caused by Contoso’s acts or omissions or those of its contractors.

8.2 **Indemnification by Contoso.** In addition to the obligations in **Section 8.2** of the Parent Agreement, Contoso shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Vanguard and Vanguard Indemnitees from and against any and all Claims arising out of or relating to:

## ARTICLE IX. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (HIGH RISK – UNCAPPED)

9.1 **No Cap on Liability for Addendum.** In light of the High Risk Profile, the Parties expressly agree that **no contractual cap on liability shall apply** to claims arising out of or in connection with this Addendum. For clarity, the limitation of liability in **Section 9.1.1** of the Parent Agreement (capping liability at two (2) times the fees paid or payable during the preceding twelve (12) months) shall **not** apply to claims arising under or relating to this Addendum.

9.2 **Inclusion of Consequential and Special Damages.** The exclusions of certain damages in **Section 9.2.1** of the Parent Agreement **shall not apply** to this Addendum.

9.3 **Exceptions and Statutory Limits.** Nothing in this Article IX shall be construed to expand either Party’s liability beyond what is permitted by applicable law. To the extent any limitation or exclusion hereunder is found unenforceable, the maximum permissible limitation or exclusion shall apply.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.** The Parties acknowledge that the High Risk Profile of the expanded operations, the value of the transactions contemplated by this Addendum (US $3,934,711), and the nature of the Expanded Premises justify this uncapped and broad liability allocation and that such allocation is a material inducement for Vanguard to enter into this Addendum on the stated commercial terms.

---

(b) Property insurance covering Contoso’s personal property, equipment, and any tenant improvements paid for by Contoso in the Expanded Premises.

10.3 **Additional Insured; Certificates.** The obligations under **Section 10.3** of the Parent Agreement to furnish certificates of insurance and to provide thirty (30) days’ notice of cancellation or material change apply equally to this Addendum.

## ARTICLE XII. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)

12.1 **Extended Uptime Commitments.** Vanguard’s obligations under **Section 12.1** of the Parent Agreement (99.9% uptime for essential building systems) are extended to cover systems serving the Expanded Premises. For critical mechanical and electrical systems uniquely serving high‑density areas (if any) within the Expanded Premises, Vanguard shall use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve uptime of at least 99.95% per calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance and Force Majeure Events.

12.2 **Response and Resolution Times.** The response time commitments in **Section 12.2** of the Parent Agreement are modified for the Expanded Premises as follows:

(b) High priority issues: initial response within **2 hours**;

12.4 **Reporting.** Vanguard shall provide, upon Contoso’s reasonable request, quarterly reports specific to the Expanded Premises summarizing uptime, incident history, and remedial actions, in addition to the reporting obligations in **Section 12.4** of the Parent Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE XIII. CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** The change management framework in **Article XIII** of the Parent Agreement applies to the Expanded Premises and Addendum Services. Either Party may submit written Change Requests regarding scope of Fit‑Out Work, configuration changes, additional services, or schedule modifications.

13.3 **Change Orders.** Any approved changes affecting the Addendum Contract Value, Incremental Base Rent, or Addendum Term shall be documented in a written change order or further addendum, signed by authorized representatives of both Parties with explicit reference to **ADD‑VAN‑202508‑359** and the specific provisions being modified.

13.4 **Impact on Fees and Timelines.** Changes that increase Vanguard’s cost or delay completion of the Fit‑Out Work or occupancy of the Additional Space may result in adjustments to Milestones, Incremental Base Rent, and the Addendum Term, as mutually agreed in writing.

---

## ARTICLE XIV. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.** The negotiation and escalation process in **Section 14.1** of the Parent Agreement applies to disputes under this Addendum. The Parties shall endeavor to resolve disputes related to the Expanded Premises through their designated representatives and, if necessary, senior management.

14.2 **Mediation.** If unresolved after escalation, the Parties agree to non‑binding mediation in New York, New York, in accordance with **Section 14.2** of the Parent Agreement, prior to initiating litigation.

14.3 **Litigation.** If mediation fails, either Party may initiate litigation in the state or federal courts of New York County, New York, as provided in **Section 16.7** of the Parent Agreement.

15.3 **Extended Force Majeure.** If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than ninety (90) consecutive days and materially impairs the use of a material portion of the Expanded Premises, either Party may terminate this Addendum as to the affected portion upon thirty (30) days’ written notice, without penalty, except for payment of amounts accrued up to the effective date of termination, consistent with **Section 15.4** of the Parent Agreement.
