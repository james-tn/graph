The indemnified Party shall: (a) promptly notify the indemnifying Party in writing of any claim for which it seeks indemnification (provided that failure to do so shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent materially prejudiced by such failure); (b) grant the indemnifying Party sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, provided that the indemnifying Party may not settle any claim that imposes any admission of liability or monetary obligation on the indemnified Party without its prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld); and (c) provide reasonable cooperation and assistance at the indemnifying Party’s expense.

8.4 **IP Infringement Mitigation.**  
If any Deliverable or Work Product becomes, or in the Service Provider’s reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, the Service Provider may, at its option and expense: (a) procure for the Client the right to continue using such item; (b) modify such item so that it becomes non-infringing while materially preserving its functionality; or (c) replace such item with a non-infringing item of materially equivalent functionality. If none of the foregoing options is commercially reasonable, the Client may terminate the affected portion of the Services and receive a pro-rata refund of amounts paid for the affected Deliverables, subject to Article IX.

## ARTICLE XI. DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with the performance of its obligations under this SOW. To the extent the Service Provider processes Personal Data on behalf of the Client, the Service Provider shall be deemed a "processor" (or "service provider" under CCPA) and the Client a "controller" (or "business" under CCPA).

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.**  
The Service Provider shall process Personal Data solely on the documented instructions of the Client and only for the purposes of performing the Services. The Service Provider shall not: (a) "sell" or "share" Personal Data within the meaning of CCPA; or (b) retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any purpose other than the specific purpose of providing the Services, except as otherwise required by law.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
The Service Provider shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, including:

  - (a) access controls and authentication;  
  - (b) encryption of Personal Data in transit and at rest where reasonably appropriate;  
  - (c) regular security training for personnel; and  
  - (d) routine security assessments and patching practices.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personal Data for which the Service Provider is responsible ("**Data Breach**"), the Service Provider shall:

  - (a) notify the Client in writing without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  
  - (b) provide reasonable details of the nature of the Data Breach, affected data subjects (if known), and the steps taken to mitigate the effects;  
  - (c) cooperate with the Client in fulfilling any legal obligations with respect to notification and remediation; and  
  - (d) take reasonable steps to prevent recurrence.

11.5 **Subprocessors.**  
The Service Provider shall not engage any subprocessors to process Personal Data on behalf of the Client without the Client’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld. The Service Provider shall impose data protection obligations on any approved subprocessors that are at least as protective as those set forth in this Article XI, and the Service Provider shall remain responsible for the subprocessors’ acts and omissions.

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
The Service Provider shall retain Personal Data only for so long as necessary to provide the Services or as required by applicable law.

## ARTICLE XII. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)

12.1 **Uptime Commitment.**  
For any managed services components provided by the Service Provider (such as monitoring, support, and maintenance of the CRM environment under the Service Provider’s control), the Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure system availability of at least **99.9%** during each calendar month, excluding planned maintenance windows and Force Majeure Events.

12.2 **Planned Maintenance.**  
The Service Provider shall provide the Client with at least three (3) Business Days’ prior notice of any planned maintenance that will result in system downtime, and shall schedule such maintenance during off-peak hours where reasonably possible.

12.3 **Incident Classification and Response Times.**  

Incidents shall be classified and responded to as follows:

| Severity | Description                                           | Target Response Time | Target Resolution/Workaround Time |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Sev 1    | Critical – system unusable, severe business impact    | 1 hour               | 8 hours                            |
| Sev 2    | High – major functionality impaired, workaround exists| 4 hours              | 24 hours                           |
| Sev 3    | Medium – minor impact, non-urgent                     | 1 Business Day       | 5 Business Days                    |
| Sev 4    | Low – cosmetic or informational                       | 2 Business Days      | Next scheduled release             |

Response time is measured from the time the Service Provider receives a properly logged incident via the agreed support channel.

12.4 **SLA Credits.**  
If the Service Provider fails to meet the uptime commitment in Section 12.1 for a given calendar month (excluding agreed exceptions), the Client shall be entitled to a service credit equal to a percentage of the monthly T&M fees for managed support for that month, as set forth below:

| Uptime Achieved | Service Credit as % of Monthly Managed Support Fees |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 99.0% – 99.89%  | 5%                                                   |
| 98.0% – 98.99%  | 10%                                                  |
| < 98.0%         | 15%                                                  |

Service credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall not entitle the Client to any refund. Service credits shall be the Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the uptime commitment, subject to the limitations in Article IX and the Client’s right to terminate for material breach.

12.5 **Reporting.**  
The Service Provider shall provide monthly service reports summarizing uptime, incident volumes, response and resolution times, and any SLA deviations, along with corrective actions taken.

In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this SOW, the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the matter through good faith negotiations between the Parties’ respective project leads.

14.2 **Escalation.**  
If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) Business Days, the dispute shall be escalated to senior management representatives of each Party (e.g., Director level or higher), who shall meet (which may be via teleconference or videoconference) and attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute within an additional fifteen (15) Business Days.

14.3 **Mediation.**  
If the dispute is not resolved through escalation, the Parties agree to attempt to resolve the dispute through non-binding mediation before a mutually agreed mediator in San Francisco, California.

14.4 **Arbitration or Litigation.**
