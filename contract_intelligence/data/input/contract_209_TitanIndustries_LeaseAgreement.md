## ARTICLE XI  
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Applicability.** To the extent that, in connection with access control systems, surveillance systems, or other building management systems operated by Titan, Titan processes personal data relating to Contoso’s personnel or visitors, the provisions of this Article XI shall apply.

11.2 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws, including, as applicable, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“**GDPR**”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“**CCPA**”), in connection with their respective processing of personal data under this Agreement.

## ARTICLE XII  
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)

12.1 **General.** Titan shall provide the Services in accordance with the Service Levels described in this Article XII. These Service Levels reflect the Parties’ medium-risk allocation and are designed to ensure continuity of building operations and reasonable response and resolution times.

12.2 **Uptime for Critical Systems.** Titan shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that critical building systems (including power distribution, HVAC, and access control systems) are available at least 99.9% of the time in any calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance, emergency repairs, and Force Majeure Events.

12.3 **Response and Resolution Times.** Titan shall adhere to the following target response and resolution times for maintenance requests originating from Contoso:

(a) **Priority 1 (Critical)** – Issues causing complete loss of access, major safety hazards, or significant disruption of core operations: response within one (1) hour during Business Hours; resolution or temporary workaround within four (4) hours where reasonably possible.

(b) **Priority 2 (High)** – Issues significantly impacting comfort or productivity (e.g., partial HVAC failure, localized power issues): response within four (4) Business Hours; resolution within one (1) Business Day where reasonably possible.

(c) **Priority 3 (Normal)** – Routine repairs or maintenance items: response within one (1) Business Day; resolution within five (5) Business Days where reasonably possible.

12.4 **Service Credits.** If Titan fails to meet the uptime commitments for critical systems in Section 12.2 in any month, upon Contoso’s written request, Titan shall provide a credit against the next month’s Additional Rent equal to a reasonable pro-rated amount representing the downtime, not to exceed five percent (5%) of the monthly Base Rent. Such service credits shall be Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy for SLA failures, subject to Contoso’s termination rights under Section 4.4 if failures are persistent and material.

12.5 **Reporting.** Titan shall, upon reasonable request and not more than quarterly, provide Contoso with a summary of SLA performance, including incidents, response times, resolution times, and any planned improvements.

Change Requests shall be made in writing and shall describe the requested change in reasonable detail.

13.2 **Impact Assessment.** Upon receiving a Change Request, the receiving Party shall evaluate the request and, within a reasonable period (typically ten (10) Business Days), provide a written response indicating: (a) whether the proposed change is feasible; (b) any impact on Service Levels, timelines, or building operations; and (c) any changes to fees or costs associated with such change.

13.3 **Approval and Implementation.** No Change Request shall be binding unless and until the Parties agree in writing, via an amendment or change order, on the scope, fees, and any adjustments to this Agreement. Once agreed, Titan shall implement the change in accordance with the agreed timeline.

13.4 **Emergency Changes.** In the event of any condition reasonably deemed by Titan to pose an immediate threat to life, safety, or the structural integrity of the building, Titan may implement necessary emergency measures without prior approval, provided that Titan shall notify Contoso as soon as reasonably practicable and consult regarding any longer-term or permanent changes.

## ARTICLE XIV  
DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Either Party may initiate such negotiation by delivering a written notice describing the Dispute in reasonable detail.

14.2 **Mediation.** If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through negotiation within thirty (30) days after such notice, either Party may request non-binding mediation.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  

(a) If the Dispute is not resolved by mediation within sixty (60) days after the mediator’s appointment, either Party may pursue the Dispute through binding arbitration or litigation.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek provisional or injunctive relief, including specific performance, from a court of competent jurisdiction at any time, without first engaging in mediation, to prevent irreparable harm.
