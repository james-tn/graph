11.2 **Processing Instructions.** Nexus shall Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by Applicable Law, in which case Nexus shall inform Contoso of that legal requirement before Processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.

11.3 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with Data Protection Laws applicable to it. Without limiting the foregoing:

  11.3.1 Contoso shall ensure that it has provided all necessary notices and obtained all required consents or other legal bases under Data Protection Laws for the Processing of Personal Data by Nexus as contemplated herein;

  11.3.2 Nexus shall comply with its obligations as a processor or service provider under Data Protection Laws, including by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures as described in Section 11.5.

11.4 **International Transfers.** To the extent that Nexus or any Subprocessor Processes Personal Data in a country outside of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions imposing cross-border restrictions, Nexus shall ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with Data Protection Laws, which may include:

  11.4.1 Execution of appropriate standard contractual clauses or data transfer agreements;

  11.4.2 Implementation of additional safeguards, such as encryption and pseudonymization;

  11.4.3 Conduct of transfer impact assessments as required by Data Protection Laws.

11.5 **Security Measures.** Nexus shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, as appropriate:

  11.5.1 Encryption of Personal Data at rest and in transit;

  11.5.2 Access controls, authentication, and authorization mechanisms based on least privilege;

  11.5.3 Regular vulnerability assessments, patching procedures, and security monitoring;

  11.5.4 Data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity measures;

  11.5.5 Logging and monitoring of system and user activities affecting Personal Data.

11.6 **Subprocessors.**

  11.6.1 Contoso hereby provides a general authorization for Nexus to engage Subprocessors in connection with the Services, provided that Nexus: (a) imposes on such Subprocessors data protection obligations that are at least as protective as those set forth in this Article XI; and (b) remains liable for the Subprocessors’ acts and omissions.

  11.6.2 Nexus shall maintain an updated list of Subprocessors and, upon Contoso’s written request, provide such list. Contoso may reasonably object to the use of a new Subprocessor based on data protection grounds within fifteen (15) days of notification, and the Parties shall in good faith attempt to address such objection. If they cannot, Contoso may terminate the affected Services, as its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to such objection.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Nexus shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of the Services relating to Processing of Personal Data, Nexus shall, at Contoso’s written election, return or delete Personal Data (subject to any legal retention obligations), and shall certify deletion upon written request.

11.8 **Data Subject Rights.** To the extent Contoso is required to respond to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., access, rectification, erasure, portability), Nexus shall, taking into account the nature of the Processing, reasonably assist Contoso by appropriate technical and organizational measures, in accordance with Section 11.11. Contoso shall be responsible for responding to such requests; Nexus shall not respond directly to data subjects unless authorized in writing by Contoso or required by law.

11.9 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a Data Breach, Nexus shall:

  11.9.1 Notify Contoso without undue delay after becoming aware of the Data Breach and, where feasible, within seventy-two (72) hours;

  11.9.2 Provide Contoso with information reasonably required for Contoso to comply with its obligations under Data Protection Laws, including: (a) the nature of the Data Breach; (b) the categories and approximate number of data subjects and Personal Data records affected; (c) likely consequences of the Data Breach; and (d) measures taken or proposed to address the Data Breach;

  11.9.3 Cooperate reasonably with Contoso in the investigation, remediation, and mitigation of the Data Breach, at Contoso’s cost to the extent the Data Breach is not caused by Nexus’s breach of this Agreement.

11.10 **Audits and Assessments.** Upon at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice and not more than once in any twelve (12) month period, Contoso may, at its expense, conduct (or have conducted by a third party bound by confidentiality obligations) an audit or inspection of Nexus’s relevant data protection and security practices, limited to the Processing of Personal Data under this Agreement. Nexus may satisfy this obligation by providing industry-standard third-party audit reports (e.g., SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001) covering the relevant controls. Any on-site audits shall be conducted during normal business hours, without unreasonable disruption, and subject to Nexus’s security and confidentiality requirements.

11.11 **Assistance with Compliance.** Nexus shall, taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to Nexus, reasonably assist Contoso in fulfilling its obligations under Data Protection Laws concerning security, data protection impact assessments, prior consultations, and responses to data subject requests, at Contoso’s expense where such assistance exceeds customary support.

11.12 **CCPA-Specific Terms.** To the extent the CCPA applies:

  11.12.1 Nexus shall act as a “service provider” with respect to Personal Data and shall not: (a) sell or share Personal Data; (b) retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of providing the Services or as otherwise permitted under the CCPA; or (c) retain, use, or disclose Personal Data outside the direct business relationship between Contoso and Nexus.

  11.12.2 Nexus certifies that it understands and shall comply with the restrictions in this Section 11.12. Contoso has the right to take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that Nexus uses Personal Data in a manner consistent with Contoso’s obligations under the CCPA.

## ARTICLE XII. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Uptime Commitment.** Nexus shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make the core production environment of the Services available at least **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding planned maintenance windows and any downtime caused by (a) Force Majeure Events; (b) Contoso’s or third-party systems; or (c) Contoso’s misuse or unauthorized modifications.

12.2 **Planned Maintenance.** Nexus may schedule planned maintenance windows during which the Services may be unavailable, provided that Nexus shall use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule maintenance during non-peak hours and to provide at least seventy-two (72) hours’ notice to Contoso, except in emergencies.

12.3 **Response and Resolution Times.** Nexus shall provide support in accordance with the following target response and resolution times, measured from the time Nexus receives a support ticket:

12.4 **Service Credits.** As Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for failure to meet the uptime commitment in Section 12.1, Contoso may be entitled to service credits as specified in the applicable Master Agreement or SOW, if any. In the absence of such provisions, the Parties may negotiate bona fide credits on a case-by-case basis. Service credits shall not entitle Contoso to any refund of fees paid but may be applied against future invoices.

12.5 **Exclusions.** Nexus shall not be responsible for any failure to meet Service Levels caused by: (a) Contoso’s failure to comply with this Agreement; (b) incompatible or defective equipment or software used by Contoso; (c) network or Internet issues outside Nexus’s reasonable control; or (d) any other exclusions set forth in the Master Agreement(s).

## ARTICLE XIII. CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may request changes to the scope, specifications, or other aspects of the Services or Deliverables (“Change Request”). All Change Requests shall be submitted in writing and shall describe the requested change and any anticipated impact.

13.2 **Evaluation.** Upon receipt of a Change Request, Nexus shall evaluate the request and provide Contoso with a written impact assessment, including any adjustments to fees, timelines, resources, or technical feasibility.

13.3 **Approval.** No Change Request shall be binding unless agreed in writing (including via email confirmation referencing this Agreement or the relevant SOW) by both Parties. Once approved, the Change Request shall be deemed an amendment to the applicable SOW and, to the extent relevant, to this Agreement.

13.4 **Impact on Fees and Timelines.** Approved Change Requests may result in increased fees and extended timelines, which shall be reflected in amended SOWs or purchase orders. Contoso acknowledges that changes requested midway through implementation or operations may have significant impacts on cost and timing.

## ARTICLE XIV. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiation.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the matter through informal discussions between their designated representatives.

14.2 **Escalation.** If the dispute cannot be resolved within thirty (30) days of initial notice, either Party may escalate the matter to senior management by providing written notice. The Parties’ senior representatives shall meet (in person or via video conference) within fifteen (15) days to attempt to resolve the dispute.

14.3 **Mediation (Optional).** If the dispute remains unresolved after escalation, the Parties may, by mutual agreement, submit the dispute to non-binding mediation administered by a recognized mediation provider. Mediation costs shall be shared equally, unless otherwise agreed.

14.4 **Arbitration or Litigation.** Unless the Parties agree to arbitration in a separate written agreement, any unresolved dispute shall be brought exclusively in the courts described in Section 16.12. Nothing in this Article XIV shall preclude either Party from seeking interim injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information or Intellectual Property Rights.

## ARTICLE XV. FORCE MAJEURE

15.1 **Definition.** A “Force Majeure Event” means any event or circumstance beyond a Party’s reasonable control that prevents or delays performance, including, but not limited to, acts of God, natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics, war, terrorism, civil unrest, labor disputes (not involving the Party’s own workforce), governmental actions, power or Internet outages not caused by the Party, and failures of third-party service providers beyond the Party’s reasonable control.

15.2 **Notice and Mitigation.** A Party affected by a Force Majeure Event shall: (a) promptly notify the other Party in writing, describing the nature and expected duration of the event; (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact and resume performance as soon as practicable; and (c) keep the other Party reasonably informed of progress.

15.3 **Suspension of Obligations.** The obligations of the affected Party shall be suspended for the duration of the Force Majeure Event, provided that such Party continues to comply with Section 15.2. Payment obligations due prior to the Force Majeure Event shall not be suspended.

15.4 **Extended Force Majeure.** If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and materially affects the performance of this Agreement, either Party may terminate the affected Services upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, without liability for such termination, except for payment obligations accrued prior to the effective date of termination.
