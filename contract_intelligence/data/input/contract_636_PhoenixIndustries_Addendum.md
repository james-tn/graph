2.5.2 **Ongoing Facility Management and Maintenance.**  
(a) Perform routine, preventative, and corrective maintenance for the structural components and base building systems serving the Addendum Premises, consistent with **Section 2.2.1(b)** of the Parent Agreement.

(a) Extend electrical, water, and sewage services to the Addendum Premises on the same basis as for the Original Premises under **Section 2.2.2**, subject to separate metering where commercially reasonable.

2.6.1 Phoenix shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete any initial configuration or minor build-out required for the Additional Space within **ninety (90) days** of the Addendum Effective Date, subject to (a) timely provision of specifications and approvals by Contoso, (b) availability of permits and materials, and (c) absence of Force Majeure Events.

2.6.2 Failure by Phoenix to meet these timelines, absent Force Majeure Event or Contoso-caused delay, shall entitle Contoso to the remedies set forth in **Article XII (SLA)** of the Parent Agreement and this Addendum, including potential service credits, but shall not in itself constitute an Event of Default unless the delay materially and persistently impairs Contoso’s use and Phoenix fails to cure after written notice as provided in **Section 4.3.2(a)** of the Parent Agreement.

2.7 **Contoso’s Obligations Regarding Addendum Premises.**

2.7.1 Contoso shall comply with **Section 2.3 (Contoso’s Obligations Regarding Use and Care)** of the Parent Agreement with respect to the Addendum Premises, including compliance with Applicable Laws and Work Rules, maintenance of interior non-structural elements, and limitations on alterations.

## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Uncapped Liability for High-Risk Allocation.**

Notwithstanding **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement, the Parties agree that, with respect to liabilities arising from or relating to this Addendum and the Addendum Premises, **there shall be no contractual cap on liability**. The limitation of liability provisions in **Section 9.2** of the Parent Agreement (5x fees cap) shall **not apply** to Claims arising under this Addendum.

In light of the High-Risk Allocation and the nature of Contoso’s operations in the Addendum Premises, neither Party shall be excluded from liability for consequential, incidental, or special damages under this Addendum. Accordingly, the exclusion of consequential damages set forth in **Section 9.1** of the Parent Agreement shall **not apply** to Claims arising solely from or relating to this Addendum.

9.3 **Exceptions.**

Nothing in this Addendum shall limit:  
(a) Either Party’s liability for death or personal injury caused by its gross negligence;  
(b) Either Party’s liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or  
(c) Any other liability that cannot be limited or excluded under Applicable Law, consistent with **Section 9.3** of the Parent Agreement.

(b) Maintain Property Insurance for its personal property and trade fixtures in the Addendum Premises at full replacement cost; and
