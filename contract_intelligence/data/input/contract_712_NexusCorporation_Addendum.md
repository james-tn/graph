  - Milestone 6: Transition to steady-state managed support.

Timeframes and Milestones shall be binding once agreed in writing in the applicable SOW, subject to adjustment through the Change Management process described in **Article XIII**.

2.5 **Performance Standards.** Vendor shall perform the Services (a) in a professional and workmanlike manner; (b) in accordance with prevailing industry standards and best practices for similar services; (c) in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and Client policies expressly provided to Vendor in writing; and (d) in accordance with the Service Levels set forth in **Article XII**. Vendor shall ensure that all personnel assigned to the engagement are suitably qualified, experienced, and trained to perform the tasks assigned to them.

2.7 **Risk Level and Approach.** The Parties acknowledge that, for purposes of internal risk profiling, this engagement is classified as **“Low Risk”**. Accordingly, the Parties intend that this Addendum shall contain client-friendly terms, including a reasonable limitation of liability as set out in **Article IX**, a relatively short termination notice period as set out in **Section 4.2**, and balanced, mutual obligations concerning confidentiality, data protection, and indemnification as set out in **Articles V, VIII, and XI**.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.** For purposes of applicable data protection laws:

## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Uptime Commitment.** For any managed services or hosted components provided by Vendor under this Addendum, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the applicable systems are available not less than **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance and emergency maintenance as permitted under this **Article XII**.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.** Vendor may schedule periodic maintenance windows during which services may be unavailable, provided that:

  a. Vendor provides at least five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice of any scheduled maintenance expected to result in downtime; and  
  b. Such scheduled maintenance does not exceed eight (8) hours in any calendar month, unless otherwise agreed by Client.

12.3 **Emergency Maintenance.** Vendor may perform emergency maintenance as needed to address critical vulnerabilities or service interruptions. Vendor shall provide as much advance notice as reasonably practicable and shall work to minimize the duration and impact of emergency maintenance.

12.4 **Incident Response and Resolution.** Vendor shall respond to and resolve service incidents in accordance with the following target Service Levels:

  - **Severity 1 (Critical)** – Complete loss of core functionality with no workaround available.  
    - Initial response: within 1 hour, 24x7.

    - Initial response: within 2 Business Days.  
    - Target resolution or workaround: as part of next scheduled release or maintenance cycle.

12.5 **SLA Credits.** If Vendor fails to meet the uptime commitment in Section 12.1 in any calendar month, Client shall be entitled to a service credit as follows:

  - Uptime between 99.0% and 99.9%: credit equal to 5% of the monthly managed support fee;  
  - Uptime between 98.0% and 98.99%: credit equal to 10% of the monthly managed support fee;  
  - Uptime below 98.0%: credit equal to 20% of the monthly managed support fee.

12.6 **Chronic Service Level Failures.** If Vendor fails to meet the uptime commitment or other core Service Levels in three (3) or more consecutive months, or five (5) or more months in any rolling twelve (12) month period, Client may, in addition to any other rights or remedies, terminate the managed services portion of this Addendum for cause upon thirty (30) days’ written notice, unless Vendor cures such chronic failures within such thirty (30) day period to Client’s reasonable satisfaction.

13.5 **Emergency Changes.** In urgent situations where immediate changes are required to prevent or mitigate material harm to Client’s operations or data, the Parties may agree verbally or via email to a temporary change, provided that a formal written Change Order documenting the agreed change is executed as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.
