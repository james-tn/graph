### FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Incremental Contract Value.**  
The Parties acknowledge and agree that, in addition to the Contract Value of **US $2,240,501** set forth in **Section 3.1 of the Parent DPA**, the aggregate contract value for the Additional Services under this Amendment is **US $3,799,740** (the “**Incremental Contract Value**”), resulting in a combined potential contract value under the Parent Agreement and this Amendment of **US $6,040,241**, subject to adjustments pursuant to this Article III and Article XIII of the Parent DPA.

3.2 **Fee Structure for Additional Services.**  

  3.2.1 **Implementation Fees.** A one-time implementation fee equal to **ten percent (10%)** of the Incremental Contract Value (i.e., **US $379,974**) shall be invoiced upon commencement of the initial expansion and onboarding activities described in **Section 2.4.1** above. This supplements **Section 3.2.1 of the Parent DPA** and shall be payable in accordance with the Net 45 payment terms set forth in **Section 3.3 of this Amendment**.

  3.2.2 **Recurring Service Fees.** Recurring fees for hosting, data processing, and managed services associated with the Additional Services shall be invoiced **monthly in advance** and shall be calculated based on service tiers (e.g., number of regional environments, data storage volume, concurrent users) mutually agreed in writing by the Parties. These recurring fees supplement, and do not replace, the recurring service fees described in **Section 3.2.2 of the Parent DPA**.

  3.2.3 **Usage-Based Fees.** Where applicable, the Parties may agree to usage-based pricing for certain components of the Additional Services (e.g., per-GB log storage beyond baseline allocations, per Data Subject request processed via the self-service tooling).

3.3 **Invoicing; Payment Terms.**  

  3.3.1 Pinnacle shall issue itemized invoices to Contoso reflecting implementation fees, recurring fees, and any usage-based fees for the Additional Services in accordance with this Article III and the Principal Agreement(s).

  3.4.2 Before suspending Additional Services for non-payment, Pinnacle shall follow the same notice and cure procedures described in **Section 3.4.2 of the Parent DPA**, provided that suspension shall be proportionate and shall not unreasonably interfere with Contoso’s compliance with Data Protection Laws.

The expense and reimbursement provisions set forth in **Section 3.5 of the Parent DPA** apply equally to the Additional Services. Pinnacle shall not incur extraordinary expenses (e.g., travel to on-site regulatory audits) related solely to the Additional Services without Contoso’s prior written approval.
