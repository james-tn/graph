   (i) discovery and requirements-gathering workshops;  
   (ii) solution design and architecture documentation;  
   (iii) configuration of modules, workflows, and business rules;  
   (iv) integration with Client’s systems (e.g., ERP, CRM, HRIS, identity solutions);  
   (v) data migration from Client’s legacy systems; and  
   (vi) user acceptance testing support.

(b) Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to perform such Services in a professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. However, Client acknowledges that successful implementation is dependent on Client’s timely provision of information, resources, and decisions as described in Section 2.7.

2.4 **Timeline and Milestones.**  
(a) The Parties shall agree specific milestones, deliverable due dates, and acceptance criteria in the relevant SOW. The target initial production go-live date shall be no later than **July 31, 2025**, subject to mutually agreed changes via the Change Management process in Article XIII.

During the Term, Vendor shall provide Maintenance and Support Services as follows, further detailed in Article XII:  

(a) **Corrective Maintenance**: diagnosis and remediation of reproducible errors, bugs, and defects in the Software;

2.6 **Hosting and Infrastructure.**  
(a) Unless otherwise specified in an SOW, Vendor shall host the production and non-production instances of the Software in a reputable third-party data center or cloud infrastructure provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP), located in a region reasonably aligned with Client’s requirements and applicable Data Protection Laws.  

(b) Vendor shall be responsible for procuring and managing the underlying infrastructure required to host the Software, including operating system updates, security patches, and capacity provisioning.  

(c) Vendor shall maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure security, integrity, and availability of the hosted environment, as further described in Article XI.

2.7 **Client Responsibilities.**  
Client acknowledges and agrees that Vendor’s performance of the Services is dependent on Client’s timely and effective performance of its responsibilities, including:

(f) making timely decisions and approvals in relation to project milestones, Deliverables, and change requests.

Any failure by Client to fulfill its responsibilities under this Section 2.7 shall entitle Vendor to a reasonable extension of any affected timelines and may entitle Vendor to additional fees pursuant to Article XIII.

2.8 **Acceptance of Deliverables.**  
(a) Where an SOW specifies Deliverables subject to acceptance testing, Client shall have the period defined in such SOW (and if not defined, ten (10) Business Days) from delivery to review and either provide written acceptance or a written notice of rejection specifying in reasonable detail the non-conformities with the applicable acceptance criteria.  

(b) If Client fails to provide such notice within the applicable period, the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted.  

(c) If Client timely rejects a Deliverable, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformities and re-deliver the corrected Deliverable. Client shall then have a further review period (not to exceed the original review period) to conduct re-testing.  

(d) Acceptance of a Deliverable shall be deemed to occur when Client provides written acceptance or when deemed accepted pursuant to this Section.

2.9 **High-Risk Acknowledgment.**  
Given the critical nature of the systems and data involved, the Parties acknowledge a **High Risk** profile for this engagement. Accordingly, Client agrees that:  
(a) Vendor may adopt conservative change and release management practices;
