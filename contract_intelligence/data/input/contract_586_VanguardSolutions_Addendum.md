8.2.2 Client’s gross negligence, wilful misconduct, or material breach of this Addendum.

8.3 **Indemnification Procedure.** A Party seeking indemnification (the **“Indemnified Party”**) shall:

8.3.1 promptly notify the other Party (the **“Indemnifying Party”**) in writing of any Claim for which indemnification is sought, provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent it is materially prejudiced thereby;

8.3.2 grant the Indemnifying Party sole control over the defence and settlement of the Claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any admission of fault or non‑monetary obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and

8.3.3 cooperate reasonably with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defence and settlement of the Claim.

8.4 **IP Infringement Remedies.** In the event of a Claim under Section 8.1.1, Vendor may, at its option and expense: (a) procure for Client the right to continue using the affected Deliverables or Services; (b) modify or replace them so that they become non‑infringing while substantially preserving their functionality; or (c) if Vendor reasonably determines that neither (a) nor (b) is commercially feasible, terminate the affected Services or Deliverables and refund to Client the Fees paid by Client for the affected item(s) on a pro rata basis for the remaining portion of the applicable term. This Section 8.4 sets out Vendor’s sole liability, and Client’s exclusive remedy, for any third‑party Intellectual Property Rights infringement claims.

9.3.4 a Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under Article V or its data protection obligations under Article XI, in which case the liability cap shall be increased to one and one‑half (1.5) times the amount set out in Section 9.2.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.** The Parties acknowledge that the limitations and exclusions of liability in this Article IX are reasonable and reflect the allocation of risk between the Parties and the nature of the Services and Fees under this Addendum.

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.** For purposes of Applicable Data Protection Laws, Client shall be considered the **controller** of any Personal Data processed under this Addendum, and Vendor shall act as **processor** (or sub‑processor where applicable) on behalf of Client.

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.** Vendor shall process Personal Data only:

11.2.1 in accordance with Client’s documented instructions (including as set out in this Addendum and any SOW), unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, in which case Vendor shall inform Client of that legal requirement before processing, unless prohibited by law;

  - Response: within 1 hour (24x7).

In such case, Client shall be liable for the Fees incurred during such interim period.

13.5 **No Obligation to Accept Changes.** Neither Party shall be under any obligation to agree to any Change Request proposed by the other Party. However, the Parties shall act reasonably and in good faith when considering Change Requests.
