## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Exclusion of Consequential Damages.**  
Subject to Section 9.3, neither Party shall be liable to the other Party for any Consequential Damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

9.2 **Liability Cap.**  
Subject to Section 9.3, the total aggregate liability of each Party to the other arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, shall be limited to an amount equal to **three (3) times** the total Fees actually paid by Contoso to Cascade under this Agreement in the **twelve (12) months** immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

9.3 **Exceptions.**  
Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit either Party’s liability for:

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in the performance of this Agreement. To the extent that Cascade processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso, the Parties shall enter into a separate data processing agreement or addendum that meets the requirements of Article 28 of the UK GDPR, which shall be incorporated by reference into this Agreement.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  
Unless otherwise specified in a data processing addendum, Contoso shall be the data controller (or equivalent term under applicable law) with respect to Personal Data provided to Cascade, and Cascade shall act as data processor (or equivalent) and shall process such Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
Cascade shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure, or access, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a personal data breach (as defined in Data Protection Laws) affecting Personal Data processed by Cascade on behalf of Contoso, Cascade shall:

  11.4.1 notify Contoso without undue delay and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours after becoming aware of the breach;

  11.4.2 provide reasonable information and cooperation to enable Contoso to meet its legal obligations, including any notification to supervisory authorities and affected data subjects; and

  11.4.3 take all reasonably necessary steps to mitigate the effects of the breach and to prevent its recurrence.

11.5 **Data Transfers.**  
Cascade shall not transfer Personal Data outside the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area (EEA) without Contoso’s prior written consent and, where applicable, shall ensure that appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses or an adequacy decision) are in place.

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Cascade shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes of processing under this Agreement or as required by law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Contoso’s written request, Cascade shall securely delete or return to Contoso all Personal Data processed on Contoso’s behalf, unless applicable law requires further retention.

11.7 **Sub-Processors.**  
Cascade shall not engage any sub-processor to process Personal Data on behalf of Contoso without Contoso’s prior written authorisation. Cascade shall ensure that any authorised sub-processor is bound by written terms imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set out in this Article XI and any applicable data processing addendum.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  
Cascade may perform scheduled maintenance that may affect availability, provided that:

  12.2.1 such maintenance is scheduled, to the extent reasonably possible, outside of Contoso’s core business hours (09:00 to 18:00 UK time, Monday to Friday); and

12.3 **Incident Response Times.**  
Cascade shall respond to support requests within the following timeframes, measured from the time Contoso logs a ticket through the agreed support channel:

  12.3.1 **Severity 1 (Critical):** System down or major business impact – response within one (1) hour, 24x7;

  12.3.2 **Severity 2 (High):** Significant degradation or partial outage – response within four (4) hours during Business Days;

If Cascade fails to meet the Uptime Commitment in any calendar month (a **“Service Level Failure”**), Contoso shall be entitled to SLA Credits as follows:

  12.4.1 Uptime between 99.0% and 99.9%: credit equal to 5% of the monthly Fees for the affected service;

12.5 **Exclusive Remedies for SLA Failures.**  
SLA Credits shall be Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for Service Level Failures, without prejudice to Contoso’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Article IV if such failures constitute a material breach.

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  
Either Party may propose changes to the scope, Specifications, timelines, or other material aspects of the Deliverables or Services by submitting a written Change Request. Each Change Request shall describe the proposed change, the reasons for the change, and any anticipated impact on the Fees, timelines, or Service Levels.

13.2 **Evaluation of Change Requests.**  
Upon receipt of a Change Request, the receiving Party shall review and evaluate the proposed change. Cascade shall, without undue delay, provide Contoso with a written impact assessment describing any effects on the Fees, timelines, resources, and other relevant factors.

13.3 **Approval Process.**  
No Change Request shall be binding unless and until it is agreed in writing by authorised representatives of both Parties. Once approved, the Change Request shall form part of this Agreement (or the relevant Purchase Order) and the Parties shall implement the change accordingly.

13.4 **Disputed Changes.**  
If the Parties are unable to agree on the terms of a Change Request, the Parties shall continue to perform their obligations under the existing terms of this Agreement and the applicable Purchase Orders. Any disputes relating to Change Requests may be escalated and resolved in accordance with Article XIV (Dispute Resolution).

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (a **“Dispute”**), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiations between operational contacts. If the Dispute cannot be resolved within ten (10) Business Days, either Party may escalate the Dispute to senior management. Senior representatives of each Party shall meet (in person or via teleconference) as soon as reasonably practicable and use reasonable efforts to resolve the Dispute within fifteen (15) Business Days.

If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation and escalation in accordance with Section 14.1, the Parties agree to attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through mediation before resorting to litigation.

14.3 **Litigation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days after the appointment of a mediator, or if the Parties fail to agree on a mediator within fifteen (15) days after the request for mediation, either Party may commence proceedings in the courts specified in Section 16.13.

14.4 **Interim Relief.**  
Nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking urgent interim or injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction at any time, where such relief is necessary to protect that Party’s rights or Confidential Information or to prevent irreparable harm.

## ARTICLE XV – FORCE MAJEURE

15.1 **Definition.**  
A **“Force Majeure Event”** means any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, civil unrest, strikes or other labour disputes (excluding strikes or disputes involving the affected Party’s own workforce), epidemics or pandemics, fire, flood, natural disasters, acts of government, or interruptions or failures of telecommunications or power supplies not caused by the affected Party.

15.2 **Effect of Force Majeure.**  
Neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement (other than payment obligations) to the extent such failure or delay is due to a Force Majeure Event, provided that the affected Party:
