The DTAP shall, at a minimum, include:

  (a) **Strategic Roadmap & Enterprise Architecture** – Vendor will develop and maintain a rolling 36‑month transformation roadmap covering Client’s enterprise platforms, integrating the technology strategy and solution architecture efforts contemplated in Section 2.2.1 of the Parent Agreement.

TPMO will manage the consolidated project portfolio, cross‑project dependencies, risk and issue management, and executive reporting to Client stakeholders.

  (c) **Cloud Migration & Modernization** – Vendor will plan and execute migration of designated legacy workloads to cloud platforms, extending the data migration and transformation services in Section 2.2.4 of the Parent Agreement. Activities include workload assessment, migration runbooks, environment provisioning, and phased cutovers.

  (d) **Managed Application Services** – Vendor shall provide ongoing support and maintenance for certain in‑scope applications and platforms specified in the applicable Incremental SOWs.

  (e) **Change Management & Training at Scale** – Vendor will expand the training, knowledge transfer, and documentation activities described in Section 2.2.6 of the Parent Agreement to cover multiple business units and geographies, including role‑based training plans, e‑learning content, and train‑the‑trainer programs.

Vendor shall coordinate these phases with Client’s internal program governance processes.

Without limiting the definition of Deliverables in Section 1.9 of the Parent Agreement, the Amendment Deliverables shall include, at a minimum:

2.4.2 Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with Section 2.5 (“Performance Standards”) of the Parent Agreement, to meet the timelines and milestones specified in each Incremental SOW. Delays attributable to Client, including delayed approvals, access, or decisions as described in Section 2.6 of the Parent Agreement, shall entitle Vendor to equitable schedule adjustments and, where applicable, fee adjustments, to be documented in a Change Order (Amendment).

2.5 **Performance Standards and Enhanced Service Levels.**  
2.5.1 Vendor shall perform the Amendment Services in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with the standards set forth in Section 2.5.1 of the Parent Agreement and the Enhanced Service Levels in Article XII of this Amendment.  

2.5.2 For managed services components of the DTAP, Vendor’s performance shall be measured against the Enhanced Service Levels (e.g., 99.9% uptime, incident response and resolution targets) as set forth in Article XII and the applicable SOWs.  

2.5.3 Failure to meet Enhanced Service Levels shall give rise to the credits or remedies specified in Article XII and the applicable SOWs, which shall be **Client’s primary contractual remedy** for service level failures, **without prejudice** to the broader rights and remedies of Vendor and Client under the Parent Agreement and this Amendment, including the uncapped liability and indemnification provisions of Articles VIII and IX of this Amendment.

2.6 **Subcontractors and Resource Management.**  
2.6.1 Section 2.7 of the Parent Agreement (Subcontractors) shall apply to the Amendment Services. Vendor may, in its discretion, use subcontractors and global delivery centers to perform portions of the DTAP, provided Vendor remains responsible for their acts and omissions.  

2.6.2 Given the high‑risk, mission‑critical nature of the DTAP, Client acknowledges that Vendor may allocate senior “anchor” resources and specialized SMEs to key phases of the program and may adjust staffing levels in response to program demands, provided that Vendor continues to meet its obligations under the Enhanced Service Levels.

2.7 **Client Responsibilities (Supplemental).**  
2.7.1 In addition to the Client Responsibilities in Section 2.6 of the Parent Agreement, Client shall:

  (c) ensure that third‑party vendors and partners under Client’s control cooperate with and provide necessary information and access to Vendor.

2.7.2 Client’s failure to perform its responsibilities under this Section 2.7 or Section 2.6 of the Parent Agreement may result in delays, additional costs, or changes in scope, which shall be addressed via a Change Order (Amendment).

2.8 **Relationship to Existing SOWs and Change Orders.**  
2.8.1 All existing SOWs executed under the Parent Agreement prior to the Amendment Effective Date remain in full force and effect, except that, to the extent those SOWs expressly reference or are updated by this Amendment, the terms of this Amendment shall govern.  

2.8.2 New SOWs relating to the DTAP shall expressly reference both the Parent Agreement (CSA‑ZEN‑202507‑213) and this Amendment (AMD‑ZEN‑202507‑356) and shall be deemed Incremental SOWs forming part of the overall Agreement (as defined in Section 1.2 of the Parent Agreement) as amended hereby.

3.3.1 **Section 3.3.1 (“Payment Terms”) of the Parent Agreement is hereby amended and superseded solely with respect to the Amendment Services** to read as follows:

For clarity, this license is more restrictive than the royalty‑free license in Section 6.3.2 of the Parent Agreement and is intended to reflect the high‑value, vendor‑proprietary nature of the tools used in the DTAP.

6.4 **Restrictions on Use.**  
6.4.1 Client shall not, and shall not permit any third party to, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code or underlying structure of any software constituting Vendor Core IP, except to the limited extent that such activity is expressly permitted by Applicable Law notwithstanding a contractual prohibition.
