12.2 **Response and Resolution Times.**  
(a) Service Provider shall respond to maintenance requests as follows:

  - Repeated failure to meet the 99.9% uptime commitment for critical systems in two (2) or more months in any twelve (12)-month period may entitle Company to a service credit equal to up to two percent (2%) of the monthly Base Rent for each affected month;  
  - Chronic failure to meet response times for emergency issues (e.g., more than three instances in any six (6)-month period without reasonable justification) may entitle Company to an additional one percent (1%) credit of monthly Base Rent per occurrence, up to a reasonable aggregate cap to be agreed.  

The Parties shall negotiate in good faith any additional service credits or remedies where persistent Service Level failures materially impact Company’s operations, without prejudice to Company’s rights under **Section 4.5(a)**.
