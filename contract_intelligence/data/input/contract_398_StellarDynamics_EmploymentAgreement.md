## ARTICLE XI  
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with the processing of Personal Data under this Agreement. To the extent Stellar Dynamics processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso, Stellar Dynamics shall be deemed a “processor” and Contoso a “controller” (as such terms are defined in GDPR), and the Parties shall comply with the provisions set forth in this Article XI and any data processing addendum mutually agreed and incorporated by reference.

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.** Stellar Dynamics shall:

  (a) process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso and only for the purposes of performing the Services and as otherwise set forth in this Agreement;  

  (b) ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data are bound by appropriate confidentiality obligations;  

  (c) implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, as required by Data Protection Laws;  

  (d) not transfer Personal Data outside the country of origin or outside the European Economic Area (where applicable) without obtaining Contoso’s prior written consent and ensuring appropriate transfer mechanisms (e.g., standard contractual clauses) are in place.

11.3 **Sub-Processors.** Stellar Dynamics shall not engage any sub-processor to process Personal Data without Contoso’s prior written consent. Where such consent is given, Stellar Dynamics shall ensure that any sub-processor is bound by data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement, and Stellar Dynamics shall remain fully liable for the acts and omissions of any sub-processor.

11.4 **Data Subject Rights.** Stellar Dynamics shall, taking into account the nature of the processing, assist Contoso by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as possible, in complying with obligations to respond to requests from data subjects seeking to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (including rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection). Stellar Dynamics shall promptly notify Contoso of any such requests it receives directly and shall not respond except in accordance with Contoso’s instructions.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized access to, or disclosure, loss, or destruction of, Personal Data (a “**Data Breach**”) processed by Stellar Dynamics under this Agreement, Stellar Dynamics shall:

  (a) notify Contoso in writing without undue delay, and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of becoming aware of such Data Breach;  

  (b) provide Contoso with all information reasonably required to meet any reporting or notification obligations to regulators or affected data subjects, to the extent such obligations apply to Contoso;  

  (c) cooperate with Contoso in investigating, mitigating, and remediating the Data Breach; and  

  (d) not make any public statement regarding the Data Breach without Contoso’s prior written consent, unless required by law.

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Stellar Dynamics shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by applicable law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Contoso’s earlier written request, Stellar Dynamics shall delete or return to Contoso all Personal Data, and shall certify in writing its compliance with this obligation, except to the extent retention is required by law (and, in such case, Stellar Dynamics shall continue to protect such Personal Data in accordance with this Agreement).

11.7 **Security Audits.** Upon Contoso’s reasonable prior written notice, and no more than once per twelve (12) month period (unless in response to a Data Breach), Stellar Dynamics shall make available to Contoso information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this **Article XI**, and shall cooperate in any audits or inspections requested by Contoso or its regulators, provided that such audits do not unreasonably interfere with Stellar Dynamics’ normal business operations and do not require disclosure of proprietary or confidential information unrelated to the Services.

## ARTICLE XII  
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.4 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.** If Stellar Dynamics fails to meet any Service Level in a category for three (3) consecutive months, or for any three (3) months in a rolling six (6) month period, Contoso shall be entitled to the following remedies:

  (a) Service credits, calculated as a percentage (e.g., 5%–15%) of the monthly Fees for the affected service, as further specified in the applicable SOW;  

  (b) The right to require Stellar Dynamics to develop and implement a remedial action plan to prevent recurrence; and  

  (c) If Service Levels are materially and repeatedly not met and not cured within sixty (60) days of notice, the right to terminate the affected SOW for cause under **Section 4.4**, without penalty.

Service credits shall be Contoso’s sole monetary remedy for SLA breaches, but shall not preclude Contoso from seeking other remedies for any associated material breach of this Agreement.

## ARTICLE XIV  
DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.** In the event of any Dispute, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally through negotiations between executives empowered to settle the Dispute. Either Party may initiate such negotiations by providing written notice to the other Party describing the nature of the Dispute.

The senior management representatives shall meet (in person or via videoconference) within fifteen (15) days after escalation to attempt to resolve the Dispute.

14.3 **Mediation.** If the Dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) days after initial notice, either Party may request that the Dispute be submitted to non-binding mediation before a mutually agreed mediator in King County, Washington. The Parties shall share equally in the mediator’s fees and expenses, and each shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs.

14.4 **Arbitration / Litigation.** If the Dispute is not resolved by mediation within ninety (90) days of the initial notice of Dispute, then, unless the Parties agree otherwise in writing, the Dispute shall be finally resolved as follows:

  (a) **Arbitration Option.** If both Parties agree in writing, the Dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, by a panel of one (1) arbitrator, in King County, Washington. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding, and judgment may be entered thereon in any court of competent jurisdiction.

  (b) **Default to Litigation.** If the Parties do not mutually agree to arbitration, either Party may bring an action in the state or federal courts located in King County, Washington, and each Party hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection to venue or forum non conveniens.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek interim or injunctive relief (including temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions) from any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information or Intellectual Property Rights, without first following the procedures in this Article XIV.

14.6 **Continued Performance.** During the pendency of any Dispute, Stellar Dynamics shall continue to perform the Services and Contoso shall continue to pay undisputed amounts in accordance with this Agreement, unless this Agreement has been terminated.
