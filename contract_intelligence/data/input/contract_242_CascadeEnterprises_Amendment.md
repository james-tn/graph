## ARTICLE II  
SCOPE OF SERVICES AND MODIFIED PREMISES TERMS

2.1 **General Relationship to Parent Agreement.**  

2.1.1 This Amendment **modifies certain lease terms** and adds Project Services relating to the Premises, as originally described in **Section 2.1 (Premises Description)** and **Section 2.3 (Services Provided by Cascade)** of the Lease Agreement. Except as expressly modified herein, all rights and obligations regarding the Premises, Services, and Leasehold Improvements remain governed by the Lease Agreement (Ref: **LSE-CAS-202504-234**, **contract_234**).

2.1.2 The Parties acknowledge that the Lease Agreement established a comprehensive statement of their rights and obligations regarding the Premises and the Services. This Amendment is intended to refine those obligations during the Amendment Term, including a partial reconfiguration of the Premises, adjustments to rent, and the introduction of Project Services described in this Article II.

2.2 **Amended Premises Configuration.**

2.2.1 **Scope of Amended Premises.** Effective as of the Amendment Effective Date, the Parties agree that, for the duration of the Amendment Term, the lease terms for the following portion of the Premises shall be modified (collectively, the “Amended Premises”):

  (a) The entirety of the **20th floor** and **21st floor** portions of the Premises (collectively approximately **30,000 rentable square feet**) shall remain leased on substantially the same terms as set forth in the Lease Agreement, subject to Adjusted Base Rent and additional Project Services under this Amendment; and  

  (b) The **22nd floor** portion of the Premises (approximately **15,000 rentable square feet**) shall be reconfigured such that Contoso will (i) consolidate its operations into approximately **10,000 rentable square feet** on the 22nd floor, with enhanced data center and technology development configurations, and (ii) temporarily surrender and allow Cascade to remarket the remaining **approximately 5,000 rentable square feet** on the 22nd floor during the Amendment Term pursuant to **Section 2.2.3**.

2.2.2 **Floor Plan Updates.** Cascade shall, within thirty (30) days after the Amendment Effective Date, prepare updated floor plans (“Updated Floor Plans”) reflecting the Amended Premises configuration and attach such Updated Floor Plans as **Exhibit A-1** to this Amendment. The Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to verify rentable square footage in accordance with the principles set forth in **Section 2.1.2** of the Lease Agreement. Minor variations in measured area not exceeding three percent (3%) shall not entitle Contoso to further rent reduction beyond the adjustments expressly stated in **Article III** of this Amendment.

2.2.3 **Temporary Surrender and Remarketing.**  

  (a) Contoso agrees that Cascade may remarket and lease to other tenants the approximately 5,000 rentable square feet being temporarily surrendered on the 22nd floor for the duration of the Amendment Term.  

  (b) During the Amendment Term, Contoso shall not be obligated to pay Base Rent or Operating Expenses attributable to such surrendered 5,000 rentable square feet, and Adjusted Base Rent under **Section 3.2** shall be calculated accordingly.  

  (c) As of the Amendment Expiration Date, unless otherwise agreed in writing, the Parties shall confer in good faith to determine whether Contoso will (i) re-assume leasehold rights to such 5,000 rentable square feet, (ii) permanently surrender such space in a further amendment to the Lease Agreement, or (iii) agree on another configuration.

2.3 **Project Services – Overview.**

2.3.1 In addition to the Services specified in **Section 2.3 (Services Provided by Cascade)** of the Lease Agreement, Cascade shall provide the Project Services described in this Article II. These Project Services are designed to facilitate Contoso’s consolidation, enhanced technology usage, and operational optimization across the Amended Premises during the Amendment Term.

2.3.2 The Project Services shall include, without limitation:

  (b) **Expanded Security Services** – enhanced access control, additional key-card readers, expanded CCTV coverage for the 22nd floor data center spaces, and coordination with Contoso’s internal security policies, supplementing **Section 2.3.1 (Building Access & Security)** of the Lease Agreement;  

  (c) **Enhanced Environmental Controls and After-Hours HVAC Management** – refined HVAC zoning, supplemental cooling for high-density equipment on the 22nd floor, and pre-scheduled after-hours HVAC services, coordinated with **Section 2.3.2 (HVAC and Environmental Controls)** and **Section 3.4.3** of the Lease Agreement;

2.4.2 **Expanded Security Services.** Cascade shall:

  (a) Install and maintain incremental key-card readers and access zones to restrict and monitor access to sensitive areas identified by Contoso, including but not limited to the consolidated 22nd floor data center and technology development rooms.  

  (b) Expand CCTV camera coverage in common areas immediately adjacent to the Amended Premises and in access paths to designated critical rooms, consistent with applicable privacy laws and **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)** of the Lease Agreement.

  (a) From March 02, 2026, through April 26, 2027, Contoso shall pay to Cascade monthly **Adjusted Base Rent** of **US $118,500 per month** for the Amended Premises, reflecting (i) the exclusion of approximately 5,000 rentable square feet on the 22nd floor that is temporarily surrendered and (ii) a modest premium for the Enhanced Project Services infrastructure.  

  (b) To the extent that the Base Rent schedule in **Section 3.2.2** of the Lease Agreement would otherwise apply to the entirety of the 45,000 rentable square feet, such schedule shall be deemed revised for the Amendment Term, solely with respect to the Amended Premises, to align with the Adjusted Base Rent stated above.  

  (c) For the avoidance of doubt, upon expiration or earlier termination of this Amendment, the Base Rent provisions of the Lease Agreement will continue (and resume, as applicable) in accordance with the original schedule, subject to any subsequent amendments agreed in writing.

3.2.2 All other provisions of **Section 3.2** of the Lease Agreement (including the acknowledgement of factors used to determine Base Rent) remain in full force and effect, except to the limited extent modified above.

3.3 **Project Services Fees; Additional Rent.**

  (d) **Enhanced Janitorial Fee:** A fixed fee of **US $3,000 per month** for enhanced janitorial and specialty cleaning services for sensitive areas.

3.3.2 Cascade shall provide reasonable documentation supporting usage-based charges, including meter readings and applicable rate multipliers. Such documentation shall accompany each monthly invoice.

3.4 **Payment Terms; Net 60; Disputes.**

3.4.1 The payment terms under **Section 3.3 (Payment Terms; Net 60)** of the Lease Agreement shall apply to all amounts due under this Amendment. All undisputed amounts invoiced by Cascade (including Adjusted Base Rent, Additional Rent, and Project Services Fees) shall be due and payable by Contoso within **sixty (60) calendar days** of the invoice date (“Net 60”).

3.4.2 Contoso shall have the right to dispute in good faith any portion of an invoice by providing written notice to Cascade within thirty (30) days of receipt, specifying the disputed amount and the basis for the dispute, consistent with **Section 3.3.2** of the Lease Agreement. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any disputed amounts within thirty (30) days.

3.5 **Late Payments; Interest.**

3.5.1 The provisions of **Section 3.5 (Late Payments; Interest; Remedies)** of the Lease Agreement shall apply to this Amendment, provided, however, that in light of the Low-risk nature of this Amendment:

  (a) Interest on undisputed past-due amounts shall accrue at the lesser of (i) one percent (1.0%) per month or (ii) the maximum rate allowed by applicable law (instead of 1.5% as in the Lease Agreement).  

  (b) Cascade shall provide an additional ten (10) days’ written notice and opportunity to cure before suspending any Project Services due to non-payment.

3.6 **Expenses and Reimbursements.**

3.6.1 The reimbursement provisions set forth in **Section 3.7** of the Lease Agreement shall apply to any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Cascade at Contoso’s request in connection with the Project Services, including Enhanced Fit-Out Adjustments, subject to prior written approval by Contoso.
