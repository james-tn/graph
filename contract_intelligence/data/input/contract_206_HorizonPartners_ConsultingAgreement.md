  (a) the Company’s breach of this Agreement or any SOW;  

  (b) the Company’s use of the Services or Work Product, including business decisions or actions taken based on recommendations or Deliverables provided by the Service Provider;  

  (c) any claim that the Client Materials or the Company’s use of the Services or Work Product infringes any Intellectual Property Rights or violates the rights of any Third Party;  

  (d) the Company’s violation of Applicable Law, including Data Protection Laws, in connection with its use of the Services or Work Product; or  

  (e) bodily injury, death, or damage to tangible property caused by the acts or omissions of the Company or its Representatives.

8.2 **Indemnification by the Service Provider (Limited).**  
The Service Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, and employees (collectively, “**Company Indemnitees**”) from and against any Losses arising out of or relating to any Third Party claim that the Work Product, as delivered by the Service Provider and used by the Company in accordance with this Agreement, directly infringes any U.S. patent, copyright, or trademark, or misappropriates any trade secret of such Third Party, provided that this indemnity shall not apply to any claim to the extent resulting from:

  (a) the Company’s modification of the Work Product (other than modifications made by the Service Provider);  

  (b) the Company’s combination of the Work Product with any products, services, or materials not provided by the Service Provider;  

  (c) the Company’s continued use of the Work Product after the Service Provider has recommended cessation or replacement to avoid further infringement; or  

  (d) the Company’s breach of this Agreement or misuse of the Work Product.

8.3 **Indemnification Procedures.**  
A Party seeking indemnification under this Article VIII (the “**Indemnified Party**”) shall:

  (a) promptly notify the other Party (the “**Indemnifying Party**”) in writing of any claim for which indemnification is sought, provided that failure to provide prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent it is materially prejudiced by such failure;  

  (b) permit the Indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of the claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim in a manner that imposes any admission of liability or non-monetary obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent; and  

  (c) provide reasonable cooperation and assistance to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, in defending against the claim.

8.4 **Infringement Remedies.**  
If the Work Product is, or in the Service Provider’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, the Service Provider may, at its option and expense:

  (a) procure for the Company the right to continue using the Work Product;  

  (b) replace or modify the Work Product so that it becomes non-infringing while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or  

  (c) if (a) and (b) are not commercially reasonable, terminate the Company’s license to the infringing Work Product upon written notice and refund to the Company the portion of Fees paid for such Work Product, less a reasonable allocation for the value received by the Company prior to termination.

8.5 **Exclusive Remedy.**  
The indemnification obligations set forth in this Article VIII constitute the Parties’ sole and exclusive remedies, and the Indemnifying Party’s entire liability, with respect to any Third Party claims described in this Article VIII, subject to the limitations (or absence thereof) set forth in Article IX.

## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **No Cap on Liability (High Risk).**  
IN VIEW OF THE HIGH-RISK NATURE OF THE ENGAGEMENT, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THERE SHALL BE **NO CONTRACTUAL MONETARY CAP** ON THE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THIS MEANS THAT THE TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE CONTRACTUALLY LIMITED TO A SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNT.

9.2 **Consequential and Other Damages (Not Excluded).**  
Given the high-risk designation and the Parties’ explicit intent to allocate risk broadly in favor of the Service Provider, the Parties agree that NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED OR EXCLUDED ANY RIGHT TO RECOVER CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR LOSS OF DATA, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. ANY PRIOR COURSE OF DEALING OR TYPICAL INDUSTRY LIMITATIONS ON SUCH DAMAGES SHALL NOT APPLY.

9.3 **Allocation of Risk.**  
The Company acknowledges that:

  (a) the Fees and other terms of this Agreement reflect an allocation of risk that is more favorable to the Service Provider than might be found in lower-risk engagements;  

  (b) the Company has had the opportunity to negotiate this allocation of risk and to seek independent legal counsel; and  

  (c) the absence of a liability cap and the inclusion of consequential and similar damages were material inducements to the Service Provider entering into this Agreement.

9.4 **Limitations under Law.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or exclude any liability to the extent such limitation or exclusion is prohibited by Applicable Law, including liability for fraud, intentional misconduct, or any other liability that cannot be limited or excluded as a matter of law.

## ARTICLE X  
## INSURANCE

  (b) **Professional Liability / Errors and Omissions** insurance with limits of not less than $5,000,000 per claim and in the aggregate, covering claims arising out of the Services;  

  (c) **Cyber Liability / Network Security and Privacy** insurance with limits of not less than $3,000,000 per claim and in the aggregate, covering data breaches, privacy violations, and related incidents; and  

  (d) **Workers’ Compensation and Employer’s Liability** insurance as required by Applicable Law in the jurisdictions where the Services are performed.

To the extent commercially reasonable, the Company shall be named as an additional insured on the Service Provider’s Commercial General Liability policy for claims arising out of the Services.

10.3 **Certificates of Insurance.**  
Upon the Company’s written request, the Service Provider shall provide certificates of insurance evidencing the coverage required under this Article X. The Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Company with at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice of any cancellation or material reduction in coverage.

10.4 **No Limitation.**  
The Service Provider’s maintenance of insurance under this Article X shall not be construed as limiting or restricting its obligations or liability under this Agreement, including Article IX.

11.5 **International Transfers.**  
To the extent the Service Provider transfers Personal Data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland to a jurisdiction that has not been recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards as required by Data Protection Laws (e.g., standard contractual clauses), and such safeguards shall be incorporated into the DPA, if applicable.

11.6 **CCPA as Service Provider.**  
To the extent the CCPA applies and the Service Provider processes Personal Data that is “personal information” as defined by the CCPA on behalf of the Company, the Parties agree that:

  (a) the Service Provider is a “service provider” (as defined under the CCPA);  

  (b) the Service Provider shall not sell or share personal information, nor retain, use, or disclose personal information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the Services; and  

  (c) the Service Provider shall not combine personal information received from the Company with personal information received from other sources, except as permitted under the CCPA.
