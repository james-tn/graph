2.3.2 Epsilon shall maintain building systems at a service level consistent with or better than comparable first-class commercial office buildings in the surrounding area, as already required, but with explicit recognition that:

## ARTICLE III – FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Revised Contract Value.** The Parties acknowledge and agree that, taking into account the Extended Term and the enhanced services described herein, the **total estimated contract value** of the Lease for the remainder of the Parent Term plus the Extended Term (the “**Revised Contract Value**”) is **Three Million Two Hundred One Thousand One Hundred Sixty-Three U.S. Dollars (US$3,201,163)**. This Revised Contract Value:

- Supersedes the illustrative Contract Value of **US$1,246,178** stated in **Section 3.1** of the Parent Agreement solely with respect to the period commencing on the Amendment Effective Date and continuing through the Amendment Expiration Date; and  
- Is inclusive of Base Rent and projected Additional Rent and charges, subject to actual reconciliation in accordance with **Section 3.3** of the Parent Agreement.

3.2.1 **Rent Schedule.** The Parties shall, within sixty (60) days of the Amendment Effective Date, memorialize a detailed rent schedule for the remainder of the Parent Term and the Extended Term in an updated **Exhibit C (Rent Schedule)**. In the event of any conflict between this Amendment and Exhibit C, the updated Exhibit C shall prevail with respect to the amount and timing of Base Rent.

3.2.2 **Annual Adjustments.** Annual Base Rent adjustments during the Extended Term shall be at a rate not to exceed __% per Lease Year (to be mutually agreed in the updated Exhibit C), reflecting market rate escalations consistent with the “then-prevailing market rates” concept referenced in **Section 4.2 (Renewal Options)** of the Parent Agreement, but specifically applied to the Extended Term agreed herein.

3.3 **Additional Rent; Operating Expenses.** The obligations regarding Additional Rent under **Section 3.3** of the Parent Agreement remain unchanged, except that:

(a) During the Extended Term, Epsilon shall provide Contoso with an annual estimate and year-end reconciliation with a greater level of detail reasonably sufficient for Contoso to understand major expense categories (e.g., CAM, utilities, insurance, Real Property Taxes), consistent with good property management practices.  

(b) Contoso shall continue to pay its proportionate share of such expenses as Additional Rent, subject to Contoso’s right to request reasonable supporting documentation and to dispute amounts in accordance with **Section 3.7 (Disputed Amounts)**.

3.4 **Revised Payment Terms; Invoices.** **Section 3.4 (Payment Terms; Invoices)** of the Parent Agreement is hereby **amended and restated** solely as to payment timing as follows:

3.4.1 **Due Date.** Base Rent and estimated monthly Additional Rent shall be due in advance on the first (1st) day of each calendar month; provided, however, that Contoso shall have **forty-five (45) calendar days (Net 45)** from the date of Epsilon’s invoice to remit payment without being deemed late. All other Fees, including pass-through costs and special services requested by Contoso, shall also be due **Net 45** days from the date of Epsilon’s invoice. This modifies the previous **Net 30** terms in **Section 3.4.1** of the Parent Agreement.

3.4.2 **Method of Payment.** The methods and currency of payment set forth in **Section 3.4.2** of the Parent Agreement remain unchanged; Contoso shall continue to reference Contract Reference Number **LSE-EPS-202501-106** and, where practical, this Amendment’s reference **AMD-EPS-202501-147** on all payments and remittances.

3.5 **Late Payment; Interest.** The late payment and interest provisions in **Section 3.6** of the Parent Agreement remain applicable, except that the Parties agree, in recognition of the low-risk, client-friendly nature of this Amendment, that:

- Epsilon shall provide written notice and a cure period of at least ten (10) Business Days before assessing late fees or interest; and  
- Epsilon may waive late fees one (1) time per Lease Year, in its reasonable discretion, for delayed payments not exceeding ten (10) days beyond the Net 45 due date.

3.6 **Expenses and Reimbursements.** The expense reimbursement framework in **Section 3.9** of the Parent Agreement remains fully in effect for this Amendment, with the additional expectation that Epsilon will:

- Provide reasonable documentation for any extraordinary or non-routine out-of-pocket expenses; and  
- Seek Contoso’s written approval (email sufficient) before incurring any single Contoso-requested reimbursable expense exceeding US$10,000, unless such expense is clearly contemplated as part of after-hours HVAC, special cleaning, or similar services already described in the Lease.

3.7 **No Setoff; Credits.** **Section 3.10 (No Setoff)** of the Parent Agreement remains applicable. However, SLA Credits described in **Article XII** of the Parent Agreement, as supplemented in this Amendment, shall:

- Be applied as credits against future invoices (Base Rent or Additional Rent) as expressly permitted under **Section 12.3**; and  
- Not be deemed an impermissible setoff, but rather a contractually authorized reduction.

(a) Pays all Fees due through the effective date of termination; and  
(b) Pays an early termination fee equal to **two (2) months’ then-current Base Rent** (reduced from three (3) months under Section 4.3.1), as an agreed reasonable estimate of Epsilon’s costs and damages.

4.3.2 **By Epsilon.** Epsilon’s termination for convenience rights under **Section 4.3.2** remain as stated (ninety (90) days’ prior written notice), with the additional obligation that Epsilon shall, upon request, reasonably cooperate to assist Contoso with an orderly transition of operations, including access for removal of personal property and coordination for overlapping occupancy in the event Contoso secures new premises before the effective termination date.

4.4 **Termination for Cause.** **Section 4.4 (Termination for Cause)** remains in full force and effect. No modifications are made herein, except that the Extended Term and revised payment terms shall be taken into account when determining any uncured material breach and resulting remedies.

4.5 **Effect of Termination of Parent Agreement on this Amendment.** This Amendment is an integral part of and shall not survive the termination of the Parent Agreement, except as follows:

(a) If the Parent Agreement is properly terminated under **Article IV**, this Amendment shall automatically terminate on the same effective date of termination, and all rights and obligations hereunder shall cease, except those intended to survive (see **Section 4.7** and **Section 16.12** of the Parent Agreement and corresponding provisions herein).  

(b) Any amounts due under this Amendment (including early termination fees, if applicable) shall become due and payable as part of the Parties’ post-termination reconciliation of obligations under the Parent Agreement.

4.6 **Surrender of Premises.** The obligations under **Section 4.6 (Surrender of Premises)** of the Parent Agreement apply equally to the surrender of the Premises upon the Amendment Expiration Date or any earlier termination date occurring during the Amendment Term.

4.7 **Survival.** The provisions of **Section 4.7 (Effect of Termination)** of the Parent Agreement remain applicable. Any provisions of this Amendment that by their nature should survive expiration or termination (including payment obligations accrued, confidentiality, IP, indemnity, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution) shall so survive and be read in harmony with **Section 16.12** of the Parent Agreement.
