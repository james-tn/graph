## ARTICLE IX  
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Modification of Parent Agreement Liability Regime for Extended Program.**  
The Parties acknowledge that Section 9.1 of the Parent Agreement provides for an **uncapped** liability regime, reflecting the “high-risk nature” of the original engagement. In light of the **Medium Risk Classification** of the Extended Program under this Addendum, the Parties agree to the following modified limitation of liability for all claims **arising solely under or in connection with this Addendum**:

9.1.1 **Aggregate Cap.**  
Except as set forth in Section 9.3 below, the aggregate liability of either Party to the other for all claims, damages, losses, and expenses arising out of or in connection with this Addendum, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall not exceed **three (3) times the total Addendum Fees paid and payable by the Client to the Service Provider under this Addendum in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.

9.1.2 For avoidance of doubt, this cap applies only to claims under this Addendum and does not retroactively amend the no-cap provision in Section 9.1 of the Parent Agreement for claims arising solely under the Parent Agreement.

9.2 **Exclusion of Consequential Damages.**  
Notwithstanding Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement, which provides that consequential and similar damages are recoverable, the Parties agree that, for claims arising under or in connection with this Addendum, **neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, loss of revenue, or loss of goodwill**, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

9.3 **Exceptions.**  
The limitations in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 of this Addendum shall not apply to:

9.3.1 Death or personal injury caused by a Party’s negligence;  
9.3.2 Fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;  
9.3.3 Breach of confidentiality obligations under Article V of the Parent Agreement and this Addendum;  
9.3.4 Infringement of intellectual property rights covered by the Service Provider’s indemnity under Article VIII of the Parent Agreement and this Addendum;  
9.3.5 Any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.**  
The Parties acknowledge that the limitation of liability and exclusion of certain damages under this Article IX are reasonable in light of the Addendum Contract Value, scope, and Medium Risk Classification and that such provisions constitute an essential basis of the bargain between the Parties.

---

## ARTICLE X  
INSURANCE

10.1 **Insurance Coverage.**  
The insurance requirements in Article X of the Parent Agreement shall remain in effect and apply for the duration of the Addendum Term and for at least one (1) year thereafter. Given the extended global footprint and Enhanced Managed Services, the Service Provider shall ensure that:

(a) The Professional Indemnity, Cyber Liability/Data Breach, and Commercial General Liability coverage is maintained at levels no less than those specified in Section 10.1 of the Parent Agreement; and  
(b) Coverage is extended, where necessary, to territories where Regional Instances are hosted or where major operations occur.

10.2 **Certificates of Insurance.**  
Upon the Client’s reasonable request (which may occur annually), the Service Provider shall provide updated certificates of insurance evidencing continued coverage and shall notify the Client of any material reduction in coverage in accordance with Section 10.2 of the Parent Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE XI  
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Incorporation of Parent Agreement Data Protection Terms.**  
Article XI of the Parent Agreement (Data Protection and Privacy) shall govern the processing of Personal Data under this Addendum. The Client remains generally the “data controller” and the Service Provider the “data processor” with respect to Client Data.

11.2 **Regulatory Expansion Requirements.**  
For the Extended Program, the Parties acknowledge that additional data protection and privacy regimes may apply (e.g., local European data protection laws supplementing GDPR, US state privacy laws supplementing CCPA). The Service Provider shall:

(a) Process Personal Data in accordance with documented instructions from the Client that reflect such additional regulatory requirements; and  
(b) Support the Client in assessing cross-border transfers and implementing appropriate safeguards (e.g., updated Standard Contractual Clauses) for transfers outside the EEA or other regions as required.

11.3 **Data Breach Notification.**  
The data breach notification obligations in Section 11.4 of the Parent Agreement remain in effect, including notification within seventy-two (72) hours of becoming aware of a confirmed Personal Data breach affecting Client Data.

11.4 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Upon expiration or termination of this Addendum, the Service Provider shall handle Client Data in accordance with Section 11.5 of the Parent Agreement. If the Extended Program has resulted in additional data sets or backups, the Service Provider shall ensure that these are included in the return or deletion process and shall provide a deletion certificate upon reasonable request.

11.5 **Security Enhancements.**  
The Service Provider shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Client Data, including Security Enhancements described in Section 2.6.2(e), consistent with Section 11.3 of the Parent Agreement.

## ARTICLE XII  
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Relationship to Parent Agreement SLA.**  
Article XII of the Parent Agreement defines baseline Service Levels, including a 99.9% uptime commitment and specific incident response and resolution targets. This Article XII supplements those commitments for the Extended Program.

12.2 **Global Uptime Commitment.**  
The Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that each production Regional Instance achieves **99.9%** uptime per calendar month, measured individually by region, excluding scheduled maintenance and Force Majeure Events, consistent with Section 12.1 of the Parent Agreement.

12.3 **Regional Incident Response.**  
For global operations, the Service Provider shall maintain regional coverage so that:

(a) Severity 1 incidents impacting any Regional Instance are responded to within **1 hour, 24x7**, and targeted for resolution or workaround within **4 hours**, as per Section 12.3.1 of the Parent Agreement;  
(b) Severity 2 incidents receive a response within **2 hours (Business Days, local regional business hours)** and resolution or workaround within **8 hours**;  
(c) Severity 3 and Severity 4 incidents are handled as per Sections 12.3.3 and 12.3.4 of the Parent Agreement, with reasonable consideration for regional time zones.

12.4 **Global Service Credits.**  
Service credits defined in Section 12.4 of the Parent Agreement shall apply on a per-Regional Instance basis. Service credits shall be calculated as a percentage of the monthly Enhanced Managed Services Fee associated with the affected region (which may be allocated proportionally if a single monthly fee covers multiple regions). The Parties may further refine the allocation in a Conforming Change Order.

12.5 **Additional SLA Metrics.**  
The Parties may agree to additional SLA Addendum Metrics (e.g., model refresh frequency, workflow deployment turnaround times) via Conforming Change Orders, which shall be subject to the same service credit framework unless otherwise agreed in writing.

---

## ARTICLE XIII  
CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  
Article XIII of the Parent Agreement (Change Management) shall apply to the Extended Program. Either Party may submit a Change Request impacting scope, Deliverables, timelines, or Fees under this Addendum.

13.2 **Impact Assessment and Change Orders.**  
The Service Provider shall provide an impact assessment in accordance with Section 13.2 of the Parent Agreement, including any impact on the Addendum Contract Value, the Addendum Term, or SLA Addendum Metrics. No change shall be effective unless documented in a Conforming Change Order executed by authorized representatives of both Parties.

13.3 **Relation to Budgetary Limits.**  
The Parties agree that no Change Order will cause the aggregate Addendum Fees to exceed the Addendum Contract Value of US$2,591,279 without explicit written agreement by both Parties. Any such increase shall also address the impact, if any, on the limitation of liability cap in Article IX.

13.4 **Continuity Pending Change Order.**  
Until a Change Order is executed, the Parties shall continue to perform their obligations under the then-current scope, consistent with Section 13.4 of the Parent Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE XIV  
DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Incorporation of Parent Agreement Mechanism.**  
Article XIV of the Parent Agreement (Dispute Resolution), including good faith negotiations, escalation, mediation under SIMC, and arbitration under SIAC, shall apply to any Dispute arising out of or in connection with this Addendum.

To the extent practical, Disputes involving both the Parent Agreement and this Addendum shall be consolidated in a single mediation and/or arbitration proceeding under the Parent Agreement’s dispute resolution mechanism, unless the Parties agree otherwise.

FORCE MAJEURE
