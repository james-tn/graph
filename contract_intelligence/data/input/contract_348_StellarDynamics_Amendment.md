9.1 **Modification of Parent Agreement’s Liability Regime.**  

9.1.1 The Parties acknowledge that **Article IX of the Parent Agreement** provides for **no contractual cap on aggregate liability** and allows recovery of consequential and other indirect damages in view of the high-risk classification in Section 2.8 of the Parent Agreement.  

9.1.2 **Solely for claims arising from or relating to this Amendment, the Extended Licensed Software, and Extended Services**, the Parties agree to modify the Parent Agreement’s risk allocation as follows, consistent with the **Low-Risk Classification**:

9.2 **Cap on Liability.**  

9.2.1 Subject to Section 9.4 below, the aggregate liability of each Party to the other for all claims, damages, and losses arising out of or relating to this Amendment (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) shall not exceed **five (5) times the total fees paid or payable by Contoso to Stellar Dynamics under this Amendment during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.

9.2.2 For clarity, the cap described in Section 9.2.1 is separate from and shall not limit any liability related solely to the Parent Agreement (excluding this Amendment), which remains governed by **Article IX of the Parent Agreement**, unless the Parties subsequently agree otherwise in writing.

9.3 **Exclusion of Consequential Damages (Client-Friendly).**  

9.3.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION 9.4, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, OR DATA), EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AMENDMENT.  

9.3.2 This Section 9.3 supersedes **Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement** only with respect to claims arising from or relating to this Amendment.

9.4 **Exceptions to Limitations.**  

The limitations and exclusions in Sections 9.2 and 9.3 shall not apply to:  
(a) a Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII** (subject to the cap in Section 9.2 unless prohibited by law);  
(b) a Party’s breach of **Article V (Confidentiality)** or **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)** as incorporated herein, to the extent such breach results from gross negligence or willful misconduct;  
(c) a Party’s violation of the other Party’s Intellectual Property Rights; or  
(d) any liability that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable law.

(a) in three (3) consecutive calendar months; or  
(b) in any four (4) months in any rolling twelve (12) month period,  
and fails to cure such repeated failures within thirty (30) days of written notice from Contoso, Contoso may terminate this Amendment (in whole or in part) upon thirty (30) days’ written notice, without penalty and without affecting its rights under the Parent Agreement for non-Extended services, consistent with but more Client-friendly than **Section 4.6 of the Parent Agreement**.
