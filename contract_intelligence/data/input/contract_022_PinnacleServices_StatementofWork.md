8.5 **Exclusions.**  
Vendor shall have no liability for any claim of infringement to the extent that it arises from: (a) modifications to the Deliverables made by or on behalf of Client (other than by Vendor); (b) combination of the Deliverables with any products, services, or materials not provided or approved by Vendor, if the claim would not have arisen but for such combination; or (c) Client’s continued use of the Deliverables after Vendor has provided a non-infringing alternative that substantially preserves the functionality.

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Laws relating to data protection, data security, and privacy, including, where applicable, the GDPR, CCPA, and similar laws. To the extent Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of Client in connection with the Services, Vendor shall act as a “processor” or “service provider” (as such terms are defined under Applicable Laws), and Client shall act as the “controller” or “business.”

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.**  
Vendor shall process Personal Data only (a) in accordance with Client’s written instructions, including this SOW and any data processing addendum agreed by the Parties; (b) for the purposes of providing the Services and performing its obligations under this SOW; and (c) in accordance with Applicable Law. Vendor shall not “sell” or “share” (as those terms are defined in the CCPA) any Personal Data.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data and Client’s Confidential Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures shall be no less protective than those Vendor uses to protect its own similar information and shall in any event meet industry-standard practices for the type and volume of data processed.

11.4 **Subprocessors.**  
Vendor may engage subcontractors or subprocessors to assist in providing the Services, provided that Vendor (a) ensures such subprocessors are bound by written agreements that impose data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this SOW; and (b) remains fully responsible for their acts and omissions.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personal Data or Client’s Confidential Information arising from Vendor’s systems or facilities (a **“Data Breach”**), Vendor shall:

  (a) Notify Client without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach, providing known details of the incident;  

  (b) Take prompt steps to contain, investigate, and remediate the Data Breach;  

  (c) Cooperate with Client’s reasonable requests for assistance in fulfilling Client’s breach notification obligations under Applicable Law; and  

  (d) Not notify any third party (including any data subject or regulator) about the Data Breach without prior coordination with Client, except where required by law.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.**  
Vendor shall promptly notify Client of any requests from data subjects seeking to exercise their rights under Applicable Law (such as access, deletion, or correction) that relate to Personal Data processed by Vendor on behalf of Client. Vendor shall not respond to such requests except on documented instructions from Client, unless required by Applicable Law.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this SOW, or upon Client’s earlier written request, Vendor shall, at Client’s option, delete or return all Personal Data and Client data in its possession or control, except to the extent Vendor is required by law to retain certain data, in which case Vendor shall continue to protect such data in accordance with this Article XI.

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)

12.1 **Scope.**  
This Article XII applies to the ongoing managed support and maintenance Services provided by Vendor, including incident management, ticket resolution, and system monitoring support.

12.2 **Availability / Uptime.**  
For any Vendor-managed components of the solution hosted or operated by Vendor, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve at least **99.9%** uptime per calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance and emergency maintenance as described in Section 12.3.

12.3 **Maintenance Windows.**  
Vendor may schedule periodic maintenance that may temporarily affect availability, provided that:

  (a) Scheduled maintenance shall be communicated to Client at least five (5) Business Days in advance; and  

  (b) Such maintenance windows shall not exceed eight (8) hours per month, and shall, to the extent practicable, occur outside of Client’s normal business hours.

Emergency maintenance may be performed without advance notice as reasonably necessary to address critical security issues or system failures, in which case Vendor shall notify Client as soon as practicable.

12.4 **Incident Classification and Response Times.**  

Incidents shall be classified as follows, with associated response and target resolution times measured during Business Hours unless otherwise specified:

  - **Severity 1 (Critical):** Complete outage or severe degradation impacting a majority of users; no workaround.  
    - Initial Response: within 1 hour  
    - Target Resolution or Workaround: within 8 hours  

  - **Severity 2 (High):** Significant functionality impaired for many users, but system is operational; workaround may exist.  
    - Initial Response: within 2 hours  
    - Target Resolution or Workaround: within 16 hours  

  - **Severity 3 (Medium):** Non-critical issue affecting limited functionality or limited number of users; workaround usually available.  
    - Initial Response: within 1 Business Day  
    - Target Resolution or Workaround: within 5 Business Days  

  - **Severity 4 (Low):** Minor issue, cosmetic defect, or general inquiry with no impact on production operations.  
    - Initial Response: within 2 Business Days  
    - Target Resolution: as mutually agreed or in next scheduled release.

12.5 **Service Credits.**  
If Vendor fails to meet the uptime commitment or the Severity 1 response/resolution SLA in any calendar month, Client may be eligible for service credits as follows:

  (a) Uptime below 99.9% but equal to or above 99.0%: 5% credit of monthly managed services Fees.  
  (b) Uptime below 99.0%: 10% credit of monthly managed services Fees.  
  (c) Failure to meet Severity 1 response/resolution SLA on more than two (2) occasions in a calendar quarter: additional 5% credit of monthly managed services Fees for that quarter.

Service credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall not be redeemable for cash. In no event shall total service credits in any calendar month exceed 20% of the managed services Fees for that month.

12.6 **Sole Remedies.**  
The Parties agree that the service credits specified in this Article XII shall be Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for Vendor’s failure to meet the Service Levels, unless such failure constitutes a material breach under Article IV or is caused by Vendor’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  
Either Party may propose changes to the scope, Deliverables, schedule, or Fees under this SOW (each a **“Change Request”**). Change Requests shall be documented in writing and submitted to the other Party’s designated project representative.

13.2 **Impact Assessment.**  
Upon receiving a Change Request from Client, Vendor shall assess the impact of the requested change on the scope, timeline, Fees, and resources and shall provide an impact assessment within a reasonable period (typically within ten (10) Business Days). Vendor may charge on a time-and-materials basis for significant effort required to analyze complex Change Requests, provided that Vendor informs Client in advance.

13.3 **Change Order Approval.**  
No Change Request shall be effective unless and until documented in a written Change Order signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. The Parties agree to act reasonably and in good faith when considering Change Requests and Change Orders.

13.4 **Effect of Change Orders.**  
Once executed, the Change Order shall become part of this SOW and shall supersede any inconsistent terms regarding the affected Services. Vendor shall be relieved from any obligation to meet originally agreed deadlines or deliverables to the extent impacted by the approved change, as reflected in the Change Order.

13.5 **Minor Changes.**  
Minor changes that do not materially impact scope, Fees, or schedule (for example, minor configuration tweaks within the existing allocation of hours) may be handled through written email approval between the Parties’ project managers, provided that such approvals are retained and referenced in project records.

---

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Informal Resolution.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this SOW or the breach thereof (a **“Dispute”**), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal discussions between the Parties’ project managers.

14.2 **Escalation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved within fifteen (15) Business Days after written notice of the Dispute is provided, either Party may escalate the Dispute to senior management (e.g., a Vice President or equivalent) of each Party.

14.3 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days after escalation to senior management, the Parties agree to submit the Dispute to non-binding mediation in **King County, Washington**, administered by a mutually agreed mediator. The costs of mediation shall be shared equally by the Parties, except that each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees.

14.4 **Litigation / Arbitration.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days from the appointment of the mediator, either Party may pursue its rights and remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in Article XVII. Nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking interim or injunctive relief in court where such relief is necessary to prevent irreparable harm.

---

## ARTICLE XV – FORCE MAJEURE

15.1 **Definition.**  
Neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this SOW (other than payment obligations) to the extent such failure or delay is caused by events beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, civil disturbances, strikes or other labor disputes (other than those involving such Party’s own employees), epidemics, pandemics, governmental orders, or failures or interruptions of utilities or telecommunications (each, a **“Force Majeure Event”**).

15.2 **Notice and Mitigation.**  
The Party affected by a Force Majeure Event shall (a) promptly notify the other Party in writing of the nature and expected duration of the Force Majeure Event, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the Force Majeure Event, and (c) resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable once the Force Majeure Event has ceased.
