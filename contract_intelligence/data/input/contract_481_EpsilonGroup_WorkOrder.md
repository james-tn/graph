8.4 **Infringement Remedies.**  
If the Work Product or Services become, or in the Service Provider’s reasonable opinion are likely to become, the subject of an infringement Claim, the Service Provider may, at its option and expense, (a) procure for the Company the right to continue using the affected Work Product or Services; (b) modify or replace the Work Product or Services to make them non-infringing while maintaining substantially equivalent functionality; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected portion of the Services and refund to the Company any prepaid, unused fees for the affected Services. This Section 8.4 sets forth the Company’s exclusive remedy for infringement Claims against the Service Provider, subject to the limitations in **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)**.
