  (b) permit the indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of the Claim, provided that the indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any liability or obligation on, or admits fault by, the indemnified Party without the indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld); and  
  (c) reasonably cooperate with the indemnifying Party at the indemnifying Party’s expense.

The indemnified Party may participate in the defense with counsel of its own choice at its own expense.

8.4 **Infringement Remedies.**  
If any Service or Deliverable is, or in Service Provider’s reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement Claim, Service Provider shall, at its expense and in consultation with Client, use commercially reasonable efforts to:  
  (a) procure for Client the right to continue using such Service or Deliverable;  
  (b) modify the Service or Deliverable so that it becomes non-infringing while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or  
  (c) replace the Service or Deliverable with a non-infringing alternative having substantially equivalent functionality.

If Service Provider cannot achieve the foregoing on commercially reasonable terms, Client may terminate the affected SOW upon written notice and Service Provider shall refund to Client any prepaid Fees for the affected Services or Deliverables on a pro rata basis.

8.5 **Exclusive Remedies.**  
The obligations of the Parties under this **Article VIII** shall be the indemnified Party’s sole and exclusive remedy for third-party Claims covered by this Article, subject to the limitation of liability in **Article IX**.

DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its performance under this Agreement.
