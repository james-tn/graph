The precise location, configuration, and square footage of the Premises shall be as depicted in **Exhibit A (Premises Description and Floor Plan)**, which may be attached hereto and incorporated by reference. In the event of any discrepancy between Exhibit A and the text of this Agreement, Exhibit A shall govern as to the physical description of the Premises.

2.2 **Use of Premises.**  
(a) Contoso shall use the Premises solely for general office, administrative, and related lawful business purposes, and for no other purpose without Cascade’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.  
(b) Contoso shall comply with all Applicable Laws, including building codes and zoning requirements, and shall not use the Premises in any manner that:  
   (i) constitutes a nuisance or unreasonably disturbs other tenants;  
   (ii) involves the handling, storage, or disposal of hazardous materials in violation of Applicable Law; or  
   (iii) increases the risk of damage to the Premises beyond normal commercial office use.

2.3 **Services Provided by Cascade.** During the Term, Cascade shall provide, either directly or through third-party contractors, the following Services in connection with the Premises:

  (a) **Building Operations and Maintenance.** Cascade shall maintain the building structure, including foundation, roof, exterior walls, structural columns, beams, and all building systems serving the Premises and other parts of the building, such as HVAC systems, elevators, plumbing, and electrical risers, in good working order, consistent with the standard of a first-class commercial building in the Greater Seattle metropolitan area.

  (b) **Janitorial and Cleaning Services.** Cascade shall provide regular janitorial services for the Premises on Business Days, including vacuuming, trash removal, dusting, and restroom cleaning where applicable. Deep cleaning, specialized sanitation, or enhanced cleaning protocols beyond building standard shall be provided at Contoso’s request and expense, unless required by Applicable Law.

  (c) **Security Services.** Cascade shall provide building-level security measures, which may include controlled access at entry points, security cameras in common areas, and after-hours access control systems. Contoso shall be responsible for the security of its own equipment, data, and internal offices within the Premises.

  (d) **Utilities.** Cascade shall provide or cause to be provided electricity, water, and HVAC service to the Premises during normal business hours (e.g., 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding recognized building holidays), in accordance with building standards. If Contoso requires after-hours HVAC or additional utility capacity (e.g., for server rooms), such services may be provided at additional cost to Contoso, as mutually agreed in writing.

  (e) **Repairs.** Cascade shall be responsible for all repairs to the building systems, structural components, and common areas, except to the extent damage is caused by the negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement by Contoso or its agents, in which case Contoso shall reimburse Cascade for the reasonable costs of repair. Contoso shall be responsible for non-structural repairs and maintenance within the Premises that are not part of Cascade’s standard building services.

  (f) **Parking and Common Areas.** If the building includes parking facilities, Cascade shall provide Contoso with access to a reasonable number of parking spaces (reserved or unreserved) as specified in **Exhibit B (Parking Allocation and Fees)**, subject to payment of any applicable parking fees. Cascade shall maintain all common areas in good repair and condition, and may implement reasonable rules and regulations governing their use.

2.4 **Contoso’s Responsibilities.**  
(a) Contoso shall keep the Premises in neat, clean, and sanitary condition, and shall promptly notify Cascade of any condition requiring repair that is the responsibility of Cascade.  
(b) Contoso shall not make structural alterations or Improvements without Cascade’s prior written consent. Non-structural alterations within the Premises that are consistent with office use and do not affect building systems may be performed by Contoso with prior written notice to Cascade and subject to compliance with Applicable Laws and building rules.  
(c) Contoso shall be responsible for the installation, maintenance, and repair of its own personal property, trade fixtures, office equipment, data systems, and cabling, subject to Cascade’s reasonable rules regarding building penetrations and system loads.

2.5 **Performance Standards.**  
Cascade shall perform the Services with commercially reasonable skill, care, and diligence, consistent with industry standards for similar buildings in the region. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

  (a) **Response Times.** For critical building issues that materially impair access or essential utilities to the Premises, Cascade shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond within four (4) hours after notification from Contoso, and to commence corrective action promptly thereafter. For non-critical issues, Cascade shall respond within two (2) Business Days.

  (b) **Preventive Maintenance.** Cascade shall implement a preventive maintenance program for building systems, including HVAC, elevators, and electrical systems serving the Premises, and shall coordinate such maintenance so as to minimize disruption to Contoso’s operations. Where feasible, such work shall be performed outside normal business hours.

  (c) **Compliance with SLAs.** To the extent specified in Article XII, Cascade shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet or exceed the Service Levels, including uptime commitments and response time targets, and shall provide remedies as set forth therein in the event of SLA failures.

2.6 **Temporary Interruptions.**  
Cascade shall be permitted to temporarily interrupt Services or access to portions of the building, including the Premises, as reasonably necessary to perform repairs, maintenance, or Improvements, or to comply with Applicable Laws, provided that:  
  (a) Cascade shall provide advance notice to Contoso, where reasonably practicable;  
  (b) Cascade shall use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule such interruptions outside normal business hours; and  
  (c) Cascade shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the duration and impact of such interruptions.  
Such temporary interruptions shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement or a constructive eviction, and shall not entitle Contoso to any abatement of Rent, except as expressly provided in the SLA in Article XII or as otherwise required by Applicable Law.

2.7 **Additional Services and Work Orders.**  
Any additional services, Improvements, or alterations requested by Contoso that are not included in Cascade’s standard building services shall be documented in a Work Order pursuant to Article XIII, specifying scope, schedule, and additional fees.

3.3 **Rent Adjustments.**  
On each anniversary of the Commencement Date during the Term, the Base Rent shall be increased by **[e.g., 3%]** over the prior year’s Base Rent, or by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the Seattle area over the preceding twelve (12) months, whichever is lower, unless otherwise agreed in writing. Cascade shall provide written notice to Contoso of the adjusted Base Rent at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such adjustment.

3.4 **Payment Terms; Net 60.**

(c) Cascade shall provide an annual statement of actual operating costs and Additional Rent, together with reasonable supporting detail. To the extent Contoso has paid more than its actual share, Cascade shall credit the overage to Contoso’s next installment(s) of Rent; to the extent there is a shortfall, Contoso shall pay the difference within sixty (60) days of receipt of the statement.

3.6 **Expenses and Reimbursement.**

(c) Such reimbursable expenses shall be invoiced in arrears and shall be payable in accordance with the Net 60 terms set forth in Section 3.4.

3.7 **Late Payment; Interest.**  
(a) Any undisputed amount not paid by Contoso within the applicable Net 60 period shall be deemed past due. Cascade may charge interest on such past-due amounts at the lesser of:  
   (i) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or  
   (ii) the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law,  
calculated from the day following the due date until the date of actual payment.  
(b) The charging of interest shall not limit Cascade’s other rights and remedies under this Agreement or at law.

3.9 **Taxes on Rent.**  
Contoso shall be responsible for any sales, use, occupancy, or similar taxes imposed on Rent or services under this Agreement (excluding taxes based on Cascade’s net income), which shall be added to Cascade’s invoices and paid by Contoso in accordance with the Net 60 terms.

3.10 **No Setoff.**  
Except as expressly permitted under this Agreement or with Cascade’s prior written consent, Contoso shall not set off or withhold any amounts from Rent or other fees due under this Agreement based on any alleged claim, counterclaim, or right of setoff against Cascade, without prejudice to Contoso’s right to seek recovery through the dispute resolution procedures in Article XIV.

(b) permit the Indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of the Claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent if such settlement imposes any non-monetary obligation on the Indemnified Party or admits liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party; and  
(c) cooperate reasonably with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defense of the Claim.

8.4 **Exclusive Remedies.**  
The indemnification obligations under this Article VIII, together with any rights under Article IX (Limitation of Liability), shall constitute the Parties’ exclusive remedies for third-party claims covered by this Article, except to the extent a Party is entitled to equitable relief.

The calculation and amount of any service credit shall be mutually agreed, acting reasonably, and shall not exceed **10% of the monthly Base Rent** for the subject month.

12.5 **Exclusive SLA Remedies.**

(c) any desired timelines or constraints.

All approved changes that increase Cascade’s costs or require additional Services shall entitle Cascade to equitable adjustments in Fees, timelines, and Service Levels as set forth in the applicable Work Order.
