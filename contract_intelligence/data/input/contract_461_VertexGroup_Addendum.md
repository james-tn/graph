Rent for the applicable Additional Premises shall commence on the Expansion Commencement Date, not earlier.

(c) **Approvals.** Vertex shall submit preliminary plans and specifications for Tenant Improvements for the Additional Premises to Contoso for written approval, consistent with **Section 2.3(c)** of the Parent Agreement.

The Services described in **Section 2.4** of the Parent Agreement (Building Operations and Maintenance, Utilities, Janitorial Services, Security, IT and Connectivity Services, Parking, and Ancillary Services) shall be extended to the Additional Premises on substantially the same terms, subject to the following clarifications:

(c) **Parking Allocation.** Vertex shall use commercially reasonable efforts to increase the allocation of parking spaces for Contoso’s personnel commensurate with the increased rentable area, at market rates.

(d) **Relationship to Parent Agreement.** The Base Rent (Addendum) set forth herein is **separate from, and in addition to**, the Base Rent obligations for the Original Premises under **Section 3.2** of the Parent Agreement.

3.3 **Additional Rent and Service Fees (Addendum).**  
(a) **Operating Expenses Allocation.** Contoso shall pay as Additional Rent its proportionate share of Building operating expenses attributable to the Aggregate Premises, calculated using Vertex’s standard methodology described in **Section 3.3(a)** of the Parent Agreement. The proportionate share will increase commensurate with the increase in rentable square footage.

(b) **Incremental Service Fees.** Fees for optional or incremental services requested by Contoso for the Additional Premises (e.g., enhanced security, dedicated bandwidth, additional cleaning beyond Building standard, specialized IT services) shall be charged at rates mutually agreed in writing. Vertex may adjust such fees to reflect market conditions upon at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, provided that any increase during the Addendum Term shall be reasonable and in line with comparable services in the San Francisco market.

(c) **Shared Improvement Costs.** Contoso shall reimburse Vertex for Contoso‑approved, non‑standard Tenant Improvements in the Additional Premises (including Suite 710 and Suite 820), as well as its allocable share of any common support area upgrades requested by Contoso. Such costs shall be invoiced either as one‑time charges or, if mutually agreed, amortized over the remaining Addendum Term.

3.4 **Payment Terms; Net 45.**  
(a) **Invoices.** Vertex shall invoice Contoso monthly in advance for Base Rent (Addendum), estimated Additional Rent, and recurring Service Fees associated with the Additional Premises. One‑time charges and reimbursable expenses shall be invoiced monthly in arrears with reasonably detailed supporting documentation.

The Parent Agreement’s Net 60 terms shall continue to apply to amounts due solely under the Parent Agreement, unless the Parties agree otherwise in writing.

(c) **Disputed Amounts.** Contoso may withhold payment of any portion of an invoice that it reasonably and in good faith disputes, provided that Contoso: (i) pays all undisputed amounts by the due date; (ii) notifies Vertex in writing within fifteen (15) days of the invoice date identifying the disputed items and reasons; and (iii) cooperates in good faith to resolve such dispute. Nonpayment of disputed amounts in accordance with this Section shall not constitute a default under this Addendum.

3.5 **Late Payment; Interest.**  
For undisputed amounts owing under this Addendum, any amount not received by the due date shall accrue interest from the due date until paid at the lesser of (a) **one and one‑half percent (1.5%) per month**, or (b) the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law, consistent with but not limited by **Section 3.5** of the Parent Agreement. Vertex shall provide written notice of late payment prior to imposing late fees or interest and may, upon ten (10) days’ additional written notice, suspend non‑essential Services for continued non‑payment, without prejudicing any other remedies.

3.6 **Taxes; Withholding.**  
The tax provisions in **Section 3.7** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to all payments under this Addendum. Contoso shall be responsible for any sales, use, value‑added, or similar taxes imposed on the Addendum Rent or Services provided hereunder, excluding taxes based on Vertex’s net income.

3.7 **Expenses and Reimbursement.**  
The reimbursement provisions in **Section 3.8** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to this Addendum. In particular, Contoso shall reimburse Vertex only for pre‑approved out‑of‑pocket expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred in connection with (a) non‑standard Tenant Improvements for the Additional Premises, and (b) extraordinary services requested specifically by Contoso, in each case supported by documentation.

(a) **No Aggregate Cap for Vertex.** Vertex’s total aggregate liability to Contoso for claims arising under this Addendum shall **not be subject to the monetary cap in Section 9.2** of the Parent Agreement and shall instead be determined in accordance with Applicable Law, taking into account the Addendum Contract Value and risk allocation agreed herein; and

(b) **No Aggregate Cap for Contoso.** Contoso’s total aggregate liability to Vertex for claims arising under this Addendum shall likewise **not be subject to any contractual aggregate cap** and shall be determined under Applicable Law.

9.2 **Types of Damages.**  
The exclusion of certain damages in **Section 9.1** of the Parent Agreement is hereby **modified** solely for purposes of this Addendum as follows:

(a) **Consequential and Special Damages Permitted.** Each Party may recover **consequential, incidental, and special damages** from the other Party to the extent such damages are reasonably foreseeable and directly arise out of the other Party’s material breach of this Addendum or gross negligence or willful misconduct, subject to Applicable Law.

(b) **Punitive Damages.** The exclusion of punitive or exemplary damages in Section 9.1 of the Parent Agreement shall continue to apply unless such damages are mandated by statute and may not be waived.

9.3 **Exceptions and Risk Allocation.**  
The specific exceptions in **Section 9.3** of the Parent Agreement (indemnification, gross negligence/willful misconduct, confidentiality breaches, IP infringement) shall continue to apply; provided that, because this Addendum is designated as a **High Risk Engagement**, such exceptions are **not further limited by any aggregate cap**.

9.4 **Risk Allocation Acknowledgement.**  
The Parties acknowledge that:

(a) The removal of liability caps and partial removal of damage exclusions for this Addendum have been specifically negotiated in light of the **Addendum Contract Value of US $4,190,695**, the nature of the Additional Premises, and the expanded Services; and
