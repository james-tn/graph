## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **No Cap (High‑Risk, Vendor‑Favorable).**  
In recognition of the high‑risk nature of this Agreement and the mutual expectations of the Parties, **there shall be no contractual cap on the liability of either Party** under this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise. The Parties acknowledge that this allocation of risk has been factored into the pricing and risk management strategies of both Parties.

9.2 **Consequential and Other Damages (Permitted for High Risk).**  
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Parties agree that:

  a. **Neither Party shall be excluded** from recovering consequential, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or indirect damages; and  
  b. Without limitation, the following categories of loss shall be recoverable if proven: loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of savings, loss of data, loss of goodwill, business interruption, and loss of opportunity.

9.3 **Allocation of Risk.**  
The Parties acknowledge and agree that:

  a. the Services are highly complex and involve integration of multiple third‑party technologies and data sources;  
  b. the absence of a liability cap and the inclusion of consequential damages, as set forth in this Article IX, are deliberate negotiated terms reflecting the high‑risk classification and Vendor‑favorable nature of this Agreement; and  
  c. each Party has had the opportunity to consult legal and financial advisors regarding this allocation of risk.
