(c) Client shall notify Vendor in writing within the Acceptance Period (i) of its acceptance of the Deliverable, or (ii) of any material non-conformities with the specifications, together with reasonable details.

If, after at least two (2) correction attempts, the Deliverable still fails to materially conform to the specifications, Client may, as its sole and exclusive remedies: (A) accept the Deliverable “as-is” with a mutually agreed reduction in fees; or (B) reject the Deliverable and terminate the relevant portion of the SOW pursuant to Article IV (subject to any applicable cure rights) and receive a refund of amounts paid for the non-conforming Deliverable.

Vendor may use subcontractors to perform portions of the Services, provided that: (a) Vendor remains fully responsible and liable for the acts and omissions of its subcontractors; (b) any subcontractor engaged in processing Client’s Confidential Information or Personal Data is bound by confidentiality and data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement; and (c) Vendor shall not subcontract to any entity that is a direct competitor of Client without Client’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).
