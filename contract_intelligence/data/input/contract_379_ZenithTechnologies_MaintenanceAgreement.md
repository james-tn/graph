12.1 **Relationship to Parent Agreement SLAs.**  

The Service Levels in **Article XII of the Parent Agreement** (including 99.9% average monthly uptime and severity-based response times) remain in effect and are hereby adopted for the Maintenance Term, **as supplemented by the more detailed provisions** of this Article XII. To the extent of any inconsistency, the more specific provisions of this Article XII shall control for Maintenance Services.

12.2 **Service Availability.**  

Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide an uninterrupted operation of the Hosted components of the Covered Software with a **monthly uptime of 99.9%**, measured over each calendar month, excluding **Permitted Downtime** as defined in Section 12.2 of the Parent Agreement and which includes Planned Maintenance, Emergency Maintenance, Client-caused downtime, Force Majeure Events, and misuse of the Software.

The following severity levels and target times shall apply:

(a) **Severity 1 – Critical**  
- Definition: Production system outage or severe degradation preventing all or a majority of users from accessing core functionality, with no workaround.  
- Target Initial Response Time: within **1 hour**, 24x7 (consistent with Parent Agreement).  
- Target Resolution Time: Vendor will work continuously (24x7) and use commercially reasonable efforts to implement a workaround or correction within **8 hours** of initial response.

(b) **Severity 2 – High**  
- Definition: Significant impact on critical functionality or business processes; system remains operational but with severely impaired features and no acceptable workaround.  
- Target Initial Response Time: within **4 Business Hours**.  
- Target Resolution Time: within **2 Business Days**, subject to complexity; Vendor will provide interim mitigation where a permanent fix is not immediately feasible.

(c) **Severity 3 – Medium**  
- Definition: Moderate impact on non-critical functionality, with an available workaround.  
- Target Initial Response Time: within **1 Business Day**.  
- Target Resolution Time: within **10 Business Days**, or inclusion in the next scheduled maintenance release, whichever occurs earlier.

(b) number of Incidents by severity; and  

(c) compliance with the Response and Resolution Time targets.

12.5 **Remedies for SLA Failures – Service Credits.**  

(a) **Availability Credits.** If Vendor fails to achieve the 99.9% uptime target (excluding Permitted Downtime) in a given calendar month, Client shall be entitled to service credits as specified in **Section 12.4 of the Parent Agreement** (5%, 10%, or 20% of the monthly subscription fee depending on uptime). For purposes of this Maintenance Agreement, the “monthly subscription fee” shall be deemed to include the pro-rated monthly portion of the Maintenance and Support Fees.  

(b) **Response/Resolution Credits.** If Vendor repeatedly fails to meet Response or Resolution Time targets for Severity 1 and 2 Incidents in a given quarter (three (3) or more failures), the Parties shall meet in good faith to discuss corrective actions. If such failures continue for two (2) consecutive quarters, Client shall be entitled to an additional service credit equal to **5% of the quarterly Maintenance and Support Fees** for each quarter in which such repeat failures occur.

(c) Service credits are Client’s **sole and exclusive monetary remedy** for SLA failures under this Maintenance Agreement, without prejudice to any non-monetary remedies or termination rights under Article IV.

12.6 **Exclusions.**  

No SLA Credits shall be due, and Vendor shall not be deemed in breach of Service Levels, where the failure results from:  

(a) any cause constituting Permitted Downtime under Section 12.2 of the Parent Agreement;  

(b) Client’s failure to comply with the Parent Agreement or this Maintenance Agreement;  

(c) Client’s failure to implement recommended Updates or patches designated as critical; or
