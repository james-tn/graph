## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY  

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Amendment. To the extent Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of Client, Vendor shall act as a “processor” or “service provider” (as such terms are defined under applicable Data Protection Laws), and Client shall act as a “controller” or “business.”

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.** Vendor shall process Personal Data solely on behalf of and in accordance with Client’s documented instructions as set forth in this Amendment and any applicable SOWs. Vendor shall not sell Personal Data or retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the Services under this Amendment or as otherwise permitted by Data Protection Laws.

11.3 **Security Measures.** Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures shall be consistent with industry best practices and commensurate with the nature of the Personal Data and the risks involved.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event Vendor becomes aware of any unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personal Data in Vendor’s possession or control (a **“Data Breach”**), Vendor shall: (a) notify Client without undue delay and, in any event, no later than seventy-two (72) hours after confirming the Data Breach; (b) provide Client with information reasonably sufficient to enable Client to comply with its obligations under Data Protection Laws; (c) take commercially reasonable steps to contain, investigate, and remediate the Data Breach; and (d) cooperate with Client in any legally required notifications to affected individuals or governmental authorities.

11.5 **Subprocessors.** Vendor may engage subprocessors to process Personal Data on its behalf, provided that Vendor (a) imposes on such subprocessors data protection obligations that are at least as protective as those set forth in this Amendment; and (b) remains fully responsible for the subprocessors’ acts and omissions as if they were Vendor’s own. Upon Client’s request, Vendor shall provide a list of subprocessors that process Personal Data on behalf of Client.

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by applicable law. Upon termination or expiration of this Amendment, or upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall delete or return Personal Data (at Client’s option), except to the extent retention is required by law or for legitimate business purposes such as the defense of legal claims, in which case Vendor shall continue to protect such data in accordance with this Amendment.

11.7 **Data Subject Requests.** Vendor shall promptly (and in any event within a timeframe that enables Client to meet its legal obligations) notify Client of any request received from a data subject or consumer relating to Personal Data (e.g., requests for access, deletion, correction, or restriction). Vendor shall not respond directly to such requests except as instructed by Client or where legally required. Vendor shall provide reasonable assistance to Client in responding to such requests.

11.8 **International Transfers.** To the extent Vendor transfers Personal Data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions with data transfer restrictions to a country that has not been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, the Parties shall enter into appropriate data transfer mechanisms (such as the Standard Contractual Clauses or other lawful transfer tools) as required by Data Protection Laws.

12.1 **Uptime Commitment.** For any hosted or platform-based components of the Services provided by Vendor, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the platform is available at least **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance and any unavailability caused by (a) Client’s systems or networks; (b) third-party services not under Vendor’s control; or (c) Force Majeure Events.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.** Vendor may perform scheduled maintenance during standard maintenance windows as specified in the applicable SOW. Vendor shall provide reasonable advance notice (not less than forty-eight (48) hours) for any scheduled maintenance expected to cause a material disruption of the Services.

12.3 **Response and Resolution Times.** Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to adhere to the following initial response and target resolution times for support incidents, measured from the time Vendor receives notice of the incident:

  - **Severity 1 (Critical)** – Complete outage or severe impact on critical business operations: initial response within 1 hour; target resolution or workaround within 8 hours.  
  - **Severity 2 (High)** – Significant degradation with no feasible workaround: initial response within 2 hours; target resolution or workaround within 24 hours.  
  - **Severity 3 (Medium)** – Partial degradation or impact with workaround available: initial response within 4 business hours; target resolution or workaround within 3 Business Days.  
  - **Severity 4 (Low)** – Minor issues or general questions: initial response within 1 Business Day; resolution as mutually agreed.

12.4 **Service Credits.** If the monthly uptime percentage falls below the 99.9% target or Vendor fails to meet the specified response times for Severity 1 incidents on more than two (2) occasions in a calendar quarter, Client shall be entitled to service credits as follows (unless otherwise provided in an SOW):

  (a) Uptime between 99.0% and 99.89%: credit equal to 5% of the monthly Fees for the affected Services.  

  (b) Uptime between 98.0% and 98.99%: credit equal to 10% of the monthly Fees for the affected Services.  

  (c) Uptime below 98.0%: credit equal to 20% of the monthly Fees for the affected Services.

Service credits shall be applied to the next invoice(s) issued by Vendor and shall not be redeemable for cash. Service credits are Client’s exclusive remedy for Service Level failures, except where such failures constitute a material breach under Section 4.3.2.

12.5 **Exclusions.** Service Levels do not apply to any issues arising from: (a) misuse of the Services by Client; (b) use of the Services in combination with products or services not supplied or approved by Vendor; (c) unauthorized modifications made by Client or third parties; or (d) outages resulting from Force Majeure Events.

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT  

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may propose changes to the scope, schedule, Service Levels, or Fees relating to the Services governed by this Amendment (each, a **“Change Request”**). All Change Requests shall be documented in writing and contain sufficient detail to enable the other Party to evaluate the proposed change.

13.2 **Impact Analysis.** Upon receipt of a Change Request, the receiving Party shall, within a reasonable period, evaluate the request and provide an impact analysis describing: (a) the technical and functional implications of the proposed change; (b) any impact on schedule or milestones; (c) any impact on Fees or costs; and (d) any other relevant considerations.

13.3 **Approval of Change Orders.** No Change Request shall be binding unless and until the Parties execute a Change Order documenting the agreed changes and referencing this Amendment. Once executed, each Change Order shall form part of this Amendment and shall supersede any conflicting provisions in prior documentation concerning the subject matter of the change.

13.4 **Continuity of Services.** Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Vendor shall continue to perform the Services in accordance with the existing terms while the Parties evaluate any Change Request, and Client shall continue to pay undisputed Fees in accordance with this Amendment.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION  

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.** In the event of any Dispute arising out of or relating to this Amendment, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiations between senior business representatives. Either Party may initiate such negotiations by providing written notice of the Dispute to the other Party.

14.2 **Escalation.** If the Dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days after such notice, the Dispute shall be escalated to a senior executive of each Party (e.g., Vice President or higher) who shall meet (in person or virtually) and attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute within an additional thirty (30) days.

14.3 **Mediation.** If the Dispute remains unresolved after the escalation period, the Parties agree to attempt to resolve the Dispute through non-binding mediation conducted in San Francisco, California, administered by a mutually agreed mediator, before resorting to arbitration or litigation. Each Party shall bear its own costs in connection with the mediation, and the Parties shall share equally the mediator’s fees.

14.4 **Arbitration or Litigation.** If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through mediation within sixty (60) days after the appointment of the mediator, then, unless the Parties agree otherwise in writing, any unresolved Dispute shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect. The arbitration shall take place in San Francisco, California, before a single arbitrator experienced in commercial contracts and technology services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm, including but not limited to unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information or Intellectual Property, pending final resolution of the Dispute in accordance with this Article XIV.
