11.4 **Security Measures.** The Service Provider shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures shall be appropriate to the nature of the Personal Data and the risks involved in its processing and shall be consistent with industry standards for similar services.

11.5 **Subprocessors.** The Service Provider may engage subcontractors who process Personal Data (“**Subprocessors**”) in connection with the Services, provided that:
