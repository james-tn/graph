## ARTICLE II  
## SCOPE OF SERVICES / WORK (EXTENSION)

2.1 **Relationship to Original SOW and Parent Agreement.**

2.1.1 This Amendment is executed **under, pursuant to, and as a modification of** the Original SOW **SOW-HOR-202406-212 (contract_212)**, which itself is executed pursuant to the Parent Agreement **CSA-HOR-202406-206 (contract_206)**. In accordance with **Section 2.1** and **Section 2.2** of the Original SOW, the Extension Services constitute an additional, defined scope of work under the same overarching Enterprise Value Acceleration Program.

2.1.2 The general categories of Services described in **Section 2.1(a)–(g)** of the Parent Agreement (strategic advisory, technology consulting, analytics, process optimization, program management, training, and related services), as further instantiated in **Article II** of the Original SOW, apply equally to the Extension Services, except as expressly modified herein.

2.2 **Overall Objective of Extension Services.**

2.2.1 The Extension Services are designed to build upon the foundational assessments, roadmaps, and implementation support provided under **Phases 1–4** of the Original SOW (Sections **2.3.1–2.3.4**), with a focus on:

(a) Accelerating **benefits realization** tied to the business case and benefits framework described in **Section 2.5(e)** (Business Case and Benefits Realization Framework) of the Original SOW;

(c) Institutionalizing **portfolio governance** and **initiative prioritization** mechanisms that extend the Project Steering Committee’s responsibilities described in **Section 2.8** of the Original SOW; and  

(d) Providing **extended optimization and continuous improvement** support that complements and extends **Phase 4 – Optimization & Knowledge Transfer** (Original SOW Section 2.3.4) into a structured program running through the Amendment Expiration Date.

2.2.2 The Extension Services are categorized as **medium risk** given their closer linkage to operational decision‑making and value realization tracking, and this is reflected in the modified risk allocation in **Article IX** of this Amendment.

Without limiting the Services described in **Article II** of the Original SOW, the Extension Services shall include:

(b) Tracks realization of financial and non‑financial benefits across at least **twelve (12)** initiatives identified under Phase 2 of the Original SOW, including metrics for revenue growth, margin improvement, productivity, and customer experience;  

(c) Establishes standard processes and templates for benefits hypothesis definition, baseline capture, ongoing measurement, and variance analysis; and

(d) Provide targeted advisory Services to internal data teams to accelerate adoption and reuse of Horizon’s frameworks and best practices.

2.3.3 **Portfolio Governance and Prioritization Support.**  
In connection with the Project Steering Committee obligations in Original SOW **Section 2.8**:

(a) Horizon shall design and maintain an **initiative portfolio prioritization engine** that scores and ranks initiatives based on value, risk, complexity, and strategic alignment;  

(b) Horizon shall facilitate quarterly portfolio review meetings, preparing materials, options, and recommendations for approvals and Change Orders, consistent with **Article XIII (Change Management)** of the Original SOW;  

(c) Horizon shall advise on trade‑offs between in‑flight and new initiatives, including any required Amendment Change Requests to address adjustments in scope, timeline, or resource levels.

Horizon shall continue to provide program management and PMO support for the Extension Services in alignment with the PMO operating guidelines and toolkit described in Original SOW **Section 2.5(f)**, including:

(a) Integrated timeline management covering both Original SOW milestones (M1–M6 in Section 2.4) and Amendment Milestones defined in Section 2.5 below;  

(b) Risk, issue, and dependency management, including tracking dependencies requiring Client action under **Section 2.9** of the Original SOW;
