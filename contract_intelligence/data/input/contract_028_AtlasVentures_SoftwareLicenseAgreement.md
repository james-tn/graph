9.1 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA (SUBJECT TO ATLAS’S OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE XI), GOODWILL, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR SUCH DAMAGES WERE OTHERWISE FORESEEABLE.

9.2 **Liability Cap.** EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS (DEFINED BELOW), IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THREE (3) TIMES THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CONTOSO TO ATLAS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

9.3 **Excluded Claims.** The limitations in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 shall not apply to: (a) a Party’s indemnification obligations under Article VIII; (b) a Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under Article V; (c) a Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (d) Contoso’s payment obligations for Fees actually due under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Atlas’s liability for data breaches shall remain subject to the cap in Section 9.2, unless such breach arises from Atlas’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.** The Parties acknowledge that the Fees and the terms of this Agreement reflect the allocation of risk set forth herein, and that the limitations and exclusions of liability are an essential basis of the bargain between the Parties.

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its performance of this Agreement. To the extent that Atlas processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso, Atlas shall do so solely as a “processor” (or equivalent term under applicable law) acting on documented instructions from Contoso, the “controller.”

11.2 **Data Processing.**  

(a) Atlas shall process Personal Data solely for the purposes of providing the Services, operating the Software and Cloud Services, performing its obligations under this Agreement, and as otherwise documented in writing by Contoso.

(b) Atlas shall not sell, share, or otherwise disclose Personal Data for monetary or other valuable consideration, except as expressly authorized by Contoso or required by law.

(c) Atlas shall ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data are bound by appropriate confidentiality obligations.

11.3 **Security Measures.** Atlas shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, taking into account the nature of the data and the risks presented by processing, and consistent with industry standards.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Atlas may engage third‑party subprocessors to process Personal Data on its behalf, provided that Atlas: (a) ensures such subprocessors are bound by written agreements that impose data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement; and (b) remains fully responsible for the acts and omissions of such subprocessors. Upon request, Atlas shall provide Contoso with a list of current subprocessors.

11.5 **Cross‑Border Transfers.** To the extent Personal Data is transferred from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions with data transfer restrictions to a country that does not provide an adequate level of protection, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses or other mechanisms approved under applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.6 **Data Subject Requests.** Atlas shall, taking into account the nature of the processing, provide reasonable assistance to Contoso in responding to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., access, rectification, erasure, and data portability). Contoso shall be responsible for responding to such requests and for determining the applicable response.

11.7 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a confirmed breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data processed by Atlas on behalf of Contoso (“**Data Breach**”), Atlas shall: (a) without undue delay and, where feasible, within seventy‑two (72) hours of becoming aware of the Data Breach, notify Contoso of the Data Breach; (b) provide Contoso with reasonable information regarding the nature and scope of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records affected, and the likely consequences; and (c) take appropriate measures to investigate, mitigate, and remediate the Data Breach. Contoso shall be responsible for determining whether to notify affected individuals or regulators, except to the extent required by law for Atlas to notify directly.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Atlas shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes of processing under this Agreement or as required by law. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or upon Contoso’s written request, Atlas shall delete or return Personal Data in accordance with Section 4.5(b), except where retention is required by law. Any retained Personal Data shall remain subject to the obligations of this Article XI.

11.9 **Audit and Compliance.** Upon reasonable prior written notice and subject to appropriate confidentiality safeguards, Contoso (or its designated auditor) may audit Atlas’s compliance with this Article XI no more than once annually, during normal business hours, and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with Atlas’s business operations. Atlas may satisfy this obligation by providing third‑party audit reports or certifications (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001) that demonstrate compliance with relevant data protection and security controls.

  - Initial response: within 2 Business Days  
  - Resolution: as agreed in the normal course of business

12.5 **Service Credits.**  

(a) If Atlas fails to meet the Service Level in any calendar month (other than due to Permitted Downtime), Contoso shall be entitled to a service credit, calculated as a percentage of the monthly subscription Fees for the affected Cloud Services for that month, according to the table below (example schedule):

- Uptime < 99.9% but ≥ 99.5%: 5% credit  
- Uptime < 99.5% but ≥ 99.0%: 10% credit  
- Uptime < 99.0%: 20% credit

(b) Service credits shall be applied against the next invoice(s) issued to Contoso. Service credits may not be redeemed for cash and shall not exceed 20% of the monthly subscription Fees for the affected month.

14.4 **Litigation.** If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days of the appointment of the mediator, either Party may pursue its rights and remedies in court, subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

14.5 **Venue; Jurisdiction.** Subject to the foregoing, any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in New York County, New York, and each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

15.2 **Effect of Force Majeure.** Neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement (other than payment obligations) to the extent such failure or delay is caused by a Force Majeure Event, provided that the affected Party: (a) uses commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the Force Majeure Event and resume performance; and (b) complies with the notice obligations in Section 15.3.
