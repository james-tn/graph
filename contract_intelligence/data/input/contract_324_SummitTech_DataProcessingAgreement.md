## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Role of the Parties.**  
For the purposes of Data Protection Laws, Contoso is the Controller and Summit Tech is the processor (or service provider) with respect to the Personal Data processed under this Agreement.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.**  
Summit Tech shall Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, including with respect to transfers to a third country, unless required to do so by Applicable Law, in which case Summit Tech shall inform Contoso of that legal requirement before Processing, unless prohibited by law.

11.3 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with its obligations under Data Protection Laws. Summit Tech shall provide reasonable assistance to Contoso in meeting Contoso’s obligations under Data Protection Laws, including with respect to data subject rights, security, Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), and consultations with supervisory authorities.

11.4 **Security Measures.**  
Summit Tech shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, where appropriate:

  a. Pseudonymization and encryption of Personal Data;  

  b. Measures to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services;  

  c. Measures for timely restoration of availability and access to Personal Data in the event of a physical or technical incident; and  

  d. Processes for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures.

Summit Tech shall document such measures and make them available to Contoso upon reasonable request.

11.5 **Personnel and Confidentiality.**  
Summit Tech shall ensure that persons authorized to Process Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality and receive appropriate data protection and security training.

11.6 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed Data Breach affecting Personal Data Processed under this Agreement, Summit Tech shall:

  a. Notify Contoso without undue delay and, where feasible, no later than forty-eight (48) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  

  b. Provide Contoso with information reasonably required to enable Contoso to comply with its legal obligations, including a description of the nature of the breach, the categories and approximate number of Data Subjects and records concerned, likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to address the breach; and  

  c. Cooperate reasonably with Contoso in investigating and mitigating the Data Breach, including assisting with any notifications to supervisory authorities or Data Subjects required under Data Protection Laws.

11.7 **Data Subject Rights.**  
Summit Tech shall, taking into account the nature of Processing, assist Contoso by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as possible, in fulfilling Contoso’s obligations to respond to requests from Data Subjects exercising their rights under Data Protection Laws (including rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection). Summit Tech shall promptly forward to Contoso any request received directly from a Data Subject relating to Personal Data Processed on behalf of Contoso.

11.8 **Sub-processors.**  
Contoso hereby grants Summit Tech general authorization to engage Sub-processors for the Processing of Personal Data, provided that:

  a. Summit Tech enters into a written agreement with each Sub-processor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those in this Agreement;  

  b. Summit Tech remains fully liable to Contoso for the performance of each Sub-processor’s obligations; and  

  c. Summit Tech provides Contoso with a list of current Sub-processors upon request and notifies Contoso in advance of any intended changes to such list. Contoso may object on reasonable data protection grounds within fifteen (15) days of such notice; if the Parties cannot resolve the objection, Contoso may terminate the affected Services on thirty (30) days’ written notice.

11.9 **International Transfers.**  
To the extent Summit Tech Processes Personal Data subject to the UK GDPR or EU GDPR in a country outside the UK or EEA that does not provide an adequate level of protection, Summit Tech shall ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent transfer mechanisms. The Parties shall execute any additional documentation required to legitimize such transfers.

11.10 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Summit Tech shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services and fulfill its obligations under this Agreement or as required by Applicable Law. Upon Contoso’s request or as set out in Section 4.6, Summit Tech shall return and/or delete Personal Data in accordance with Contoso’s instructions, subject to legal retention obligations.

11.11 **Aggregated and Anonymized Data.**  
Summit Tech may generate and use aggregated and anonymized data derived from the Processing of Personal Data, provided that such data does not identify or relate to an identifiable individual. Such aggregated or anonymized data shall not be considered Personal Data and may be used by Summit Tech for analytics, benchmarking, and improving its services, subject to confidentiality obligations.

11.12 **Audit Rights.**  
Upon at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice and no more than once per twelve (12) month period (unless required by a supervisory authority), Contoso or its appointed independent auditors may conduct audits (including inspections) of Summit Tech’s data processing facilities and practices relevant to Personal Data to verify compliance with this Article XI, provided that:

  a. Audits shall be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner that does not unreasonably disrupt Summit Tech’s operations;  

  b. Auditors shall be bound by reasonable confidentiality obligations; and  

  c. Contoso shall bear all costs associated with the audit. Summit Tech may instead provide relevant third-party audit reports (such as ISO 27001 certifications or SOC 2 reports) to satisfy these audit rights, where appropriate.

11.13 **CCPA/CPRA Obligations.**  
Where the CCPA/CPRA applies, Summit Tech acts as a “service provider” or “contractor” with respect to Personal Data and shall:

  a. Not “sell” or “share” Personal Data (as those terms are defined by the CCPA/CPRA);  

  b. Not retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the Services or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA/CPRA; and  

  c. Certify its understanding of and compliance with these restrictions.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  
Summit Tech may perform scheduled maintenance that may affect availability, provided that:

  a. Summit Tech gives Contoso at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior notice of scheduled maintenance expected to cause material downtime; and

  - **Severity 2 (High)** – Major functionality impaired with no workaround: initial response within four (4) hours;  
  - **Severity 3 (Medium)** – Non-critical functionality impaired with workaround: initial response within one (1) Business Day;

12.5 **Exclusions.**  
The SLA does not apply to any unavailability or performance issues caused by: (a) Contoso’s or its users’ actions or omissions; (b) failure of Contoso’s internet connectivity or systems; (c) factors outside Summit Tech’s reasonable control (including Force Majeure Events); or (d) use of the Services in a manner not authorized by this Agreement.

13.2 **Evaluation and Approval.**

The mediation shall be conducted in English, and the Parties shall share the mediator’s fees equally.

14.4 **Jurisdiction and Venue.**
