Delta shall not engage any sub‑processor to process Personal Data without Contoso’s prior written consent (which may be given generally in an SOW).

Service credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall not be redeemable for cash. The aggregate service credits in any month shall not exceed **30%** of the monthly support Fees.

12.5 **Chronic SLA Failures.**  
If Delta fails to achieve the Monthly Uptime Percentage or other critical Service Levels for three (3) consecutive months, or for any four (4) months in any rolling twelve (12)‑month period, such failures shall constitute a material breach, entitling Contoso to exercise its rights under Section 4.4, including termination for cause.
