DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.**  
The Parties acknowledge that, with respect to Personal Data processed in connection with the Services, Contoso is generally the “data controller” or “business” and Horizon is the “data processor” or “service provider” under applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.2 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with the performance of this Agreement. Horizon shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, including as set forth in this Agreement and any data processing addendum executed by the Parties, except where required by law.

11.4 **Subprocessors.**  
Horizon may engage third-party subprocessors to process Personal Data on its behalf, provided that: (a) Horizon imposes data protection obligations on such subprocessors that are no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement; and (b) Horizon remains fully liable for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of any actual or suspected unauthorized access to or acquisition, disclosure, or use of Personal Data in Horizon’s possession or control (a “**Data Breach**”), Horizon shall:

11.6 **Data Subject Requests.**  
Horizon shall promptly notify Contoso if it receives any request from a data subject relating to Personal Data for which Contoso is the controller (e.g., requests to access, rectify, or delete Personal Data). Horizon shall not respond to such requests except on Contoso’s documented instructions, unless required by law.

11.7 **Cross-Border Transfers.**  
To the extent Horizon transfers Personal Data from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions with data transfer restrictions to a country that does not provide an adequate level of protection under applicable Data Protection Laws, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards, such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses or other mechanisms recognized by the relevant authority.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Horizon shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes of the Services or as required by law.

## ARTICLE XII  
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **General.**  
Horizon shall provide the Services in accordance with the Service Levels set forth in this Article XII. Failure to meet a Service Level may entitle Contoso to Service Credits as described in Section 12.5, which shall be Contoso’s exclusive monetary remedy for such failures, subject to Article IX.

12.2 **Uptime Commitment.**

12.2.1 Horizon shall provide an Uptime Commitment of **99.9%** for the production environment of the hosted Services on a 24x7 basis, measured monthly, excluding Excused Downtime (defined below).

12.2.2 “**Uptime**” is calculated as follows for each month:  
Uptime % = (Total Minutes in Month – Unscheduled Downtime – Excused Downtime) ÷ (Total Minutes in Month – Excused Downtime) × 100.

12.2.3 “**Excused Downtime**” means downtime caused by: (a) scheduled maintenance within the Maintenance Window; (b) force majeure events under Article XV; (c) failures or issues caused by Contoso’s systems, networks, or third-party providers not under Horizon’s control; or (d) Contoso’s misuse of the Services in violation of this Agreement.

  • Initial Response: within 1 hour of Incident report (24x7)  
  • Target Resolution / Workaround: within 8 hours of initial response

  • Initial Response: within 1 Business Day  
  • Target Resolution / Workaround: within 7 Business Days or in next scheduled release

12.3.2 Resolution targets are goals and may be adjusted upon mutual agreement. Persistent or material deviations may be addressed under Section 12.5 and, if unresolved, may constitute a material breach under Article IV.

12.4 **Scheduled Maintenance and Maintenance Windows.**

12.4.1 Horizon may perform routine scheduled maintenance during the following **Maintenance Window**: Sundays, 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Horizon shall provide at least three (3) Business Days’ prior notice for maintenance expected to cause material downtime.

12.4.2 Emergency maintenance may be performed outside the Maintenance Window as necessary to address critical vulnerabilities or system failures. Horizon shall provide as much advance notice as reasonably practicable.

12.5 **Service Credits.**

12.5.1 If the monthly Uptime falls below 99.9% (excluding Excused Downtime), Contoso shall be entitled to Service Credits calculated as a percentage of the monthly Base Managed Services Fee for the affected month, as follows:

  (a) Uptime between 99.0% and 99.89%: 5% credit  
  (b) Uptime between 98.0% and 98.99%: 10% credit  
  (c) Uptime below 98.0%: 20% credit

12.5.2 Service Credits must be requested by Contoso in writing within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the Service Level failure occurred. Credits will be applied to the next invoice(s) issued to Contoso. Service Credits shall not be redeemable for cash, except upon final termination of this Agreement if no future invoices remain.

12.5.3 The total Service Credits in any month shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the monthly Base Managed Services Fee for that month.

Either Party may propose changes to the scope, nature, or timing of the Services (“**Change Requests**”). Change Requests shall be submitted in writing and include a description of the proposed change, the rationale, and any requested timeline.

13.2 **Impact Assessment.**  
Upon receipt of a Change Request from Contoso, Horizon shall, within a reasonable period, evaluate the impact of the proposed change on the Services, fees, timeline, resources, and Service Levels, and shall provide a written change impact assessment to Contoso.

13.3 **Change Orders.**  
No Change Request shall be effective unless and until the Parties agree in writing to a change order (“**Change Order**”) that sets forth the approved changes and any adjustments to fees, timelines, or other terms. Each Change Order shall become part of this Agreement by reference.

## ARTICLE XIV  
DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a “**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiations between the Parties’ designated project managers. If the Parties’ project managers are unable to resolve the Dispute within fifteen (15) Business Days, the Dispute shall be escalated to senior executives of each Party, who shall meet (in person or virtually) and seek to resolve the Dispute within an additional fifteen (15) Business Days.

14.2 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation and escalation, either Party may request non-binding mediation.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after the commencement of mediation (or if mediation is not initiated), either Party may pursue any legal or equitable remedy available to it. Unless the Parties otherwise agree in writing, any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in New York, New York, and each Party irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. The Parties acknowledge that they are knowingly and voluntarily waiving any right to trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by law.

14.4 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary or preliminary injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information or Intellectual Property Rights, without first complying with the negotiation or mediation requirements set forth above.
