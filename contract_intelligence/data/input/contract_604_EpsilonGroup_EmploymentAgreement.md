8.3 **Indemnification Procedures.**

  8.3.1 A Party seeking indemnification (the “**Indemnified Party**”) shall promptly notify the other Party (the “**Indemnifying Party**”) in writing of any claim for which it seeks indemnification, providing reasonable details of the claim. Failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations, except to the extent it is materially prejudiced by such failure.

  8.3.2 The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume control of the defense and settlement of the claim, provided that:  
  (a) it notifies the Indemnified Party of its election in writing;  
  (b) it conducts the defense diligently and in good faith; and  
  (c) it shall not settle any claim in a manner that imposes any admission of liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  8.3.3 The Indemnified Party shall cooperate reasonably with the Indemnifying Party and may participate in the defense at its own cost, except that if the Indemnifying Party fails to assume or diligently pursue the defense, the Indemnified Party may assume the defense, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable costs thereof.

8.4 **IP Infringement Remedies.**  
In the event of any claim that the Deliverables or Vendor Background IP infringe a third party’s Intellectual Property Rights, the Vendor may, at its option and expense:

  8.4.1 procure for the Client the right to continue using the alleged infringing materials;  

  8.4.2 modify the materials so that they become non-infringing while maintaining substantially equivalent functionality; or  

  8.4.3 replace the materials with non-infringing alternatives of substantially equivalent functionality.

If none of the above options is commercially reasonable, the Vendor may terminate the affected Services or Deliverables, and the Client shall be entitled to a pro-rata refund of any prepaid Fees for the affected portion of the Services, subject to the limitations in Article IX.
