  11.3.6 Make available to Client all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with its obligations and allow for audits, as set forth in the relevant data processing agreement.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.**  
Vendor shall notify Client without undue delay after becoming aware of a Personal Data breach affecting Personal Data processed on behalf of Client. Such notification shall, where possible, include information reasonably required for Client to comply with its obligations to notify relevant supervisory authorities and affected data subjects. Vendor shall cooperate with Client in investigating and remediating any such breach.

11.5 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Vendor shall not retain Personal Data longer than necessary for the performance of the Services or as required by Applicable Law.

## CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**
