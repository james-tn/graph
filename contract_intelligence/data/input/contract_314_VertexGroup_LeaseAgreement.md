## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance With Data Protection Laws.** To the extent either Party processes personal data in connection with this Agreement, such Party shall comply with all Applicable Law relating to data protection and privacy, including, where applicable, the CCPA, GDPR, and any other relevant privacy regulations.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.** The Parties anticipate that each will act as a separate and independent “business” or “controller” (as those terms are used in privacy laws) with respect to personal data it collects and processes for its own purposes relating to this Agreement. If Vertex processes personal data solely on behalf of Contoso as a “service provider” or “processor,” the Parties shall enter into a separate data processing addendum as required by Applicable Law.

11.3 **Data Security.** Each Party shall implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal data under its control from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, consistent with industry standards and Applicable Law.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a confirmed unauthorized access, disclosure, or breach of security affecting personal data processed in connection with this Agreement (“Data Breach”), the affected Party shall:  
(a) notify the other Party without undue delay (and in any event within a commercially reasonable time) after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  
(b) provide reasonably available details of the nature of the Data Breach, the categories of data affected, and the remedial actions taken or proposed; and  
(c) cooperate in good faith with the other Party, at the affected Party’s cost, in any legally required notifications or remedial measures.

11.5 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Each Party shall retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, each Party shall, to the extent feasible and in accordance with law, delete or anonymize personal data obtained from the other Party, unless retention is required to comply with legal obligations.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)

12.1 **Applicability.** This Article XII applies to the operation and maintenance Services provided by Vertex to Contoso in connection with the Building systems and any IT-related Services expressly agreed in writing.

12.2 **Uptime Commitment.** Vertex shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that critical Building systems (including electrical power and HVAC) serving the Premises are available **99.9%** of the time during Business Hours each calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and Force Majeure Events.

12.3 **Scheduled Maintenance.** Vertex may schedule maintenance windows during which certain systems may be temporarily unavailable, provided that Vertex:  
(a) provides Contoso with at least five (5) Business Days’ prior notice for any non-emergency maintenance that is reasonably expected to impact services to the Premises; and  
(b) schedules such maintenance outside of Business Hours where reasonably practicable.

12.4 **Response Times.** Vertex shall respond to service requests as follows:  
(a) **Critical Issues** (e.g., complete loss of power or HVAC, health and safety issues): response within **1 hour** during Business Hours and within **2 hours** outside Business Hours;  
(b) **Major Issues** (e.g., partial system failure significantly impacting operations): response within **4 hours** during Business Hours;  
(c) **Minor Issues** (e.g., non-urgent maintenance matters): response within **2 Business Days**.

12.5 **Service Level Reporting.** Upon Contoso’s reasonable request, Vertex shall provide periodic (e.g., quarterly) reports summarizing Service Level performance, including major incidents, response times, and uptime metrics.

12.6 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.**  
(a) **Service Credits.** If Vertex fails to meet the uptime commitment in Section 12.2 in any calendar month by more than 0.5% (i.e., uptime falls below 99.4%), Contoso shall be entitled to Service Credits equal to a reasonable percentage of the monthly Base Rent attributable to the affected Premises, calculated in good faith by Vertex, not to exceed **10%** of such month’s Base Rent.

(b) **Exclusive SLA Remedies.** The Service Credits described above shall be Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for Service Level failures, subject to any other rights and remedies for breach or default under this Agreement, but shall be taken into account when assessing damages.

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may request changes to the scope of Services, Tenant Improvements, or other material aspects of this Agreement (“Change Requests”). All Change Requests shall be made in writing and shall specify the nature of the change, the rationale, and the requested effective date.

13.2 **Assessment and Impact.** Upon receipt of a Change Request from Contoso, Vertex shall, within a reasonable time, provide an assessment of:

(c) any additional terms or technical considerations.

The Parties shall thereafter follow the normal change management process to document and, if applicable, adjust fees or terms.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.** In the event of any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a “Dispute”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal discussions between the Parties’ designated contract managers. If the Dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days, it shall be escalated to senior executives of each Party for further good-faith negotiations for an additional thirty (30) days.

14.2 **Mediation.** If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through negotiation and escalation, either Party may request that the Dispute be submitted to non-binding mediation before a mutually agreed mediator in San Francisco County, California. The Parties shall share the mediator’s fees and expenses equally, and each Party shall bear its own legal costs.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  
(a) If mediation is unsuccessful after a reasonable period, either Party may pursue its rights in accordance with this Section.  
(b) Unless the Parties mutually agree in writing to binding arbitration, any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in **San Francisco County, California**, and each Party hereby submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts.  

14.4 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek preliminary or emergency injunctive relief or other equitable remedies at any time in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or curtail actual or threatened breach of confidentiality obligations or infringement of Intellectual Property rights.

15.2 **Notice and Suspension of Obligations.** The affected Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event and shall be excused from performance of its obligations to the extent and for the duration that performance is prevented or materially hindered by such event. Payment obligations already accrued shall not be excused, but future payment obligations may be equitably adjusted if Services or access to the Premises are materially impacted.

15.3 **Mitigation and Recovery.** The affected Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event and to resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable.

15.4 **Extended Force Majeure.** If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and materially impairs use of the Premises or performance of essential Services, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, without penalty, except for payment of amounts accrued up to the effective date of termination.
