## FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Contract Value (Amendment).**  
The Parties acknowledge that the aggregate estimated value of this Amendment, including all SOWs anticipated as of the Amendment Effective Date, is **USD $2,209,104** (the **“Contract Value (Amendment)”**). This value is separate from, and does not reduce or replace, the **Contract Value** of **USD $2,864,542** referenced in **Section 3.1** of the Master Agreement. As with the Master Agreement, the Contract Value (Amendment) is an **estimate only** and shall not limit the total Fees payable under this Amendment unless explicitly stated in a particular SOW.

Fees for the Amendment Services and Amendment Deliverables shall be set forth in one or more SOWs executed under this Amendment and may include any combination of:

3.3.2 This **Net 60** payment term expressly **supersedes** the **“Net 45”** payment term in **Section 3.3.2** of the Master Agreement solely with respect to Invoices relating to this Amendment. For all other Services not governed by this Amendment, the “Net 45” term remains in effect.

3.3.3 All payments shall be made in U.S. dollars (USD) by wire transfer or such other payment method as may be mutually agreed and detailed in each Invoice, consistent with **Section 3.3.3** of the Master Agreement.

If Client must withhold Taxes, Client shall gross up the amounts so Vendor receives the full Fee amount, as set out in **Section 3.4.2** of the Master Agreement.

3.5 **Late Payment.**  

3.5.1 Any undisputed amount not received under this Amendment within the Net 60 period shall accrue interest at the rate specified in **Section 3.5.1** of the Master Agreement (1.5% per month or the maximum allowed by Applicable Law, whichever is lower), calculated from the due date until payment is received.

Any suspension shall be limited to the Amendment Services and shall not affect other services under the Master Agreement, unless the non-payment relates to those other services as well.

3.6 **Disputed Amounts.**  
The dispute mechanism in **Section 3.6** of the Master Agreement applies to this Amendment. For clarity:

- Client shall notify Vendor within fifteen (15) days of receipt of an Invoice if it disputes any portion thereof;  
- Client shall pay all undisputed amounts by their due dates; and  
- Any amounts later determined to be payable shall be paid within fifteen (15) days of resolution, with late interest as specified in **Section 3.6.2** of the Master Agreement.

3.7 **Expenses and Reimbursement.**  
Client shall reimburse Vendor for reasonable, pre-approved out-of-pocket expenses, including travel and lodging, incurred in performance of the Amendment Services, in accordance with **Section 3.7** of the Master Agreement and Client’s travel and expense policy (as may be updated and communicated to Vendor from time to time).

For multi-year managed services fees under this Amendment, Vendor may adjust its standard rates **once per calendar year** upon at least **ninety (90) days’** prior written notice to Client. Any such increase shall **not exceed three percent (3%) per annum**, which is more client-friendly than the five percent (5%) ceiling allowed in **Section 3.8** of the Master Agreement, and shall be subject to mutual discussion in the PMO.

The definition of “Confidential Information” and the obligations set forth in **Article V (Confidentiality)** of the Master Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference and apply fully to this Amendment and all Amendment Services.

5.2 **Confidential Information (Restated for Clarity).**  
“Confidential Information” includes any non-public, proprietary, or confidential information disclosed under this Amendment, including business plans, architecture designs, security configurations, Client Data, Vendor tools, the terms of this Amendment, and any SOWs referencing it. The existence and terms of this Amendment, including Contract Value (Amendment), are explicitly deemed Confidential Information.

Each Party shall:

- Use the other Party’s Confidential Information **solely** for purposes of performing or receiving Amendment Services;  
- Restrict disclosure of such Confidential Information to those Representatives who have a **need to know** and are bound by obligations no less protective than those set forth herein and in **Article V** of the Master Agreement; and

## ARTICLE VI  
## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

6.1 **Ownership of Client Materials and Client Data.**  
As reaffirmed in **Section 6.1** of the Master Agreement, Client retains all right, title, and interest in and to Client Materials and Client Data. Nothing in this Amendment transfers ownership of Client’s Intellectual Property Rights to Vendor.

6.2 **License to Client Materials and Client Data.**  
Client grants Vendor a license under **Section 6.2** of the Master Agreement to use Client Materials and Client Data solely as necessary to perform the Amendment Services and provide the Amendment Deliverables.

6.3 **Vendor Pre-Existing IP.**  
Vendor retains ownership of all Vendor Pre-Existing IP as defined in **Section 6.3** of the Master Agreement, including tools, methodologies, libraries, and frameworks used in performing the Amendment Services.

6.4 **Work Product and Amendment Deliverables.**  

6.4.1 As between the Parties, and subject to Sections 6.4.2 and 6.5, **Client-friendly modification**: for the Amendment Deliverables specifically developed under this Amendment and fully paid for by Client, **Client shall own all right, title, and interest (including all Intellectual Property Rights)** in such Amendment Deliverables, excluding embedded Vendor Pre-Existing IP and Third-Party Materials.  

6.4.2 Vendor shall retain ownership of Vendor Pre-Existing IP and any generic know-how, methodologies, templates, and improvements developed while performing the Amendment Services that are of general applicability and do not incorporate Client Materials or Client Data in an identifiable way.

6.5 **License Grants.**  

6.5.1 **License to Client of Vendor Pre-Existing IP.** To the extent that any Amendment Deliverables incorporate Vendor Pre-Existing IP, Vendor grants Client a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable (in connection with permitted assignments under Section 16.7) license**, with the right to sublicense to Client’s Affiliates and service providers acting on its behalf, to use such Vendor Pre-Existing IP solely as integrated into or necessary to use the Amendment Deliverables for Client’s internal business purposes. This is more favorable than the non-transferable, non-sublicensable license in **Section 6.6** of the Master Agreement and is granted solely for the Amendment Deliverables.

6.5.2 **License to Vendor of Feedback.** The Feedback provisions of **Section 6.7** of the Master Agreement apply to the Amendment Services. Client assigns to Vendor any right in Feedback provided, and Vendor may use it without restriction, provided that Vendor does not disclose Client’s Confidential Information in connection with such use.

6.6 **Infringement Mitigation.**  
The infringement mitigation mechanism in **Section 6.8** of the Master Agreement applies to Amendment Deliverables and Amendment Services. Vendor’s obligations to obtain rights, modify, replace, or refund Fees in the event of infringement shall extend to the Amendment Deliverables on the same basis.
