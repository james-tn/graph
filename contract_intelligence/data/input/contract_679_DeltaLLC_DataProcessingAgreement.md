## ARTICLE XI  
### DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.** For purposes of this Agreement and applicable Data Protection Laws, Client is the Controller (or business) and Vendor is the Processor (or service provider) with respect to Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.** Vendor shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Client set forth in this Agreement, any SOW, or as otherwise provided in writing, including with respect to cross-border transfers of Personal Data, unless required to do so by applicable law. Vendor shall promptly inform Client if, in Vendor’s opinion, an instruction infringes applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.3 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with its respective obligations under applicable Data Protection Laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

  11.3.1 Client shall ensure that it has a valid legal basis under applicable Data Protection Laws for the processing of Personal Data by Vendor as contemplated by this Agreement;

  11.3.2 Vendor shall provide reasonable assistance to Client, at Client’s expense, in fulfilling Client’s obligations to respond to requests from data subjects and to comply with obligations relating to security, data breach notifications, data protection impact assessments, and consultations with supervisory authorities, as required by Data Protection Laws and to the extent Vendor is reasonably able to do so given the nature of the processing and the information available to Vendor.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Vendor may engage Subprocessors to process Personal Data on its behalf, provided that: (a) Vendor shall enter into a written contract with each Subprocessor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement; and (b) Vendor shall remain responsible for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors. Vendor shall maintain an up-to-date list of Subprocessors and make such list available to Client upon request. Client may reasonably object in writing to a new Subprocessor on data protection grounds within ten (10) Business Days of Vendor’s notice of such Subprocessor; in such case, the Parties shall discuss in good faith an alternative arrangement. If the Parties cannot reach agreement within thirty (30) days, Vendor may, at its discretion, either not engage the Subprocessor for Client-related processing or, upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, terminate the affected Services.

11.5 **Technical and Organizational Measures.** Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate Technical and Organizational Measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, having regard to the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, and the risk to data subjects. Such measures shall include, at a minimum: (a) access controls and authentication; (b) encryption of Personal Data in transit and at rest where commercially reasonable; (c) physical and environmental security; (d) security incident response procedures; (e) regular security testing and vulnerability management; and (f) employee training and confidentiality obligations.

11.6 **Security Incidents and Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a Security Incident involving Personal Data, Vendor shall:

  11.6.1 Notify Client without undue delay and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Security Incident;

  11.6.2 Provide Client with reasonable information about the Security Incident, including the nature of the incident, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned, the categories and approximate number of Personal Data records concerned, the likely consequences of the incident, and the measures taken or proposed to be taken to address the incident and mitigate its effects; and

  11.6.3 Cooperate with Client, at Client’s expense, in investigating the Security Incident, mitigating its effects, and complying with any legal or regulatory notification obligations.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vendor shall retain Personal Data for no longer than is necessary to provide the Services or as required by applicable law. Upon termination of this Agreement or upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall, at Client’s choice, delete or return Personal Data to Client, unless applicable law requires retention. Any deletion shall be performed in accordance with Vendor’s standard procedures and industry best practices.

11.8 **Data Subject Rights.** Vendor shall, to the extent legally permitted and technically feasible, promptly notify Client if it receives a request from a data subject to exercise rights under applicable Data Protection Laws (such as access, rectification, deletion, or data portability) with respect to Personal Data processed on behalf of Client. Vendor shall not respond directly to such requests without Client’s prior written authorization, except where otherwise required by law. Vendor shall provide reasonable assistance to Client, at Client’s expense, in responding to such requests.

11.9 **Data Protection Impact Assessments and Audit.** Vendor shall provide reasonably requested information to enable Client to conduct data protection impact assessments and consultations with supervisory authorities as required by Data Protection Laws, to the extent related to Vendor’s processing of Personal Data on behalf of Client. Upon at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, and no more than once in any twelve (12)-month period (except following a Security Incident or if required by a supervisory authority), Client may, at its own expense, conduct or have conducted an audit of Vendor’s compliance with this Article XI, which may include a review of relevant documentation and, if necessary, on-site inspections during normal business hours, subject to Vendor’s reasonable security and confidentiality rules. Client shall not unreasonably interfere with Vendor’s business operations, and any third-party auditor shall be bound by confidentiality obligations acceptable to Vendor.

11.10 **International Data Transfers.** To the extent that Vendor processes Personal Data subject to the GDPR or other laws imposing restrictions on cross-border data transfers, and Personal Data is transferred to a country that does not provide an adequate level of protection as determined by the European Commission or other competent authority, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards, such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses or other mechanisms recognized under applicable Data Protection Laws. The Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to implement such safeguards.

11.11 **CCPA-Specific Terms.** For Personal Data subject to the CCPA, Vendor shall: (a) not sell or share (as those terms are defined under the CCPA) Personal Data; (b) not retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any purpose other than providing the Services or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA; (c) not retain, use, or disclose Personal Data outside the direct business relationship between Client and Vendor; and (d) certify that Vendor understands and will comply with the foregoing restrictions. Vendor may de-identify or aggregate Personal Data, provided that such process complies with applicable Data Protection Laws.

13.5 **Urgent Changes.** In the event that an urgent change is required to address a material security vulnerability, regulatory requirement, or to prevent imminent harm, Vendor may implement such change without a prior Change Order, provided that Vendor uses reasonable efforts to notify Client in advance and documents the change and its impact in writing as soon as practicable thereafter.

The arbitrators shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including injunctive relief and damages, subject to the terms of this Agreement. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

14.4 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief or other equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm, misuse or misappropriation of Confidential Information, or infringement of Intellectual Property Rights, without first participating in mediation or arbitration.

14.5 **Attorneys’ Fees.** The prevailing Party in any arbitration or legal action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs from the non-prevailing Party, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.
