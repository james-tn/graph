## ARTICLE III – FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Contract Value.**  
In consideration for the Maintenance and Support Services to be provided by Meridian under this Maintenance Agreement during the period from May 18, 2026 to May 17, 2029, Contoso shall pay Meridian an aggregate contract value of **Two Million Two Hundred Twenty Thousand Five Hundred Fifty‑Seven U.S. Dollars (US$2,220,557)** (the “**Maintenance Contract Value**”), subject to adjustments pursuant to **Sections 3.5** and **3.6** below.

3.2 **Fee Structure.**  
Unless otherwise agreed in writing:

  a. The Maintenance Contract Value shall be allocated approximately as follows:  
     i. **Annual Core Maintenance Fees:** US$650,000 per year for three (3) years (US$1,950,000 total), covering standard Maintenance Services, including corrective and preventive maintenance, updates, and support;  
     ii. **Enhanced SLA Premium:** US$70,557 total for enhanced service levels and expanded Service Credits as described in **Article XII**;  
     iii. **Contingency Pool for Minor Enhancements and Special Support Projects:** US$200,000 total, to be used only with prior written approval by Contoso via RFCs or SOWs and subject to reconciliation as described in **Section 3.5**;

  b. The amounts above are **exclusive of Taxes**, consistent with **Section 3.6** of the Parent Agreement.

3.3 **Invoicing and Payment Terms.**  

  a. Meridian shall invoice Contoso for the **Annual Core Maintenance Fees** in **advance**, in three (3) equal annual installments on or about:  
     - May 18, 2026 (for the first contract year),  
     - May 18, 2027 (for the second contract year), and  
     - May 18, 2028 (for the third contract year, covering through May 17, 2029);

  b. The **Enhanced SLA Premium** shall be invoiced pro rata together with each annual invoice;

  c. The **Contingency Pool** shall be invoiced only as amounts are authorized by Contoso in writing via RFCs or SOWs, and such invoices shall reference this Maintenance Agreement and the applicable RFC or SOW;

  d. Payment terms under this Maintenance Agreement shall be **Net 30**, meaning all undisputed invoices are due and payable within **thirty (30) days** of the invoice date, which is more Client‑favorable than the “Net 60” terms in **Section 3.3** of the Parent Agreement and is hereby agreed as a specific modification for Maintenance Services;

  e. Payments shall be made in U.S. dollars via wire transfer, ACH, or another mutually agreed method.

3.4 **Late Payment.**  
Any undisputed amount not received by Meridian by the applicable due date shall accrue interest at a rate of the lesser of: (i) one percent (1.0%) per month, or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, from the due date until paid, provided that Meridian may not suspend Maintenance Services unless any amount remains unpaid more than **forty‑five (45) days** after written notice of non‑payment, and only if Contoso has not reasonably disputed such amount in good faith. This provision is more favorable to Contoso than **Section 3.4** of the Parent Agreement, reflecting the low risk allocation.

3.5 **Fee Reconciliation and Adjustments.**  

  a. Meridian shall provide an annual reconciliation report showing amounts drawn from the **Contingency Pool**, with detail by RFC or SOW; any unused portion as of the end of the Term shall, at Contoso’s option, either (i) be refunded to Contoso, or (ii) applied as a credit toward any renewal maintenance agreement;

If Contoso materially reduces the number of active Users or modules covered by Maintenance Services (for example, by more than 20% from the baseline described in **Section 3.1(a)** of the Parent Agreement), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith an equitable downward adjustment to the remaining Annual Core Maintenance Fees;

  c. Any **increase** in scope that materially increases Meridian’s costs (e.g., expansion to additional modules or users) shall be addressed via RFC or SOW, consistent with **Article XIII** and **Section 3.8** of the Parent Agreement.

3.6 **Taxes and Expenses.**  

  a. Taxes shall be handled in accordance with **Section 3.6** of the Parent Agreement. Contoso remains responsible for all applicable Taxes, excluding taxes on Meridian’s net income, property, or employees;

  b. The Maintenance Fees are intended to be **all‑inclusive** for remote Maintenance Services. Any on‑site visits, travel, or extraordinary expenses must be **pre‑approved in writing** by Contoso and shall be reimbursed in accordance with the expense reimbursement principles set forth in **Section 3.7** of the Parent Agreement.

3.7 **Disputed Amounts.**  
Contoso may withhold payment of any fees that it reasonably and in good faith disputes, provided that Contoso notifies Meridian in writing within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the invoice, specifying the grounds for dispute, and pays all undisputed amounts when due. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any billing disputes promptly, consistent with **Section 3.5** of the Parent Agreement.

## ARTICLE IV – TERM AND TERMINATION

4.1 **Term.**  
This Maintenance Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in full force and effect until **May 17, 2029** (the “**Term**”), unless earlier terminated in accordance with this **Article IV**. This Term overlaps with and slightly extends beyond the Initial Term of the Parent Agreement (which ends on **September 18, 2028** as per **Section 1.12** and **Section 4.1** of the Parent Agreement) to provide continuity of Maintenance Services and potential transition support.

4.2 **Renewal.**  
The Parties may, by mutual written agreement (including via renewal order form, SOW, or amendment referencing both **SLA-MER-202509-056** and **MNT-MER-202509-067**), renew this Maintenance Agreement for successive one (1) year renewal terms on terms to be mutually agreed at the time of renewal.

  b. Termination of this Maintenance Agreement shall not, by itself, terminate the Parent Agreement; however, if Contoso terminates this Maintenance Agreement for Meridian’s uncured material breach of maintenance obligations, such breach may constitute a material breach of the Parent Agreement and may entitle Contoso to exercise its rights under **Section 4.4** of the Parent Agreement, subject to any cure rights therein.

4.7 **Effect of Termination.**  
Upon any expiration or termination of this Maintenance Agreement:

  a. Meridian shall cease providing Maintenance Services hereunder as of the effective date, except as may be necessary to complete any in‑progress error correction or transition assistance expressly agreed in writing;

  b. Meridian shall, at Contoso’s written request, provide reasonable **transition assistance** for up to sixty (60) days after the effective date of termination, at Meridian’s then‑current time‑and‑materials rates (or at rates agreed in a SOW), to enable Contoso to transition Maintenance Services to an internal team or a third party;

5.6 **Survival.**

## ARTICLE VIII – INDEMNIFICATION

8.1 **Indemnification by Meridian.**  
Meridian’s obligations to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Contoso for intellectual property infringement and other claims arising from the Software remain as set forth in **Article VIII** of the Parent Agreement. To the extent any claim arises out of or relates to updates, patches, or other modifications to the Software provided under this Maintenance Agreement, such claim shall be treated as a claim relating to the “Software” for purposes of **Section 8.1** of the Parent Agreement.

8.2 **Indemnification by Contoso.**  
Contoso’s obligations under **Section 8.2** of the Parent Agreement (relating to data and use) extend to claims arising from Contoso’s use of the Maintenance Services in violation of this Maintenance Agreement or applicable law.

8.3 **Additional Indemnity – Data Breach Due to Maintenance Activities.**  
Without limiting the Parent Agreement, if a Data Breach (as defined in **Section 11.5** of the Parent Agreement and **Article XI** herein) is directly and primarily caused by Meridian’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of the Maintenance Services, Meridian shall indemnify and hold harmless Contoso from third‑party claims resulting directly from such Data Breach, subject to the limitations and procedures set forth in **Article VIII** of the Parent Agreement and **Article IX** of this Maintenance Agreement.

  c. Service Credits shall:  
     i. Be applied against future Maintenance invoices;  
     ii. Be requested by Contoso in writing within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the SLA breach occurred; and  
     iii. Be the **primary remedy** for SLA breaches, without prejudice to Contoso’s right to terminate for chronic failure as set forth below.

12.6 **Chronic Failure and Termination.**  
If Meridian fails to meet the Enhanced Availability Commitment or the Priority 1 response/resolution targets for **three (3) or more months in any rolling six (6) month period**, Contoso may, upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, terminate this Maintenance Agreement for cause without penalty and receive a pro rata refund of any prepaid, unused Maintenance Fees, in addition to any accrued Service Credits.
