### DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

  11.1.2 Titan acts as Processor (or "service provider" under CCPA).

11.10 **Data Transfers.** Titan shall not transfer Personal Data to a Third Country or international organization without Contoso’s prior written authorization and subject to appropriate safeguards in accordance with Applicable Data Protection Law, such as standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, or an adequacy decision. Where such transfers occur, Titan shall ensure that Data Subjects continue to benefit from enforceable rights and effective legal remedies.

11.11 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Titan shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary for the purposes of providing the Services or as required by applicable law.
