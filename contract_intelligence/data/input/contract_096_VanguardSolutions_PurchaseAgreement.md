11.2 **Roles of the Parties.** To the extent Vanguard processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso in the course of providing the Services, the Parties agree that Contoso shall be the “controller” and Vanguard shall be the “processor” (as such terms are defined in the UK GDPR). The Parties shall enter into a separate data processing agreement (DPA) or include data processing terms in an annex to this Agreement, which shall form part of this Agreement and govern such processing.

11.3 **Processing Instructions.** Vanguard shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, except where required to do so by applicable law, in which case Vanguard shall inform Contoso of that legal requirement before processing, unless such law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.

11.4 **Security Measures.** Vanguard shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, and shall ensure that all persons authorised to process Personal Data are bound by confidentiality obligations.

11.5 **Sub‑Processors.** Vanguard shall not engage any sub‑processor to process Personal Data on behalf of Contoso without Contoso’s prior written consent (which may be given in general terms for categories of sub‑processors).

11.6 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a personal data breach (as defined in the UK GDPR) affecting Personal Data processed by Vanguard on behalf of Contoso, Vanguard shall notify Contoso without undue delay after becoming aware of the breach and shall provide Contoso with sufficient information to enable Contoso to meet its obligations to notify the relevant supervisory authorities and data subjects. Vanguard shall take all reasonably necessary steps to mitigate the effects of the breach and prevent recurrence.

11.7 **Data Subject Rights.** Vanguard shall assist Contoso, to the extent reasonably possible and at Contoso’s expense where permitted by law, in responding to any requests from data subjects and in complying with Contoso’s obligations under Data Protection Laws with respect to security, breach notifications, impact assessments, and consultations with supervisory authorities.

11.8 **International Transfers.** Vanguard shall not transfer Personal Data outside the United Kingdom or European Economic Area (EEA) (as applicable) without Contoso’s prior written consent and without ensuring that adequate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent mechanisms) are in place in accordance with Data Protection Laws.

11.9 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vanguard shall not retain Personal Data for longer than is necessary for the purposes of providing the Services or as required by applicable law. Upon expiry or termination of this Agreement, or upon Contoso’s written request, Vanguard shall delete or return all Personal Data processed on behalf of Contoso, unless applicable law requires retention. Any retained Personal Data shall remain subject to the confidentiality and security obligations set forth herein.

11.10 **CCPA Compliance (if applicable).** To the extent Vanguard processes Personal Information (as defined in the CCPA) of California residents on behalf of Contoso, Vanguard agrees to act as a “service provider” under the CCPA and shall not (a) sell such Personal Information; (b) retain, use or disclose such Personal Information for any purpose other than the specific purpose of performing the Services; or (c) combine such Personal Information with other data except as permitted under the CCPA.

14.4 **Jurisdiction and Venue.** Subject to Sections 14.1 to 14.3, any Dispute shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
