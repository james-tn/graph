8.4 **Infringement Remedies.**  
If any portion of the Services or Deliverables becomes, or in Vendor’s reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, Vendor may, at its option and expense: (i) procure for Client the right to continue using the affected Services or Deliverables; (ii) replace or modify the affected portion to make it non-infringing while retaining materially equivalent functionality; or (iii) if neither of the foregoing is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected Services or Deliverables and refund to Client any prepaid, unused fees for such Services or Deliverables. This Section 8.4 sets forth Client’s exclusive remedy for infringement claims relating to the Services and Deliverables, subject to the overall limitations of liability in Article IX.
