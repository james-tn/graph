## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)

12.1 **Applicability.** This Article XII applies to any managed or ongoing Services designated in an SOW as subject to SLAs, including system monitoring, application support, and hosted services.

12.2 **Availability/Uptime.** For any hosted or managed services provided by Pinnacle, Pinnacle shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such services are available at least **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance windows and emergency maintenance (the “Uptime Commitment”).

12.4 **Incident Response Times.** Pinnacle shall adhere to the following target response times for reported incidents:

  (a) **Priority 1 (Critical)** – system-wide outage or critical business impact: response within one (1) hour;  
  (b) **Priority 2 (High)** – major functionality impaired with significant business impact: response within four (4) hours;  
  (c) **Priority 3 (Medium)** – partial loss of functionality with limited business impact: response within one (1) Business Day;

12.6 **Chronic SLA Failures.** If Pinnacle fails to meet the Uptime Commitment or other critical Service Levels in three (3) or more months in any rolling six (6) month period, Contoso may treat such failure as a material breach and may terminate the affected Services or SOW for cause pursuant to Section 4.4.

## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Informal Resolution.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Services, or the Deliverables (a “Dispute”), the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the Dispute informally through good faith negotiations between the Parties’ project managers or primary points of contact.

14.2 **Escalation.** If the Dispute is not resolved within fifteen (15) Business Days after written notice of the Dispute is provided by one Party to the other, either Party may escalate the Dispute to senior executives of the Parties (e.g., Vice President-level or higher), who shall meet (in person, by phone, or via videoconference) within ten (10) Business Days to attempt to resolve the Dispute.

14.3 **Mediation.** If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after escalation to senior management, either Party may request that the Dispute be submitted to non-binding mediation before a mutually agreed mediator in Texas.
