  a. Each Party’s total aggregate liability to the other Party for all claims arising during any twelve (12) month period shall not exceed **two (2) times** the total Amendment Fees paid or payable by Contoso to Epsilon under this Amendment during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.  

  b. For clarity, this cap is separate from and does not reduce or increase the liability cap in **Section 9.2** of the Parent Agreement, which remains applicable to claims arising purely under the Parent Agreement and not related to this Amendment.

9.3 **Exceptions.**  
The limitations in Section 9.2 of this Amendment and **Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement** shall not apply to:

  a. A Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII** of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment;  

  b. A Party’s breach of **Article V (Confidentiality)** of the Parent Agreement or this Amendment;  

  c. A Party’s infringement or misappropriation of the other Party’s intellectual property rights; or  

  d. A Party’s gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud.

9.4 **Risk Allocation.**  
The Parties acknowledge that the limitations of liability in this Article IX and **Article IX of the Parent Agreement** reflect a mutual allocation of risk consistent with the **medium risk** classification of this engagement, taking into account the combined Contract Value and Amendment Contract Value, the nature of the Services, and the Parties’ respective obligations.

11.1 **Roles of the Parties and Laws Covered.**  
The roles defined in **Section 11.1** of the Parent Agreement remain unchanged: Contoso is the **Controller/Business**, and Epsilon is the **Processor/Service Provider**. The definition of **Applicable Data Protection Laws** in **Section 1.3 of the Parent Agreement** is hereby expanded to expressly include Brazil’s LGPD, Canada’s PIPEDA, and any materially similar data protection laws of U.S. states (including, without limitation, Colorado, Virginia, and Connecticut privacy laws) that become applicable to the processing under this Amendment.

11.2 **Updated Instructions.**  
Epsilon shall continue to process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, as required under **Section 11.2 of the Parent Agreement**, including with respect to data transfers to third countries. For clarity, any SOW – Data Expansion and related documentation (e.g., Data Mapping and Schema Documentation) will form part of Contoso’s documented Data Processing Instructions.

11.3 **Compliance and Notification of Inability to Comply.**  
The compliance obligations in **Section 11.3 of the Parent Agreement** are reaffirmed. If Epsilon believes that a Contoso instruction violates Applicable Data Protection Laws or if Epsilon can no longer comply with any Applicable Data Protection Law, including the CCPA/CPRA provisions in **Section 11.11** of the Parent Agreement, Epsilon shall promptly notify Contoso in writing and cooperate in good faith to adjust processing as necessary.

11.4 **Data Subject Rights Assistance.**  
Epsilon’s obligation to assist Contoso in responding to Data Subject requests as stated in **Section 11.4 of the Parent Agreement** is extended to cover any additional rights introduced by new Applicable Data Protection Laws during the Amendment Term, such as rights to correction, restriction, or appeal of automated decisions.

11.5 **Enhanced Security Measures.**  
The security measures in **Section 11.5 of the Parent Agreement** are reaffirmed and supplemented as follows:

  a. **Encryption.** Epsilon shall encrypt Personal Data in transit using industry-standard protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher) and at rest using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256 or equivalent), except where encryption is not technically feasible as agreed in writing by the Parties.

  c. **Logging and Monitoring.** Epsilon shall maintain audit logs recording administrative access to Personal Data and systems processing Personal Data and shall retain such logs for at least twelve (12) months or such longer period as agreed in writing.  

  d. **Vulnerability Management.** Epsilon shall maintain a vulnerability management program, including regular vulnerability scanning, timely application of security patches, and remediation of critical vulnerabilities in a timeframe consistent with industry standards.  

  e. **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery.** Epsilon shall maintain and periodically test business continuity and disaster recovery plans designed to ensure operations continuity and timely restoration of access to Personal Data in the event of an incident.

11.6 **Confidentiality of Personnel.**  
Epsilon reaffirms that all personnel authorized to process Personal Data shall be subject to confidentiality obligations no less stringent than those described in **Section 11.6 of the Parent Agreement**.

11.7 **Data Breach Notification (Clarified).**  
The Data Breach notification obligations in **Section 11.7 of the Parent Agreement** (notification without undue delay, and within 48 hours) remain in effect. In addition, Epsilon shall:

  a. Provide updates as additional information becomes available; and  

  b. Cooperate with Contoso in preparing any legally required notifications to Data Subjects or regulatory authorities, at Contoso’s direction.

11.8 **Subprocessors.**  
The Subprocessor provisions in **Section 11.8 of the Parent Agreement** apply fully, including the requirement that Subprocessors be subject to contractual obligations no less protective than those imposed on Epsilon and Contoso’s right to object to New Subprocessors involved in Enhanced Services.

11.9 **International Transfers.**  
The obligations in **Section 11.9 of the Parent Agreement** are reaffirmed. Where Personal Data is transferred across borders under the Enhanced Services, Epsilon shall implement appropriate International Transfer Mechanisms (e.g., standard contractual clauses) and shall provide Contoso with relevant documentation upon reasonable request.

11.10 **Data Retention and Deletion (Clarified).**  
The data return/deletion obligations in **Section 11.10 of the Parent Agreement** continue to apply. For Enhanced Services, Epsilon shall:

  a. Implement retention rules consistent with Contoso’s instructions, including time-based deletion and “right to be forgotten” requests;  

  b. Upon termination or expiration, return or securely delete all Personal Data and derived data that still qualifies as Personal Data within sixty (60) days, except where retention is required by law; and  

  c. Provide a written certification of deletion upon Contoso’s request, subject to legal, regulatory, or archival exceptions as permitted in the Parent Agreement.

11.11 **CCPA/CPRA-Specific Provisions (Extended).**  
The CCPA/CPRA provisions in **Section 11.11 of the Parent Agreement** are reaffirmed. Epsilon shall not sell or share Personal Information processed under the Enhanced Services and shall not combine such Personal Information with other data except as permitted for Service Provider purposes under CCPA/CPRA or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties.

11.12 **Audits and Assessments.**  
The audit rights in **Section 11.12 of the Parent Agreement** are reaffirmed. In addition, Contoso may request, no more than once annually (except after a Data Breach), that Epsilon provide a copy of its most current SOC 2, ISO 27001, or equivalent security assessment report, which Epsilon shall provide under confidentiality.

11.13 **Records of Processing and DPIAs.**  
Epsilon shall maintain Processing Records for activities undertaken as part of the Enhanced Services, as required by Article 30 of the GDPR and analogous laws. Upon Contoso’s request, Epsilon shall provide information reasonably necessary for Contoso to conduct or update a DPIA for high-risk processing related to the Enhanced Services.

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA) (AMENDED)

12.1 **Uptime Commitment (Enhanced).**  
The Uptime Commitment in **Section 12.1 of the Parent Agreement** (99.9% per calendar month) remains the baseline. For the Enhanced Services, Epsilon shall use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve at least **99.95%** uptime per calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and Force Majeure Events.

The Scheduled Maintenance provisions in **Section 12.2** of the Parent Agreement remain in effect, with the understanding that Epsilon will coordinate maintenance windows in a manner that minimizes impact on the Enhanced Services.

The response times in **Section 12.3** of the Parent Agreement apply. Epsilon shall also:

12.5 **Exclusions.**  
The exclusions in **Section 12.5** of the Parent Agreement (issues caused by Contoso’s systems, misuse, third-party services, Scheduled Maintenance, or Force Majeure) continue to apply.

---

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT (SUPPLEMENTAL)

13.1 **Change Requests for Enhanced Services.**
