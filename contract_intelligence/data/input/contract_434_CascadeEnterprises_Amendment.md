## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (AMENDMENT)

9.1 **Modification of Parent Article IX for Medium Risk Profile.**  
The Parties acknowledge that **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)** of the Parent Agreement provides for *uncapped liability* and expressly *includes consequential damages*. For the **Amendment Services** and the Extended Term only, the Parties agree to modify that allocation of risk as follows.

9.2 **Aggregate Liability Cap.**  
(a) **Cap Amount.** For claims arising solely out of or relating to this Amendment and the Amendment Services (including the Extended Term), the **total aggregate liability** of each Party to the other, whether arising in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, shall be **capped at three (3) times the total fees (Base Rent plus Additional Rent for Operating Expenses and Taxes, but excluding optional service fees) actually paid by Contoso to Cascade under this Amendment during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.  

(b) For clarity, this cap applies only to liabilities arising under this Amendment; claims that arise exclusively under the Parent Agreement prior to the Amendment Effective Date remain subject to the uncapped liability regime of the Parent Agreement.

9.3 **Exclusion of Consequential Damages.**  
(a) For claims arising solely out of or relating to this Amendment and the Amendment Services, **neither Party shall be liable to the other for any consequential, indirect, special, exemplary, or incidental damages**, including loss of profits, loss of business, or loss of data, arising from or relating to this Amendment, even if advised of the possibility of such damages and even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose.  

(b) The foregoing exclusion does not affect any liability that cannot be excluded under Applicable Law, nor does it limit a Party’s obligation to pay amounts expressly due under this Amendment (e.g., Base Rent, Additional Rent, early termination fees).

9.4 **Exceptions.**  
The cap in **Section 9.2** and the exclusion in **Section 9.3** shall not apply to:  
(a) a Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct;  
(b) a Party’s breach of **Article V (Confidentiality)** or **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)**;
