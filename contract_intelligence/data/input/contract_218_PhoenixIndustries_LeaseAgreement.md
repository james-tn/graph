DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with any personal data processed under or in connection with this Agreement.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.** The Parties anticipate that each Party will generally act as an independent controller of any personal data it processes in connection with this Agreement.

11.5 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Phoenix shall not retain personal data processed on behalf of Contoso longer than is necessary for the purposes of performing the Services or as required by law.

11.6 **International Transfers.** Phoenix shall not transfer personal data processed on behalf of Contoso outside the UK or EEA unless such transfer is in compliance with Data Protection Laws, including the use of appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses where required.

12.2 **Uptime Commitment.** For building systems essential to the basic operation of the Premises (including power supply to common areas, base building HVAC, and access control systems), Phoenix shall use reasonable efforts to ensure an average **monthly uptime of 99.9%**, excluding scheduled maintenance and Force Majeure Events.

  (c) **Routine Issues** (e.g., minor repairs, non-urgent maintenance requests): response within 2 Business Days.

12.4 **Remedies for SLA Failures.** If Phoenix fails to meet the applicable Service Levels in any calendar month (excluding failures caused by Contoso’s acts or omissions or Force Majeure Events), Contoso may be entitled to Service Credits as follows:

  (a) For uptime below 99.9% but at or above 99.0%: Service Credit equal to 2% of the monthly Service Fee.  
  (b) For uptime below 99.0%: Service Credit equal to 5% of the monthly Service Fee.  

12.5 **Limitations on Service Credits.** Service Credits shall:

  (a) be Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy for SLA failures (without prejudice to Contoso’s rights in respect of other contractual breaches);  
  (b) not exceed 20% of the monthly Service Fee in any single month; and  
  (c) be applied as a credit against future invoices, not refunded in cash.

12.6 **Procedure for Claiming Service Credits.** Contoso must submit any claim for Service Credits in writing within thirty (30) days following the end of the month in which the SLA failure occurred, providing reasonable details. Phoenix shall review the claim and notify Contoso of its determination within thirty (30) days. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, Phoenix’s system logs and records shall be determinative.

## ARTICLE XIII  
CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may, at any time, request changes to the scope, nature, or timing of the Services or to the use and configuration of the Premises (a “Change Request”). Change Requests shall be submitted in writing and shall include a description of the requested change and any relevant details.

13.2 **Impact Assessment.** Upon receiving a Change Request from Contoso, Phoenix shall assess the technical, commercial, and timing impacts of the requested change and provide Contoso with a written proposal setting out:

13.5 **Emergency Changes.** In an emergency or where required by law or by a regulatory authority, Phoenix may implement changes without prior approval from Contoso, provided that Phoenix informs Contoso as soon as reasonably practicable and consults with Contoso regarding any ongoing implications.
