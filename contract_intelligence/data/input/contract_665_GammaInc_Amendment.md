## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY  

11.1 **Compliance with Applicable Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its performance under this Amendment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Vendor shall: (a) process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Client and as necessary to provide the Services; and (b) implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

11.2 **Role of the Parties.** The Parties acknowledge that, with respect to Personal Data processed in connection with the Services, Client is the “controller” (or equivalent term under Applicable Data Protection Laws) and Vendor is the “processor” (or equivalent term), except where Vendor determines the purposes and means of processing in which case Vendor may be considered a controller for such limited processing; however, Vendor shall not engage in such independent processing without Client’s prior written consent, except as required by law.

11.3 **Data Processing Addendum.** If required by Applicable Data Protection Laws, the Parties shall execute a separate data processing addendum (**“DPA”**) that shall form part of and be incorporated into this Amendment. In the event of any conflict between this Amendment and the DPA with respect to the processing of Personal Data, the DPA shall control.

11.4 **Data Security.** Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures, consistent with industry best practices, designed to protect Customer Data and Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Such measures shall include, at a minimum: (a) access controls and authentication; (b) encryption of data in transit over public networks and at rest where reasonably practicable; (c) regular vulnerability assessments; and (d) logging and monitoring of access to production systems.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized access to or acquisition of Customer Data or Personal Data in Vendor’s possession or control that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of such data (a **“Data Breach”**), Vendor shall:

11.5.1 Notify Client without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours of becoming aware of the Data Breach;  

11.5.2 Provide Client with timely information relating to the Data Breach as it becomes known, including the nature and scope of the incident, categories and approximate number of data subjects and records affected, likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to address the Data Breach; and  

11.5.3 Cooperate with Client and law enforcement or regulatory authorities, as appropriate, in investigating and mitigating the Data Breach, including providing reasonable assistance with any required notifications to affected individuals or regulators, at Vendor’s expense to the extent the Data Breach is caused by Vendor’s breach of this Amendment.

11.6 **Subprocessors.** Vendor shall not engage any subprocessor to process Personal Data without ensuring that such subprocessor is bound by written terms that impose substantially similar data protection obligations as those imposed on Vendor under this Amendment and any applicable DPA. Vendor shall remain responsible for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors to the same extent as if performed directly by Vendor.

11.7 **Data Subject Rights.** Vendor shall provide reasonable assistance to Client, at Client’s expense and taking into account the nature of the processing, to enable Client to respond to requests from data subjects exercising their rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws (such as rights of access, rectification, erasure, and data portability) with respect to Personal Data processed by Vendor.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vendor shall retain Personal Data and Customer Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services or as required by Applicable Law.

The Parties shall share equally the fees and expenses of the mediator, and each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.**
