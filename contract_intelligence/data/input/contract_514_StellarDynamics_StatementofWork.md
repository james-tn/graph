  - (a) any allegation that the Deliverables or Work Product (excluding Client Materials and Third-Party Materials provided or specified by Client) infringe or misappropriate any third party’s Intellectual Property rights;  
  - (b) Vendor’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in performing the Services; or  
  - (c) Vendor’s material breach of this SOW or violation of Applicable Law in connection with the Services.

8.2 **Indemnification by Client.**

  - (b) permit the Indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of the Claim; and  
  - (c) provide reasonable cooperation at the Indemnifying Party’s expense.

  - (b) replace or modify the Deliverable so that it becomes non-infringing while maintaining materially equivalent functionality; or  
  - (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected Deliverables and Services and refund to Client the fees paid for such Deliverables, less a reasonable depreciation for use.

8.5 **Exclusions.**  
Vendor shall have no obligation under **Section 8.1(a)** to the extent a Claim arises from:  
  - (a) Client Materials or any specifications or designs provided by Client;  
  - (b) modification of the Deliverables by Client or any third party not authorized by Vendor;  
  - (c) combination of the Deliverables with products, services, or data not provided by Vendor, where the Claim would not have arisen but for such combination; or  
  - (d) Client’s use of the Deliverables after Vendor has notified Client to discontinue such use in order to avoid infringement.
