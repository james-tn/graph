(c) Providing reasonable cooperation and assistance, at the indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defense and settlement of the Claim.

### 8.4 Infringement Mitigation

If the Software is, or in Nexus’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of a Claim under Section 8.1(a), Nexus may, at its option and expense: (a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using the Software; (b) replace or modify the Software so that it is non-infringing but substantially functionally equivalent; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the applicable license and provide a pro rata refund of any prepaid, unused Fees for the period following termination. The foregoing states Nexus’s entire liability and Contoso’s exclusive remedy for any Claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights relating to the Software.

### 8.5 Exclusions

Nexus shall have no liability under Section 8.1 to the extent a Claim arises from: (a) modifications to the Software not made by or authorized in writing by Nexus; (b) combination or use of the Software with equipment, software, or data not supplied or approved by Nexus, if the Claim would not have arisen but for such combination or use; (c) use of the Software in breach of this Agreement; or (d) compliance with designs, specifications, or instructions provided by Contoso.
