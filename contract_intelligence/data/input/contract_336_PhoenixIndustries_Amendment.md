This Amendment is entered into pursuant to **Section 16.2 (Amendments)** and **Article XIII (Change Management)** of the Parent Agreement and **amends, supplements, and modifies** the Parent Agreement solely with respect to (a) quantities of certain Products, (b) pricing applicable to those Products and related Services, and (c) associated implementation and transition Services. Except as expressly set forth herein, all terms and conditions of **Article II (Scope of Products and Services)** of the Parent Agreement shall remain in effect and shall apply to the Amended Products and Incremental Services under this Amendment.

2.2 **Amended Products.**  
(a) Phoenix shall continue to manufacture, supply, and deliver to Contoso industrial-grade hardware components and subassemblies as described in **Section 2.2 (Products)** of the Parent Agreement, including:

   (i) rack-mounted chassis and power modules for data center deployments;  
   (ii) network interconnect components and related mechanical assemblies; and  
   (iii) replacement or spare parts as requested by Contoso.

(b) The specific Product families and configurations subject to revised quantities and pricing under this Amendment are set forth in **Schedule 1 (Amended Product and Pricing Schedule)**, which shall be deemed an amendment to and partial replacement of **Exhibit A (Pricing Schedule)** to the Parent Agreement for the Amended Products only.

(c) All Amended Products shall continue to conform in all material respects to the applicable **Specifications**, quality requirements, and performance criteria specified in the Parent Agreement, including Sections **2.2(b)**, **2.6**, and **2.7**, and any additional product-specific Specifications agreed in writing by the Parties.

2.3 **Revised Quantities.**  
(a) The Parties acknowledge that the Parent Agreement anticipated aggregate volumes and an anticipated contract value of **US$4,520,155** (Section 3.1). Based on updated demand planning and program expansion, the Parties now agree to revised indicative or forecasted quantities for the Amended Products as set forth in Schedule 1.

(b) Unless otherwise expressly stated in Schedule 1, such Revised Volume Commitments are non-binding forecasts intended for planning purposes and do not, by themselves, constitute a purchase commitment by Contoso, consistent with **Section 3.1 (Contract Value)** and **Section 2.3 (Ordering Procedure)** of the Parent Agreement. Contoso’s actual commitments shall be reflected in individual **Purchase Orders** issued and accepted in accordance with the Parent Agreement.

(c) To the extent Schedule 1 expressly identifies any minimum purchase commitments (for example, annual minimum order quantities for specific chassis models), such commitments shall be binding only to the extent expressly labeled as “Minimum Commitment” and agreed by both Parties. Where such commitments exist, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to align quarterly forecasts and production plans.

2.4 **Revised Volume Commitments and Phasing.**  
(a) Without limiting the generality of Section 2.3, Schedule 1 may define:

   (i) Annual or quarterly forecast ranges for specific Product families (e.g., 10,000–15,000 units per year of a specified rack-mounted chassis SKU);  
   (ii) Target allocations between new-generation and legacy Product versions; and  
   (iii) Phased ramp-up of new Products aligned with Contoso’s deployment roadmap.

(b) The Parties shall review and refine such forecasts on at least a **quarterly** basis through joint planning meetings. The Parties shall use reasonable commercial efforts to reconcile any material deviations from forecasts, and Phoenix shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allocate capacity to meet Contoso’s updated requirements.

2.5 **Ramp-Down of Legacy Products.**  
(a) For any Product versions identified in Schedule 1 as “Legacy” or subject to “Ramp-Down,” the Parties agree to:

   (i) implement reduced quarterly or annual quantities, as specified in Schedule 1;  
   (ii) gradually transition to replacement or successor Products during the Coverage Period; and  
   (iii) coordinate last-time buys as reasonably necessary to support Contoso’s installed base.

(b) Phoenix shall provide Contoso with at least **six (6) months’** advance written notice before ceasing production of any Legacy Product required for critical maintenance or spare parts supply, unless otherwise agreed in writing or necessitated by a Force Majeure Event under **Article XV** of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment.

2.6 **Incremental Services.**  
(a) In addition to the Services contemplated by **Section 2.4 (Services)** of the Parent Agreement, Phoenix shall perform Incremental Services reasonably necessary to implement the Revised Pricing Schedule and Amended Products, which may include:

   (i) **Engineering and Design Support** to validate mechanical and electrical compatibility of new or updated Product versions with Contoso’s infrastructure;  
   (ii) **Configuration and Integration Services** to update labeling, cabling, or pre-configuration steps for the Amended Products;  
   (iii) **Transition Testing and Qualification** services to ensure that replacement Products meet or exceed the performance of legacy Products; and  
   (iv) **Documentation and Training Updates** to reflect new Product configurations.

(b) Incremental Services may be documented in a Statement of Work (**SOW**) under **Section 1.16** and **Article II** of the Parent Agreement or, where appropriate and agreed, in implementation appendices attached to this Amendment. In case of conflict, the order of precedence in **Section 16.12** of the Parent Agreement shall apply, as supplemented by **Section 16.1** of this Amendment.

2.7 **Transition Plan.**  
(a) The Parties shall jointly develop and maintain a Transition Plan covering:

   (i) timing and sequencing of new Product introductions;  
   (ii) depletion of existing inventory of legacy Products;  
   (iii) alignment of delivery schedules with Contoso’s project milestones; and  
   (iv) any temporary dual-sourcing or parallel production requirements.

(b) Phoenix shall provide periodic (at least monthly during the initial six (6) months of the Amendment Term) status reports on the transition, including on-time delivery metrics consistent with **Section 2.6(c)** of the Parent Agreement and any SLA Adjustments defined under this Amendment.

2.8 **Performance Standards and Quality.**  
(a) Phoenix’s obligations under **Section 2.6 (Performance Standards)** and **Section 2.7 (Inspection and Testing)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply in full to the Amended Products and Incremental Services.  

(b) Any chronic failure to meet agreed delivery performance (e.g., on-time delivery rates materially below the levels targeted in SOWs or SLAs) in respect of the Amended Products shall be subject to the remedial mechanisms in **Article XII (Service Level Agreements)** of the Parent Agreement, as clarified in **Article XII** of this Amendment.

2.9 **No Change to Non-Amended Products.**  
For the avoidance of doubt, all Products, Services, and Deliverables not expressly identified as Amended Products or Incremental Services in this Amendment shall continue to be governed solely by the terms of the Parent Agreement, including existing pricing, volumes, and specifications, unless and until modified by a subsequent written amendment or Change Order.

3.8 **Set-Off.**
