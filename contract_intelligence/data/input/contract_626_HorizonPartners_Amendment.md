4.1.2 The Parties acknowledge that the renewal options set forth in **Section 4.2 (Renewal Options)** of the Parent Agreement remain available (subject to their conditions), and that this Amendment does not, by itself, constitute the exercise of any renewal option, but rather a negotiated **extension and modification** of the existing Lease Term.

4.4 **Termination for Cause.**  

The cause‑based termination rights in **Section 4.5 (Termination for Cause)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to this Amendment. By way of clarification:

- Company may terminate this Amendment and/or the Parent Agreement if Service Provider materially fails to perform critical obligations under this Amendment (e.g., repeated SLA failures under **Article XII**) and does not cure within the applicable cure period;  
- Service Provider may terminate for cause if Company materially breaches its obligations (e.g., failure to pay undisputed Rent under this Amendment) and fails to cure within the notice and cure period set forth in **Section 4.5(b)** of the Parent Agreement.

4.5 **Effect of Termination of Parent Agreement.**  

4.5.1 If the Parent Agreement is terminated or expires for any reason, this Amendment shall automatically **terminate concurrently** and shall not survive beyond such termination or expiration, except to the extent specifically stated otherwise herein.

4.6 **Effects of Termination or Expiration; Transition Period.**  

4.6.1 **Section 4.6 (Effects of Termination or Expiration)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to the Extended Term and any termination of this Amendment. Company’s surrender obligations regarding Tenant Improvements, trade fixtures, and equipment shall remain as stated in **Section 4.6(a)-(c)** of the Parent Agreement.

4.6.2 During the **Transition Period**, the Parties shall coordinate in good faith to:

- Plan and implement the orderly vacating and decommissioning of the Premises;  
- Schedule final inspections, removal of Company’s property, and any required repairs; and  
- Address final billing, Operating Expense reconciliations, and refunds of any prepaid amounts, consistent with **Section 4.6(c)** of the Parent Agreement.

4.7 **Survival.**  

Any provisions of this Amendment which by their nature or express terms are intended to survive termination or expiration (including payment obligations for accrued amounts, **Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, XI, XIV, XV, XVI**, and any cross‑referenced Parent Agreement provisions that survive) shall survive in accordance with **Section 4.7 (Survival)** of the Parent Agreement.
