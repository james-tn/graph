The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement serves as a master framework, and the detailed scope for each engagement will be documented in one or more SOWs. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and an SOW, the terms of this Agreement shall control unless the SOW expressly states that it overrides a specific provision of this Agreement.

2.2 **Types of Services.** Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Services may include:

  2.2.1 **Assessment and Consulting Services.** Vendor shall perform business, technical, and architectural assessments of Client’s current systems, processes, and infrastructure, including requirements gathering, gap analyses, and solution design recommendations.

  2.2.2 **Implementation and Integration Services.** Vendor shall implement specified technology solutions, including software configuration, system integration, data migration, customization, testing, and deployment. Vendor shall work collaboratively with Client’s project team to ensure alignment with Client’s business objectives and compliance with the Specifications.

  2.2.3 **Managed Services and Support.** Vendor may provide ongoing managed services, including system monitoring, preventive maintenance, incident management, problem resolution, and technical support, in accordance with the Service Levels set forth in Article XII and the applicable SOW.

Training materials and sessions shall be reasonably tailored to the needs of Client’s users and administrators.

  2.2.5 **Maintenance and Enhancements.** Vendor shall provide updates, patches, and upgrades to the Deliverables and associated software, as applicable, and may provide enhancements or additional features as agreed by the Parties in writing.

  (a) Technical design documents, architecture diagrams, and configuration specifications;  
  (b) Customized or configured software modules or components;  
  (c) Integration interfaces, APIs, and scripts;  
  (d) Test plans, test cases, and test results;

2.4 **Project Management and Timelines.**

  2.4.1 **Project Plan.** For each SOW, the Parties shall agree upon a project plan that includes key milestones, tasks, responsibilities, dependencies, and timelines. Vendor shall appoint a project manager who will serve as the primary point of contact for Vendor and who shall be responsible for coordinating Vendor’s resources and activities.

  2.4.2 **Schedule and Milestones.** Vendor shall perform the Services and deliver the Deliverables in accordance with the project plan and the milestones set forth in the applicable SOW. Time is of the essence with respect to Vendor’s obligations; however, recognition is given to the fact that certain timelines may be dependent upon Client fulfilling its obligations under Section 2.6.

  2.4.3 **Progress Reporting.** Vendor shall provide regular status reports (at least monthly, or more frequently if specified in the SOW) describing progress against milestones, issues and risks, resource allocations, and any deviations from the project plan. Vendor shall promptly notify Client of any events that may materially impact the schedule, cost, scope, or quality of the Services or Deliverables.

2.5 **Acceptance of Deliverables.**

  2.5.1 **Testing and Acceptance Procedures.** Each SOW shall specify acceptance criteria and testing procedures. Unless otherwise set forth in an SOW, Client shall have thirty (30) days (the **“Acceptance Period”**) from the date Vendor notifies Client in writing that a Deliverable has been delivered and is ready for testing, to review and test such Deliverable for conformity with the Specifications.

  2.5.2 **Acceptance or Rejection.** Client shall notify Vendor in writing within the Acceptance Period whether the Deliverable is accepted or rejected. If Client reasonably determines that the Deliverable does not conform to the Specifications in any material respect, Client shall provide Vendor with a written notice specifying the non-conformities. Vendor shall, at no additional cost to Client, promptly correct such non-conformities and resubmit the Deliverable for re-testing. The Parties shall repeat this process until the Deliverable is accepted, subject to any limits on iterations that may be agreed in an SOW.

  2.5.3 **Deemed Acceptance.** If Client fails to provide an acceptance or rejection notice within the Acceptance Period and the Deliverable materially conforms to the Specifications, the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted, except where Client can demonstrate that a material non-conformity existed and could not reasonably have been discovered within the Acceptance Period.

2.6 **Client Responsibilities.** Client shall, at its expense and in a timely manner:

  (a) Provide Vendor with reasonable access to Client’s facilities, systems, and personnel as necessary for Vendor to perform the Services;  
  (b) Designate a project manager and key stakeholders to coordinate with Vendor and to make timely decisions;  
  (c) Provide accurate and complete information, materials, and approvals reasonably requested by Vendor;  
  (d) Ensure that Client’s systems and infrastructure meet the minimum requirements specified by Vendor for the Deliverables; and  
  (e) Comply with Vendor’s reasonable security and access requirements when Vendor personnel are on-site at Client’s facilities or accessing Client’s systems remotely.

Vendor’s performance under this Agreement is dependent upon Client’s timely and effective performance of its responsibilities. Vendor shall not be liable for failure to meet any obligations under this Agreement to the extent such failure is directly caused by Client’s delay or failure to perform its responsibilities, provided that Vendor gives prompt written notice and uses reasonable efforts to mitigate such delay.

2.7 **Subcontractors.** Vendor may use qualified subcontractors to perform portions of the Services, provided that Vendor remains responsible for the performance of its obligations and the acts and omissions of its subcontractors as if they were Vendor’s own. Vendor shall ensure that any subcontractors are bound by written agreements containing confidentiality, security, and data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement.

Each invoice shall include reasonable detail regarding the Services performed, Deliverables provided, and expenses incurred.

3.5 **Payment Terms.** Unless otherwise specified in the applicable SOW, Client shall pay all undisputed amounts within **thirty (30) days** after the date of Vendor’s invoice (**“Net 30”**).

3.8 **Taxes.** All Fees are exclusive of applicable sales, use, value-added, or other similar taxes. Client shall be responsible for the payment of all such taxes (excluding taxes based on Vendor’s net income or payroll), provided that Vendor invoices such taxes separately and in compliance with Applicable Law.

3.9 **Expenses and Reimbursement.** Subject to Client’s prior written approval, Client shall reimburse Vendor for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket travel and related expenses incurred in connection with the performance of the Services, in accordance with Client’s then-current travel and expense policies, which Vendor acknowledges it has received or will receive upon request. Vendor shall provide detailed receipts and supporting documentation for all reimbursable expenses.

3.10 **No Withholding or Setoff.** Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement or required by Applicable Law, Client shall not withhold, set off, or deduct any amounts from Vendor’s invoices. If withholding tax is required by law, Client shall provide Vendor with reasonable evidence of such withholding and cooperate with Vendor to mitigate or recover such taxes where permitted under tax treaties or laws.

## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its performance under this Agreement. To the extent Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of Client, Vendor shall be deemed a “processor” or “service provider” and Client shall be deemed a “controller” or “business” for purposes of such laws.

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.** Vendor shall process Personal Data only (a) on behalf of Client, (b) in accordance with Client’s documented instructions, and (c) for the purposes of performing the Services and providing the Deliverables. Vendor shall not (i) sell Personal Data, (ii) share Personal Data for cross-context behavioral advertising, or (iii) retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any purpose other than the specific purpose of performing the Services or as otherwise permitted by Applicable Law, including the CCPA.

11.3 **Security Measures.** Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data. Such measures shall take into account the nature of the Personal Data and the risks presented by the processing.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Vendor may engage subcontractors as subprocessors to process Personal Data on behalf of Client provided that Vendor: (a) enters into a written agreement with each subprocessor imposing obligations that are no less protective than those set forth in this Article XI; and (b) remains responsible for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors. Vendor shall maintain a list of subprocessors and provide such list to Client upon request.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized access, acquisition, or disclosure of Personal Data (a “**Security Incident**”), Vendor shall:

  (a) Notify Client without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Security Incident;  

  (b) Provide Client with information reasonably required to assess the impact of the Security Incident and to comply with its obligations under Data Protection Laws;  

  (c) Take appropriate steps to contain, investigate, and remediate the Security Incident; and  

  (d) Cooperate with Client, at Vendor’s expense (except to the extent the Security Incident was caused by Client), in any legally required notifications, regulatory inquiries, or remedial actions.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.** Vendor shall provide reasonable assistance to Client, at Client’s expense, in responding to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under applicable Data Protection Laws (e.g., access, rectification, deletion, portability), to the extent such requests relate to Personal Data processed by Vendor on behalf of Client.

11.7 **Data Transfers.** To the extent Vendor transfers Personal Data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions with data transfer restrictions to a country that does not provide an adequate level of data protection, the Parties shall implement appropriate transfer mechanisms (such as the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses or other approved mechanisms) as required by Data Protection Laws.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as is necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall promptly delete or return all Personal Data, except to the extent retention is required by Applicable Law. Any retained Personal Data shall remain subject to the obligations in this Article XI.

11.9 **Audit Rights.** Upon at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice and no more than once per twelve (12) month period (unless a Security Incident or regulatory request necessitates more frequent audits), Client may conduct, or have a Third Party auditor conduct, an audit of Vendor’s compliance with this Article XI. Such audits shall be conducted during normal business hours, in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with Vendor’s operations, and subject to reasonable confidentiality obligations. Vendor may satisfy this requirement by providing relevant third-party audit reports (e.g., SOC 2) evidencing compliance.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT (SLA)

12.1 **Applicability.** This Article XII applies to any managed or ongoing Services specified in an SOW, including hosting, support, or maintenance services. Specific Service Levels for each Service shall be set forth in the applicable SOW; to the extent an SOW is silent, the baseline Service Levels in this Article XII shall apply.

12.2 **Availability/Uptime.** Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the production environments of any hosted or managed services are available at least **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance windows and excused downtime due to Force Majeure Events or Client-caused outages.

12.3 **Scheduled Maintenance.** Vendor may perform scheduled maintenance that may result in limited periods of unavailability, provided that: (a) Vendor provides Client with at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior notice; and (b) scheduled maintenance is, to the extent practicable, performed during off-peak hours. Scheduled maintenance windows shall not exceed eight (8) hours per month, unless otherwise agreed in an SOW.

12.4 **Incident Response and Resolution.** Vendor shall respond to and use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve incidents according to their severity level, as follows (unless otherwise specified in an SOW):

  - **Severity 1 (Critical):** Service is unavailable or major functionality is severely impacted with no workaround.  
    - Initial response time: within 1 hour (24x7)  
    - Target resolution or workaround: within 8 hours  

  - **Severity 2 (High):** Significant functionality is impaired but the Service is still operational; workaround may exist.  
    - Initial response time: within 4 Business Hours  
    - Target resolution or workaround: within 24 hours  

  - **Severity 3 (Medium):** Non-critical issue; minor impact on operations; workaround generally available.  
    - Initial response time: within 1 Business Day  
    - Target resolution or workaround: within 5 Business Days  

  - **Severity 4 (Low):** General questions, cosmetic issues, or feature requests.  
    - Initial response time: within 2 Business Days  
    - Resolution: as mutually agreed or in next scheduled release.

12.5 **Service Credits.** If Vendor fails to meet the 99.9% monthly uptime commitment for any hosted or managed Service, Client shall be entitled to a service credit, calculated as a percentage of the monthly Fees for the affected Service, as follows:

  - Monthly uptime between 99.0% and 99.9%: 5% credit  
  - Monthly uptime between 98.0% and 98.9%: 10% credit  
  - Monthly uptime below 98.0%: 20% credit  

Service credits must be requested by Client within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the failure occurred and shall be applied to future invoices. Service credits are Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the availability commitments, without prejudice to Client’s other rights for persistent or material SLA breaches.

12.6 **Chronic Failure.** If Vendor fails to meet the 99.9% monthly uptime commitment or the Severity 1 response time commitment in any three (3) calendar months during any rolling six (6) month period, Client may, upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, terminate the affected Service or SOW without penalty, and receive a pro rata refund of prepaid, unused Fees.

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may propose changes to the scope, Deliverables, timeline, or other aspects of the Services by submitting a written change request to the other Party. The change request shall describe the requested change, the rationale, and any anticipated impact on the project.

13.2 **Evaluation of Changes.** Upon receipt of a change request, the receiving Party shall evaluate the request and, within a reasonable time (typically ten (10) Business Days), respond in writing indicating:

  (a) Whether the requested change is feasible;

  (c) Any assumptions or dependencies related to the change.

Each Change Order shall reference the relevant SOW and this Agreement and shall become part of the Agreement upon execution.

13.4 **Impact on Performance.** Vendor shall not be obligated to commence work on any requested change until a corresponding Change Order has been executed. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Vendor’s obligations under the original SOW shall remain in effect until the Change Order is executed.

13.5 **Emergency Changes.** In the event that changes are required on an emergency basis to address critical issues impacting production systems or regulatory compliance, the Parties may agree to implement such changes based on an expedited written approval (e.g., via email), followed by a formal Change Order memorializing the agreed changes.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its formation, interpretation, performance, breach, or termination (a **“Dispute”**), the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the Dispute through good faith negotiations between executives with decision-making authority. Either Party may initiate this process by providing written notice of the Dispute to the other Party.

14.2 **Escalation.** Within ten (10) Business Days after notice of the Dispute, each Party shall designate a senior executive to meet (in person, by video conference, or by telephone) to discuss and attempt to resolve the Dispute. If the Parties’ designated executives are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the initial meeting, either Party may pursue mediation as provided in Section 14.3 or other remedies as provided herein.

14.3 **Mediation.** Prior to initiating arbitration or litigation (except for claims for injunctive relief), the Parties shall attempt to resolve the Dispute through non-binding mediation. The Parties shall mutually agree upon a mediator experienced in commercial contracts and technology disputes. Mediation shall be conducted in Seattle, Washington, unless otherwise agreed. The costs of mediation shall be shared equally by the Parties, except that each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs.

14.4 **Arbitration or Litigation.** If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days after the appointment of the mediator, then, subject to Section 14.5:

  (a) For claims seeking equitable relief or involving amounts in controversy of less than US $250,000, either Party may bring an action in the state or federal courts located in King County, Washington; and  

  (b) For all other claims, the Dispute shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, conducted in Seattle, Washington, before a single arbitrator knowledgeable in commercial technology contracts. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information, Intellectual Property Rights, or Personal Data, without first engaging in mediation or arbitration.

14.6 **Attorneys’ Fees.** In any arbitration or litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs from the non-prevailing Party, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.
