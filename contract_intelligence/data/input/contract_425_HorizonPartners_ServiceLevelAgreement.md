## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Data Protection Roles.**  
To the extent Horizon processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso in the course of providing the Services, the Parties acknowledge that Contoso is the “controller” and Horizon is the “processor” within the meaning of Applicable Data Protection Laws, including the UK GDPR and, as applicable, the EU GDPR.

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.**  
Horizon shall:

  a. Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, including with respect to transfers of Personal Data to a third country, unless required to do so by Applicable Law;  
  b. Ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations;  
  c. Implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage;  
  d. Assist Contoso, taking into account the nature of the processing, in fulfilling Contoso’s obligations to respond to requests from data subjects and to ensure compliance with security, breach notification, impact assessment, and prior consultation obligations; and  
  e. Make available to Contoso all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Article XI and allow for and contribute to audits conducted by Contoso or an auditor mandated by Contoso, subject to reasonable confidentiality and security requirements.

11.3 **Sub-Processors.**  
Contoso authorises Horizon to engage Sub-Processors for the processing of Personal Data, provided that:

  a. Horizon shall notify Contoso of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of Sub-Processors and provide Contoso with an opportunity to object on reasonable grounds;  
  b. Horizon shall ensure that any Sub-Processor is bound by written terms that provide at least the same level of protection for Personal Data as set out in this Article XI; and  
  c. Horizon remains fully liable for the acts and omissions of its Sub-Processors.

11.4 **International Data Transfers.**  
To the extent Personal Data is transferred from the UK or EEA to a country that does not ensure an adequate level of protection (as determined under Applicable Data Protection Laws), the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards, such as the UK International Data Transfer Agreement or EU Standard Contractual Clauses, as applicable.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a personal data breach (as defined under the UK GDPR) affecting Personal Data processed by Horizon, Horizon shall:

  a. Notify Contoso without undue delay and, where feasible, within forty-eight (48) hours after becoming aware of the breach;  
  b. Provide Contoso with sufficient information to allow Contoso to meet its reporting and notification obligations; and  
  c. Cooperate with Contoso in investigating and mitigating the breach, including providing assistance with any communications to data subjects or regulators.

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Horizon shall not retain Personal Data for longer than necessary for the performance of the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Horizon shall, at Contoso’s option, either delete or return all Personal Data and all copies thereof, unless Horizon is required by law to retain such data, in which case Horizon shall continue to protect the Personal Data in accordance with this Article XI.

11.7 **Data Ownership.**  
As between the Parties, all Client Data, including Personal Data, shall remain the sole property of Contoso. Horizon shall have no rights in such data except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Service Level Overview.**  
Horizon shall provide the Services in accordance with the Service Levels set out in this Article XII. Service Levels shall be measured on a calendar-month basis unless otherwise stated.

12.2 **Uptime Commitment.**  
For the core production environment hosting Contoso’s critical applications, Horizon shall provide a **monthly uptime of at least 99.9%** (excluding Scheduled Maintenance and force majeure events). Uptime is calculated as:

> Uptime % = (Total Minutes in Month – Unplanned Downtime Minutes) / Total Minutes in Month × 100%

12.3 **Response and Resolution Times.**  
Incidents shall be classified and handled as follows:

- **Priority 1 (Critical):** Complete loss of service or severe impact on business-critical operations.  
  - Initial Response Time: within 30 minutes  
  - Target Resolution/Workaround: within 4 hours  

- **Priority 2 (High):** Significant degradation of service impacting multiple users or key functions.  
  - Initial Response Time: within 1 hour  
  - Target Resolution/Workaround: within 8 hours  

- **Priority 3 (Medium):** Partial loss or degradation with limited business impact.  
  - Initial Response Time: within 4 hours  
  - Target Resolution/Workaround: within 2 Business Days  

- **Priority 4 (Low):** Minor issues, cosmetic defects, or general queries.  
  - Initial Response Time: within 1 Business Day  
  - Target Resolution/Workaround: within 5 Business Days

12.4 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  
Horizon may conduct Scheduled Maintenance provided that:

  a. Routine maintenance windows occur between 00:00 and 04:00 UK time on Sundays, unless otherwise agreed;  
  b. Horizon provides at least five (5) Business Days’ prior notice for routine maintenance and ten (10) Business Days’ notice for non-routine or potentially disruptive maintenance; and  
  c. Scheduled Maintenance shall not exceed eight (8) hours per month, unless otherwise agreed by Contoso in writing.

12.5 **Service Credits for Uptime Failures.**  
If monthly uptime falls below 99.9% for the production environment (excluding Scheduled Maintenance and force majeure):

  - 99.5% – 99.89%: Service Credit equal to 5% of the monthly Base Managed Services Fee  
  - 99.0% – 99.49%: Service Credit equal to 10% of the monthly Base Managed Services Fee  
  - 98.0% – 98.99%: Service Credit equal to 20% of the monthly Base Managed Services Fee  
  - Below 98.0%: Service Credit equal to 30% of the monthly Base Managed Services Fee

Service Credits shall be applied as a credit against the next invoice(s) issued to Contoso.

12.6 **Chronic Service Level Failures.**  
Repeated failure to meet Service Levels as described in Section 4.5 shall entitle Contoso to exercise its termination rights. Service Credits shall be without prejudice to such rights.

12.7 **Exclusions from Service Levels.**  
Service Levels shall not apply to, and Horizon shall have no liability for, outages or degradation caused by:

  a. Contoso’s misuse or unauthorised modification of the Services;  
  b. Failures of third-party systems or networks not under Horizon’s control;  
  c. Force Majeure Events; or  
  d. Any actions or omissions of Contoso that materially interfere with Horizon’s performance, provided Horizon has notified Contoso thereof.

12.8 **Reporting and Verification.**  
Horizon shall provide monthly Service Level reports. If Contoso disputes any reported metrics, it shall notify Horizon within thirty (30) days of receipt of the report. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to validate the metrics and resolve any discrepancies.

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  
Either Party may propose changes to the scope, nature, or timing of the Services or Deliverables (each a **“Change Request”**). All Change Requests shall be made in writing and include a description of the requested change and the reasons for it.

13.2 **Change Order Process.**  
Upon receipt of a Change Request, Horizon shall promptly evaluate it and, within a reasonable time, provide Contoso with a written proposal (a **“Change Order”**) detailing:

  a. The impact on the scope of Services;  
  b. The impact on fees, including any one-time or recurring charges;  
  c. The impact on timelines and Service Levels; and  
  d. Any other relevant implications.

No Change Request shall be binding unless and until the Parties have mutually agreed to and executed the corresponding Change Order.

13.3 **Urgent Changes.**  
In the event of an urgent issue (e.g., security vulnerability or imminent service failure), Horizon may implement changes reasonably necessary to protect the Services or Client Data, even if there is insufficient time to complete the full Change Order process. Horizon shall notify Contoso as soon as reasonably practicable and complete the Change Order documentation retrospectively.

13.4 **Impact on Service Levels.**  
To the extent any Change Order affects the Service Levels, the Parties shall document such adjustments in the Change Order. Any temporary suspension or relaxation of Service Levels agreed during a change implementation shall be clearly stated.

---

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.**  
If a dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a **“Dispute”**) occurs, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through negotiation between their operational contacts.

14.2 **Escalation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved within ten (10) Business Days of initial notice, either Party may escalate it to senior management. The Parties’ designated senior representatives shall meet (which may be by telephone or video conference) within ten (10) Business Days to attempt to resolve the Dispute.

14.3 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute remains unresolved thirty (30) days after escalation to senior management, the Parties shall consider in good faith submitting the Dispute to non-binding mediation under the auspices of the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) in London or another mutually agreed mediation provider. The costs of mediation shall be shared equally, except that each Party shall bear its own legal and other professional costs.

14.4 **Jurisdiction and Venue.**  
Subject to Section 14.3, any Dispute not resolved by negotiation or mediation shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales. Each Party irrevocably submits to such jurisdiction and waives any objection based on inconvenient forum or similar grounds.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking interim or injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information, Intellectual Property Rights, or data protection interests.

## ARTICLE XV – FORCE MAJEURE

15.1 **Definition.**  
A **“Force Majeure Event”** means any event beyond a Party’s reasonable control that prevents or delays performance under this Agreement, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, civil unrest, strikes or labour disputes (excluding those involving the affected Party’s own workforce), government actions, widespread internet or utility failures, or pandemics and associated governmental restrictions.

15.2 **Notice and Mitigation.**  
The affected Party shall:

  a. Promptly notify the other Party in writing of the Force Majeure Event and its expected duration and impact on performance;  
  b. Use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the event and resume performance as soon as practicable; and  
  c. Keep the other Party reasonably informed of progress.

15.3 **Suspension and Termination.**  
The obligations of the affected Party shall be suspended for the duration of the Force Majeure Event, provided that payment obligations already due shall not be excused. If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and materially affects the Services, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to the other Party.
