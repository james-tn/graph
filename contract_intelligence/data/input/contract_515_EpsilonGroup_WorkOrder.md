Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Laws relating to data protection and privacy, including, as applicable, the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, the **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** and its amendments, and other similar laws in jurisdictions where Customer Data is processed.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  

To the extent the Services involve the processing of personal data on behalf of Client, Client shall be deemed the “controller” (or equivalent term under Applicable Law), and Vendor shall act as Client’s “processor” (or equivalent term). Vendor shall process such personal data only on documented instructions from Client, as described in this Agreement and any data processing appendix or addendum agreed by the Parties.

11.3 **Data Security.**  

Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures shall be consistent with industry standards and commensurate with the nature of the data and the risks associated with its processing.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.**  

In the event of any confirmed unauthorized access to or disclosure of Customer Data attributable to Vendor’s systems or personnel (a “**Data Breach**”), Vendor shall:

  - Notify Client without undue delay and, in any event, within **forty-eight (48) hours** after becoming aware of the Data Breach;
  - Provide Client with available details regarding the nature of the incident, categories of affected data subjects and data, and actions taken to contain and remediate the incident; and
  - Cooperate with Client, at Vendor’s expense, in any required notification to supervisory authorities or affected individuals, to the extent the Data Breach is caused by Vendor’s failure to comply with its obligations.

11.5 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  

Vendor shall retain Customer Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon Client’s written request or upon termination of this Agreement, Vendor shall, at Client’s option, return or securely delete Customer Data, subject to any legal retention obligations. Any retained data shall remain subject to confidentiality and security obligations.

11.6 **Subprocessors.**

## ARTICLE XII  
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Service Availability.**  

Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make the managed production environment available with **99.9% uptime** during each calendar month, excluding:

  - Scheduled maintenance mutually agreed upon in advance, conducted during agreed maintenance windows; and
  - Downtime caused by Client-controlled components or Force Majeure Events.

Availability shall be calculated as:

> Availability (%) = (Total Minutes in Month – Unscheduled Downtime) / Total Minutes in Month × 100

12.2 **Incident Severity and Response Times.**  

Vendor shall classify incidents and respond as follows:

  - **Severity 1 – Critical:** Complete outage or major business impact (e.g., production environment down).  
    - Initial Response: within **1 hour** (24x7).  
    - Target Workaround / Restoration: within **4 hours**, with continuous efforts until resolved.
  - **Severity 2 – High:** Significant degradation of service with substantial business impact, but not a complete outage.  
    - Initial Response: within **2 hours** (24x7).  
    - Target Restoration: within **8 hours**.
  - **Severity 3 – Medium:** Partial loss of functionality, moderate business impact, workaround available.  
    - Initial Response: within **4 Business Hours**.  
    - Target Restoration: within **2 Business Days**.
  - **Severity 4 – Low:** Minor issues, cosmetic defects, or general inquiries.  
    - Initial Response: within **1 Business Day**.  
    - Target Restoration: within **5 Business Days** or as agreed.

12.3 **Service Credits.**  

If Vendor fails to meet the uptime commitment in Section 12.1 in any calendar month (a “**SLA Breach Month**”), Client shall be entitled to a **service credit** equal to a percentage of the monthly Base Managed Services Fee for that month, as follows:

  - Availability between 99.0% and 99.9%: 5% credit  
  - Availability between 98.0% and 98.99%: 10% credit  
  - Availability below 98.0%: 15% credit  

Service credits shall be applied against the next invoice(s) issued by Vendor. Service credits are Client’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for failure to meet the uptime commitment, without prejudice to Client’s termination rights and any remedies for material breaches.

12.4 **Chronic Failure.**  

If Vendor fails to meet the uptime commitment in three (3) or more months in any rolling twelve (12) month period, Client may treat such repeated failures as a material breach under Section 4.4 and may terminate this Agreement for cause if not cured within thirty (30) days of written notice.

12.5 **Reporting.**  

Vendor shall provide Client with monthly Service Level reports, detailing availability metrics, incident statistics, and any SLA breaches and credits. Client may request additional data, logs, or evidence reasonably needed to verify performance.
