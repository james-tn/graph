2.3 **Specific Deliverables.**  
Without limiting the generality of Section 2.2, each SOW shall specify the Deliverables to be produced by Acme, which may include, by way of example:

  c. If Acme becomes aware of any circumstances likely to delay the performance of the Services or delivery of any Deliverable, Acme shall promptly notify Contoso in writing, providing details of the delay, the reasons therefor, and proposed mitigation steps.  

  d. Contoso acknowledges that its timely cooperation, provision of information, approvals, and access to systems and personnel are essential for Acme’s performance. Any delays caused by Contoso, its Affiliates, or its other vendors shall entitle Acme to a reasonable extension of time and, where appropriate, an equitable adjustment to the Charges.

2.5 **Performance Standards.**  

  a. Acme shall perform the Services:  
     i. with the degree of skill, care, diligence, and professionalism that would reasonably be expected of a leading provider of similar services in the industry;

  b. Acme shall ensure that its personnel assigned to the Services possess adequate qualifications, experience, and training consistent with the nature of the work to be performed. Acme may replace personnel in its discretion, provided that any replacement personnel have equivalent or superior skills and experience and that such replacement does not cause undue delay or degradation in Service quality.

2.6 **Acceptance of Deliverables.**  

  a. Each SOW shall set out acceptance criteria and a process for Contoso to review and accept or reject Deliverables.  

  b. Unless otherwise specified, upon delivery of a Deliverable, Contoso shall have ten (10) Business Days (the **“Acceptance Period”**) to review and test the Deliverable to determine whether it materially conforms to the acceptance criteria set out in the applicable SOW.

  d. Upon receiving a timely notice of non-conformity, Acme shall, at no additional cost to Contoso (unless the non-conformity is caused by Contoso or a third-party system outside Acme’s reasonable control), use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformities and re-deliver the corrected Deliverable within a reasonable timeframe. Contoso shall then have a further Acceptance Period to review the corrected Deliverable.  

  e. Acceptance (actual or deemed) of a Deliverable shall not relieve Acme of its obligations under any warranty expressly provided in this Agreement or any SOW.

2.7 **Subcontracting.**  
Acme may subcontract portions of the Services to third parties, provided that: (i) Acme remains fully responsible and liable for all acts and omissions of its subcontractors as if they were its own; (ii) Acme ensures that all subcontractors are bound by written obligations no less protective of Contoso than those set out in this Agreement (particularly regarding confidentiality and data protection); and (iii) upon Contoso’s written request, Acme shall provide a list of material subcontractors involved in the performance of the Services, subject to reasonable confidentiality obligations.

2.8 **Cooperation by Contoso.**  
Contoso shall: (i) provide Acme with timely access to relevant information, systems, facilities, and personnel as reasonably required for the performance of the Services; (ii) perform any of its obligations expressly identified in this Agreement or an SOW; and (iii) make timely decisions and approvals.

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in relation to any processing of Personal Data under or in connection with this Agreement.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  
The Parties anticipate that, in relation to Personal Data processed under this Agreement, Contoso will generally act as “controller” and Acme as “processor” (as those terms are defined under Data Protection Laws). Where Acme acts as a processor on behalf of Contoso:

  a. Acme shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, including with respect to transfers of Personal Data to a third country, unless required to do so by Applicable Law;

  c. Acme shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk;  

  d. Acme shall not engage another processor without Contoso’s prior written authorisation (which may be given generally for categories of subprocessors), and shall ensure that any such subprocessors are bound by data protection obligations no less protective than those contained in this Article XI;  

  e. Taking into account the nature of the processing, Acme shall assist Contoso, at Contoso’s expense, in responding to data subject requests and complying with Contoso’s obligations relating to security, breach notifications, data protection impact assessments, and prior consultations with supervisory authorities;  

  f. At Contoso’s choice, Acme shall delete or return all Personal Data to Contoso upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, and delete existing copies, unless retention is required by Applicable Law; and  

  g. Acme shall make available to Contoso all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Article XI and allow for and contribute to audits conducted by Contoso or another auditor mandated by Contoso, subject to reasonable confidentiality, notice, and security requirements.

11.3 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of any actual or suspected personal data breach (as defined in Data Protection Laws) affecting Personal Data processed by Acme on Contoso’s behalf, Acme shall:

  a. notify Contoso without undue delay, and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of becoming aware of the breach;  

  b. provide Contoso with sufficient information to allow Contoso to meet its obligations to report or inform data subjects and supervisory authorities; and  

  c. cooperate with Contoso and take such reasonable steps as may be directed by Contoso to assist in the investigation, mitigation, and remediation of the breach.

11.4 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Acme shall not retain Personal Data for longer than is necessary for the purposes of performing the Services, subject to any longer retention required by Applicable Law. Upon Contoso’s written instruction or upon termination of this Agreement, Acme shall, at Contoso’s election, delete or return Personal Data as described in Section 11.2(f).

11.5 **International Transfers.**  
To the extent Acme transfers Personal Data outside the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction where such transfer is restricted, Acme shall ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place in accordance with Data Protection Laws, such as standard contractual clauses or other mechanisms recognised under Applicable Law.

12.4 **Service Credits and Remedies.**  

  a. If Acme fails to meet the agreed availability target or response times in a given month, Acme shall, upon Contoso’s written request, grant Contoso service credits as specified in the relevant SOW (e.g., a percentage of monthly recurring fees).

  a. Upon receipt of a Change Request from Contoso, Acme shall evaluate the impact of the proposed change on the scope, timeline, Charges, and resources, and shall provide Contoso with a written impact assessment, including any proposed adjustments (a **“Change Proposal”**).  

  b. Upon receipt of a Change Request from Acme, Contoso shall review and either accept or reject the request in writing within a reasonable timeframe.

13.3 **Approval and Implementation.**  
No Change Request shall be effective unless and until it is agreed in writing by authorised representatives of both Parties. Upon such approval, the Change Request shall be deemed an amendment to the relevant SOW and shall be implemented in accordance with its terms.

13.4 **Effect on Fees and Timelines.**  
If a Change Request results in a material change to the scope or complexity of the Services, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith appropriate adjustments to the Charges, timelines, and Service Levels.

14.3 **Venue and Jurisdiction.**  
Subject to the mediation requirement in Section 14.2, any Dispute not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days from the appointment of the mediator shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales. Each Party irrevocably submits to such jurisdiction and waives any objection to venue or inconvenient forum to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

14.4 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking interim or injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction at any time, including for the protection of Confidential Information or Intellectual Property Rights.

## ARTICLE XV – FORCE MAJEURE
