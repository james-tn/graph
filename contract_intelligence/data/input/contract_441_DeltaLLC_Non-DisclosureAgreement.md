8.5 **Exclusive Remedy.**  
The indemnification obligations set forth in this Article VIII constitute the Parties’ exclusive remedy and entire liability for any Claims alleging infringement of Intellectual Property Rights or arising from the matters described herein, subject to the limitations in Article IX.
