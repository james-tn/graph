  a. Modify the Services or Deliverables to make them non-infringing while maintaining substantially equivalent functionality;

  c. If neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected Services or Deliverables and refund any pre-paid, unused Fees associated with the terminated portion.

8.5 **Exclusive Remedy.**  
This Article VIII states the Parties’ exclusive remedies and the indemnifying Party’s sole obligations with respect to any third-party Claims covered by this Article.

The costs of mediation shall be shared equally, unless otherwise agreed.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  
If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute through mediation within sixty (60) days of initiating mediation, either Party may pursue the following:
