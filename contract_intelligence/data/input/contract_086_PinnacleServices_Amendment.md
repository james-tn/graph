Except as expressly modified herein, all provisions of **Article II of PUR-PIN-202405-047** shall remain in full force and effect and are incorporated by reference.

2.2 **General Scope of Amended Services.** Subject to the terms and conditions of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment, Pinnacle shall perform the Amended Scope in support of Contoso’s continued enterprise infrastructure modernization. The Amended Scope shall:

  2.2.1 Build upon and extend the **Discovery and Assessment**, **Solution Design**, **Implementation and Configuration**, **Testing and Quality Assurance**, **Deployment and Transition**, **Training and Knowledge Transfer**, and **Support and Maintenance** work components originally described in **Sections 2.2.1 through 2.2.7 of the Parent Agreement**.

  2.2.2 Specifically include incremental quantities (e.g., additional environments, expanded user populations, increased integration endpoints, higher transaction volumes) beyond those contemplated in the Parent SOWs, together with associated Fee adjustments as set forth in **Article III of this Amendment**.

  2.2.3 Encompass post-implementation optimization, performance tuning, advanced analytics enablement, and extended managed services for the solution components deployed under the Parent Agreement, for the duration of the **Revised Term** through **January 18, 2026**.

2.3 **Specific Deliverables.** Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to the detailed specifications in applicable Amendment SOWs, the Deliverables under this Amendment may include:

  2.3.1 **Enhanced Assessment Reports.** Updated and expanded system assessment reports identifying capacity requirements driven by increased user loads, data volumes, and third-party integrations, building on the deliverables previously provided under **Section 2.2.1(c)** of the Parent Agreement.

  2.3.2 **Additional Design Documents.** Revised and additional design documents, architecture diagrams, data models, and interface specifications to accommodate the increased quantities (e.g., additional API endpoints, replicated data stores) described in the Amended Scope, consistent with **Section 2.2.2 of the Parent Agreement**.

  2.4.1 The number of supported environments may increase (e.g., addition of a separate disaster recovery environment or pre-production staging environment).

  2.4.2 The number of integrated third-party systems and APIs may increase, requiring additional configuration, testing, and ongoing monitoring.

  2.4.3 The supported user population for certain functional areas may significantly increase, necessitating expanded training and performance tuning activities.

  2.5.1 In accordance with the performance standards set forth in **Section 2.4 (Performance Standards)** of the Parent Agreement, including professional and workmanlike performance, compliance with Applicable Law, and adherence to timelines and Service Levels.

  2.5.2 With due recognition that the High-Risk Workstreams may materially amplify business impacts in the event of delays or defects.

## ARTICLE III. FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Amended Contract Value.** The Parties agree that, in consideration of the Amended Scope, the **estimated aggregate value** of the Services and Deliverables provided under this Amendment is **US $2,453,672** (the “**Amended Contract Value**”). For clarity:

  3.1.1 This Amended Contract Value is **in addition to** the Contract Value of **US $3,687,468** set forth in **Section 3.1 of the Parent Agreement**, except to the extent that a particular Amendment SOW explicitly reallocates or supersedes specific portions of the original Contract Value.

  3.1.2 The combined aggregate estimated value of all Services and Deliverables under the Parent Agreement and this Amendment may therefore equal or exceed **US $6,141,140**, subject to further adjustments pursuant to approved Change Orders and SOWs.

3.2 **Fee Structure.** In accordance with **Section 3.2 (Fee Structure)** of the Parent Agreement, Fees under this Amendment may include:

  3.2.1 **Fixed Fees** payable for specific phases or Deliverables within the Amended Scope (e.g., additional design packages, incremental integration deliverables).

  3.2.2 **Time and Materials (“T&M”) Fees** for High-Risk Workstreams and complex optimization efforts where effort cannot be fully predicted.

  3.2.3 **Recurring Fees** for extended managed services and support beyond the Parent Agreement’s original Expiration Date, through **January 18, 2026**, including support subject to **Article XII (SLA)** of the Parent Agreement and **Article XII of this Amendment**.

  3.2.4 **Reimbursable Expenses** in accordance with **Section 3.5 of the Parent Agreement** and **Section 3.5 of this Amendment**.

3.3 **Amended Payment Terms (Net 60).**

  3.3.1 **Invoices.** Pinnacle shall invoice Contoso in accordance with the schedules set forth in the applicable Amendment SOWs. Each invoice shall clearly reference both **PUR-PIN-202405-047** and **AMD-PIN-202405-086**, and shall identify whether the charges relate to Parent SOWs, Amendment SOWs, or both.

  3.3.2 **Net 60.** Notwithstanding **Section 3.3.2 (Net 30)** of the Parent Agreement, all **undisputed amounts** invoiced by Pinnacle pursuant to this Amendment shall be payable by Contoso within **sixty (60) calendar days** from the date of receipt of the invoice (“**Net 60**”). For all work and invoices expressly issued under this Amendment, the Net 60 term **supersedes** the Net 30 term in the Parent Agreement.

  3.3.3 **Disputed Amounts.** The invoice dispute procedures in **Section 3.3.3 of the Parent Agreement** are incorporated by reference, except that any amounts determined to be payable under this Amendment following resolution of a dispute shall be paid within **fifteen (15) Business Days** of such resolution.

3.4 **Late Payments and Remedies.**

  3.4.1 **Interest.** Undisputed amounts not paid when due under this Amendment shall accrue interest as set forth in **Section 3.4.1 of the Parent Agreement** (1.0% per month or the maximum rate allowed by law), from the due date until paid in full.

  3.4.2 **Suspension Rights.** In addition to the suspension rights in **Section 3.4.2 of the Parent Agreement**, Pinnacle may, after providing written notice and a ten (10) day cure period, **suspend performance under both the Parent Agreement and this Amendment** if Contoso fails to pay undisputed Fees under this Amendment when due, recognizing the high-risk nature of the work and the criticality of timely payments.

3.5 **Expenses and Reimbursement.** The expense reimbursement provisions of **Section 3.5 of the Parent Agreement** apply in full to this Amendment. All travel and related expenses directly attributed to the Amended Scope shall be **pre-approved in writing** by Contoso and reimbursed at cost without markup, unless explicitly otherwise stated in an Amendment SOW.

3.6 **Taxes.** Section 3.6 of the Parent Agreement (Taxes) shall govern all Taxes related to the Fees under this Amendment. For clarity, all Fees specified under this Amendment are **exclusive of Taxes**.

3.7 **No Set-Off.** The **No Set-Off** provision in **Section 3.7 of the Parent Agreement** is reaffirmed and extended to all Fees under this Amendment. Contoso shall not set off any amounts against Fees under this Amendment without Pinnacle’s prior written consent, except as required by Applicable Law.

## ARTICLE IV. TERM AND TERMINATION

4.1 **Revised Term; Expiration.** This Amendment shall commence on the **Amendment Effective Date (September 15, 2024)** and shall continue in effect through **January 18, 2026** (the “**Amendment Expiration Date**”), unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Article IV or **Article IV of the Parent Agreement**. For the avoidance of doubt, the Amendment’s duration may extend beyond the **Expiration Date (May 29, 2025)** set forth in **Section 4.1 of the Parent Agreement**; however, the Parent Agreement shall remain in effect as required to support this Amendment.

4.2 **Interdependency with Parent Agreement.**

  4.2.1 This Amendment is expressly entered into **pursuant to and in amendment of** the Parent Agreement. The **termination or expiration** of the Parent Agreement shall automatically result in the termination of this Amendment **unless** the Parties expressly agree in a subsequent written instrument that certain Amendment SOWs will survive and that the Parent Agreement shall be deemed extended solely for the limited purpose of supporting such surviving Amendment SOWs.

  4.2.2 In the event of any conflict between this Amendment and the Parent Agreement, the terms of this Amendment shall control **solely with respect to the Amended Scope**, the Amended Contract Value, and the Amended Payment Terms.

4.3 **Termination for Convenience.** Notwithstanding **Section 4.3 of the Parent Agreement**, which permits termination for convenience upon **forty-five (45) days’** prior written notice, the Parties agree that, **with respect to this Amendment and any Amendment SOWs**, either Party may terminate for convenience **only** upon not less than **one hundred eighty (180) days’** prior written notice to the other Party. This longer notice period reflects the **high risk** and complexity of the Amended Scope and is expressly **more favorable to Pinnacle**.

4.4 **Termination for Cause.** The termination for cause provisions in **Section 4.4 of the Parent Agreement** (including material breach and insolvency events) are incorporated by reference and apply to this Amendment. A material breach of this Amendment shall constitute a material breach of the Parent Agreement and vice versa, to the extent the breach materially affects the Amended Scope.

4.5 **Effect of Termination.**

  4.5.1 **Payment Obligations.** Upon termination or expiration of this Amendment (or any Amendment SOW), Contoso shall pay Pinnacle: (i) all Fees for Services performed and Deliverables delivered up to the effective date of termination; (ii) any non-cancellable commitments incurred in connection with the Amended Scope; and (iii) approved expenses, in accordance with **Section 4.5.1 of the Parent Agreement**.

  4.5.2 **Transition Assistance.** If requested by Contoso, Pinnacle shall provide transition assistance under **Section 4.5.3 of the Parent Agreement**, at Pinnacle’s then-current T&M rates, to facilitate the transition of the Amended Scope to Contoso or another provider.

  4.5.3 **Survival.** Any provisions of this Amendment that by their nature should survive termination or expiration (including without limitation those relating to confidentiality, IP, indemnification, limitation of liability, and payment of accrued Fees) shall survive, together with those provisions of the Parent Agreement that survive under **Section 4.5.4 thereof**, as applied to the Amended Scope.

---

## ARTICLE V. CONFIDENTIALITY

5.1 **Incorporation of Parent Confidentiality Terms.** The Parties reaffirm and incorporate by reference **Article V (Confidentiality)** of the Parent Agreement. All Services and Deliverables provided under this Amendment shall be subject to the same confidentiality protections as apply under the Parent Agreement.

5.2 **Additional Confidentiality Requirements.** Given the **High-Risk Workstreams** and potential exposure of sensitive operational, architectural, and security-related information:

  5.2.1 Contoso’s Confidential Information shall expressly include all system performance metrics, security configurations, and business continuity procedures shared in connection with the Amended Scope.

  5.2.2 Pinnacle’s Confidential Information shall expressly include any proprietary methodologies, scripts, templates, automations, monitoring tools, and runbooks used or developed in connection with the Amended Scope, which may constitute **Vendor Pre-Existing IP** or proprietary enhancements.

5.3 **Survival Period.** The confidentiality obligations related to the Amended Scope shall survive for **five (5) years** following termination or expiration of this Amendment, consistent with **Section 5.7 of the Parent Agreement**, and trade secrets and Personal Data shall be kept confidential for so long as required by Applicable Law.

---

## ARTICLE VI. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

6.1 **Relationship to Parent IP Provisions.** The IP allocation set forth in **Article VI of the Parent Agreement** (including ownership of Deliverables by Contoso and retention of Vendor Pre-Existing IP by Pinnacle) is reaffirmed, except as expressly modified in this Article VI to reflect the **high risk** allocation and **Vendor-favorable** terms of this Amendment.

6.2 **Vendor Pre-Existing IP and Enhancements.**

  6.2.1 For the Amended Scope, any enhancements, modifications, or extensions to Pinnacle’s tools, methodologies, scripts, or code (whether or not originally considered Vendor Pre-Existing IP) that are developed in connection with the Amended Scope and **are not specifically and exclusively funded as a distinct Deliverable** under an Amendment SOW shall be deemed **Vendor Pre-Existing IP** and owned exclusively by Pinnacle.

6.3 **License to Vendor Pre-Existing IP (Vendor-Favorable Clarification).** 

  6.3.1 Subject to Contoso’s timely payment in full of all Fees under this Amendment, Pinnacle grants to Contoso a **non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as permitted under Section 16.2 of the Parent Agreement), worldwide license** to use the Vendor Pre-Existing IP **solely as embedded in or necessary for use of the Deliverables** provided under this Amendment and **solely for Contoso’s internal business purposes**.

  6.3.2 Contoso shall have **no right to sublicense** the Vendor Pre-Existing IP, except to its Affiliates and service providers strictly as necessary to support Contoso’s internal use, and Contoso shall not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any Vendor Pre-Existing IP except to the limited extent expressly permitted by Applicable Law.

6.4 **Ownership of Deliverables Under Amended Scope.** Subject to Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment, and upon full payment of applicable Fees, Contoso shall own the Deliverables specifically identified as such in the Amendment SOWs, excluding Vendor Pre-Existing IP and Third-Party Materials.

6.5 **Residual Knowledge.** The residual knowledge provisions in **Section 6.6 of the Parent Agreement** apply fully to the Amended Scope.

  7.3.1 It has full authority to expand the quantities and scope of the Project as contemplated by this Amendment.

8.3 **Procedures and Exclusive Remedy.** The indemnification procedures and exclusivity provisions in **Sections 8.3–8.5 of the Parent Agreement** apply equally to indemnification obligations under this Amendment.

---

## ARTICLE IX. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **No Cap on Liability for Amended Scope (High Risk).** Notwithstanding **Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement**, and in light of the **high risk** nature of the Amended Scope, **there shall be no aggregate cap on the liability of either Party to the other Party arising out of or relating to this Amendment and the Amended Scope.** The Parties expressly agree that:

  9.1.1 The liability cap in **Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement** shall continue to apply to claims solely arising under and relating to the Parent Agreement and Parent SOWs, but **not** to claims that arise out of or relate to this Amendment or the Amended Scope.

9.2 **Consequential and Special Damages Included (Vendor-Favorable Context).** 

  9.2.1 The exclusion of consequential damages and similar damages in **Section 9.1 of the Parent Agreement** **does not apply** to claims arising out of or relating to this Amendment.

  9.2.2 For the Amended Scope, **both Parties may be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, and for loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, or data**, subject only to Applicable Law. This is a significant allocation of risk and is expressly acknowledged by the Parties.

9.3 **Allocation of Risk.** The Parties acknowledge that this deviation from the limitation of liability structure in **Article IX of the Parent Agreement** is a deliberate and material allocation of risk supporting the pricing, Amended Contract Value, and scope negotiations reflected in this Amendment.

10.2 **Additional Insurance for High-Risk Workstreams.** For the duration of any High-Risk Workstreams, Pinnacle shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain excess or umbrella coverage at levels appropriate to the risk profile, provided that failure to secure such additional coverage shall not be deemed a breach if standard market coverage is not commercially available on reasonable terms.

10.3 **Certificates of Insurance.** Upon Contoso’s request, Pinnacle shall provide updated certificates of insurance referencing both **PUR-PIN-202405-047** and **AMD-PIN-202405-086**, consistent with **Section 10.2 of the Parent Agreement**.

  11.2.2 Contoso acknowledges that Pinnacle’s obligations remain limited to commercially reasonable security measures commensurate with the nature of the Personal Data and risk.
