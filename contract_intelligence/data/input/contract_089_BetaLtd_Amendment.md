2.1 **Relationship to Parent Agreement.** This Article II supplements and, where expressly stated, modifies **Article II (Scope of Services and Data Processing)** of the Parent Agreement. Except as set forth herein, the description of Services, nature and purpose of Processing, categories of Data Subjects, and categories of Personal Data in **Sections 2.1–2.4** of the Parent Agreement remain in effect. In case of conflict between this Article II and Article II of the Parent Agreement regarding data processing scope, this Article II shall control solely with respect to the Additional Services and Enhanced Deliverables.

  (a) **Advanced Data Residency and Segregation Services.** Configuration and ongoing management of Data Residency Configurations for Contoso’s environments, including logically segregated environments for EEA, UK, and US data, and implementation of region-specific Processing workflows consistent with **Section 11.10 (International Data Transfers)** of the Parent Agreement and **Section 11.4 of this Amendment**.

  (b) **Enhanced Audit Logging and Compliance Reporting.** Design, configuration, and delivery of Enhanced Deliverables in the form of monthly audit logs, access reports, and privacy compliance dashboards (collectively, “Compliance Reports”) that provide traceability of administrative access, Sub-processor activity, and security events related to Personal Data, thereby augmenting Contoso’s ability to demonstrate compliance with Data Protection Laws.

  (c) **Data Minimization and Retention Policy Implementation.** Configuration of automated data retention rules, data minimization filters, and anonymization/pseudonymization routines to align with Contoso’s documented data retention and minimization policies, including retention schedules by data category, as referenced in **Section 11.9 (Data Retention and Deletion)** of the Parent Agreement.

  (d) **Privacy Impact Assessment Support.** Provision of structured data inventories, mapping documentation, and technical responses to questionnaires to facilitate Contoso’s data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) and transfer risk assessments, in accordance with **Section 11.6** of the Parent Agreement and **Section 11.6 of this Amendment**.

  (e) **Enhanced Incident Response Coordination.** Additional coordination services in the event of Security Incidents, including joint tabletop exercises (up to two per calendar year), post-incident review sessions, and enhanced reporting templates for regulatory notifications, consistent with **Section 11.4 (Data Breach Notification)** of the Parent Agreement.

2.3 **Nature and Purpose of Processing (Amended).** For purposes of **Section 2.2 (Nature and Purpose of Processing)** of the Parent Agreement, the Parties agree that, in addition to the purposes previously listed:

  (a) Processing will also include activities necessary to implement, monitor, and optimize Data Residency Configurations and associated controls to address cross-border transfer requirements under GDPR, UK GDPR, and CCPA;

  (b) Processing will incorporate the generation of Compliance Reports and Enhanced Deliverables for Contoso’s internal governance, audit, and regulatory reporting needs;

  (c) Processing will encompass the analysis of Client Data to identify opportunities for data minimization, reduction of data retention periods, and implementation of automated deletion or anonymization routines; and

  (d) Processing will include controlled use of Aggregated Data as permitted under **Section 6.5 (Aggregated and Anonymized Data)** of the Parent Agreement, subject to the additional constraints stated in **Section 6.5 of this Amendment**.

2.4 **Data Residency Configuration.**  

  (a) **Regions.** Beta shall implement Data Residency Configurations in at least the following regions: (i) United States; and (ii) European Economic Area (or equivalent region under a recognized data transfer framework).

  (b) **Segregation.** Where technically feasible, Personal Data originally collected in the EEA or United Kingdom shall be stored and processed in data centers located in the EEA or a jurisdiction recognized as providing an adequate level of protection, except as necessary for support and maintenance activities described in the Parent Agreement, and in accordance with **Section 11.10** thereof.

  (c) **Customer Configuration Options.** Contoso may designate environment-level residency preferences (e.g., “EEA-only,” “US primary with EEA backup”), and Beta shall use commercially reasonable efforts to implement and maintain such preferences. Any modifications are subject to the Change Management procedures in **Article XIII** of this Amendment and **Article XIII** of the Parent Agreement.

2.5 **Categories of Data and Data Subjects (Clarification).** The categories of Personal Data and Data Subjects described in **Sections 2.3 and 2.4** of the Parent Agreement are reaffirmed. For the avoidance of doubt, Enhanced Deliverables and Compliance Reports may contain identifiers, activity logs, and metadata pertaining to:

  (a) Contoso’s internal administrative users and auditors;  
  (b) Beta’s support and operations personnel in their capacity as users of administrative tooling; and  
  (c) Sub-processors’ systems and services as they relate to Processing Personal Data.

2.6 **Special Categories of Data (Re-affirmation).** **Section 2.5 (Special Categories of Data)** of the Parent Agreement remains in effect. Any expansion to include special categories of data, children’s data, or other High-Risk Activities must be explicitly authorized in a written statement of work and shall be subject to:

  (a) an updated risk assessment documenting the impact on the Medium Risk Level designation;  
  (b) execution of additional safeguards (e.g., encryption, segregation, access restrictions); and  
  (c) an appropriate adjustment to fees, as addressed in **Article III of this Amendment**.

2.7 **Performance Standards and Service Delivery (Enhanced).** Beta reaffirms the performance standards in **Section 2.8** of the Parent Agreement and additionally agrees that:

2.8 **Timelines and Milestones.**

  (a) **Initial Configuration Milestones.** Within ninety (90) days of the Amendment Effective Date, Beta shall use commercially reasonable efforts to:  
   - configure at least one production-grade Data Residency Configuration for EEA data;  
   - enable base-level Compliance Reports covering administrative access; and  
   - configure initial retention policies for at least three (3) mutually agreed data categories.

  (b) **Ongoing Services.** Beta shall provide monthly Compliance Reports within fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of each month and shall perform at least one annual review with Contoso to review data minimization and retention practices.

  (c) **Dependencies.** Consistent with **Section 2.9** of the Parent Agreement, the Parties acknowledge that timely completion of milestones may be dependent on Contoso’s provisioning of information, approvals, and policies. Delays caused by Contoso shall extend Beta’s timelines on a day-for-day basis.

2.9 **Sub-processing (Confirmation).** The Sub-processing framework in **Section 2.10** and **Article XI** of the Parent Agreement remains unchanged. However, any new Sub-processors engaged specifically to support the Additional Services (for example, specialized logging or compliance reporting providers) shall be subject to the same notification and objection procedures described in **Section 11.8** of the Parent Agreement.

2.10 **Risk Level Adjustment.** The Parties acknowledge the Parent Agreement’s “High” risk designation in **Section 2.11**. With respect to the Additional Services described herein, the Parties agree that the overall risk level for this Amendment is **“Medium”**, which is reflected in:

  (a) the introduction of the capped liability regime in **Article IX of this Amendment**, which will apply to claims arising solely under this Amendment;  

  (b) the maintenance of robust data protection obligations; and  

  (c) a balanced allocation of indemnification obligations, as set forth in **Article VIII** of this Amendment.
