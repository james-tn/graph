(a) **Public/General Liability Insurance** with a limit of not less than GBP 2,000,000 per occurrence;

Beta shall notify Contoso, as soon as reasonably practicable, of any cancellation or material reduction in the coverage of such policies.

10.3 **No Limitation.**  
The existence of insurance and the terms of any insurance policy shall not relieve Beta of any of its obligations or liabilities under this Agreement, nor shall it limit or cap Beta’s liability except to the extent expressly set out in Article IX.

## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.**  
(a) The Parties acknowledge that, in the course of providing the Services, Beta may process Personal Data on behalf of Contoso. In such circumstances, Contoso shall be the “controller” and Beta shall be the “processor” (as those terms are defined in the Data Protection Legislation).  

(b) Each Party shall comply with its respective obligations under the Data Protection Legislation in relation to any Personal Data processed in connection with this Agreement.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.**  
Beta shall process Personal Data only on the documented instructions of Contoso, as set out in this Agreement, the relevant SOW, or as otherwise documented in writing by Contoso from time to time, unless Beta is required to process Personal Data by Applicable Law, in which case Beta shall inform Contoso of that legal requirement before processing, unless prohibited by law.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
Beta shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of or access to Personal Data, including, as appropriate:  

(a) pseudonymisation and encryption;  

(b) the ability to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;  

(c) the ability to restore availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and  

(d) processes for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational security measures.

11.4 **Sub-processors.**  
(a) Contoso hereby authorises Beta to engage sub-processors to process Personal Data on behalf of Contoso, provided that Beta:  

   (i) imposes data protection obligations on such sub-processors that are no less protective than those set out in this Article XI; and  
   (ii) remains liable to Contoso for the acts and omissions of such sub-processors.  

(b) Beta shall maintain a list of sub-processors and shall notify Contoso of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of sub-processors, giving Contoso the opportunity to object on reasonable grounds relating to data protection.

11.5 **Data Subject Rights.**  
Taking into account the nature of the processing, Beta shall assist Contoso, to the extent reasonably possible and at Contoso’s cost (where such assistance goes beyond the standard Services), in fulfilling Contoso’s obligations to respond to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under the Data Protection Legislation (including rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection).

11.6 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a Personal Data breach (as defined in the Data Protection Legislation) affecting Personal Data processed by Beta on behalf of Contoso, Beta shall:  

(a) notify Contoso without undue delay, and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours after becoming aware of the breach;  

(b) provide Contoso with sufficient information to allow Contoso to meet its obligations to report or inform data subjects and regulators, including the nature of the breach, categories of data subjects and Personal Data affected, likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to address the breach; and  

(c) cooperate reasonably with Contoso in investigating and remediating the breach, including in relation to any notifications to supervisory authorities or data subjects.

11.7 **Cross-Border Transfers.**  
To the extent Beta transfers Personal Data outside the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area to a country that is not subject to an adequacy decision under the Data Protection Legislation, the Parties shall ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, such as the use of standard contractual clauses or an equivalent mechanism.

11.8 **Data Retention.**  
Beta shall not retain Personal Data for longer than is necessary to perform the Services and fulfil its obligations under this Agreement, except where a longer retention period is required by Applicable Law. Upon termination of this Agreement or upon Contoso’s written request, Beta shall, at Contoso’s option, securely delete or return all Personal Data (and any copies thereof), subject to any legal or regulatory obligations requiring retention.

11.9 **Audits.**  
Subject to reasonable notice and confidentiality obligations, Beta shall make available to Contoso such information as is reasonably necessary to demonstrate Beta’s compliance with this Article XI and shall, upon reasonable notice and at reasonable intervals, permit Contoso or its appointed auditors (not being a competitor of Beta) to conduct audits, including inspections, of Beta’s data processing activities, during normal business hours and without undue disruption to Beta’s business.

11.10 **Survival.**  
The provisions of this Article XI shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement for so long as Beta processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Applicability.**  
This Article XII shall apply to any maintenance, support, hosting, or managed services provided by Beta under this Agreement, as specified in the relevant SOW. For clarity, certain Products and Services may be excluded from Service Level commitments, as expressly identified in the SOW.

12.2 **Availability.**  
(a) Where Beta provides hosted or managed infrastructure services, Beta shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the relevant systems are available to Contoso **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and Permitted Downtime (“**Availability Commitment**”).  

(b) “**Scheduled Maintenance**” means planned maintenance carried out by Beta, for which Beta shall use reasonable endeavours to provide at least five (5) Business Days’ prior notice and schedule outside normal business hours.  

(c) “**Permitted Downtime**” means downtime caused by: (i) Scheduled Maintenance; (ii) emergency maintenance required to address critical security or operational issues; (iii) Force Majeure Events; (iv) failures attributable to Contoso’s systems or third parties not under Beta’s control; or (v) Contoso’s failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

12.3 **Response and Resolution Times.**  
(a) Beta shall respond to and use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve incidents reported by Contoso according to the following priority levels, unless otherwise specified in the SOW:

- **Priority 1 (Critical)**: Complete loss of service or severe business impact.  
  - Initial Response: within 1 hour.  
  - Target Resolution: within 8 hours.  

- **Priority 2 (High)**: Significant degradation of service with substantial business impact.  
  - Initial Response: within 4 hours.  
  - Target Resolution: within 1 Business Day.  

- **Priority 3 (Medium)**: Partial loss or degradation with limited business impact.  
  - Initial Response: within 1 Business Day.  
  - Target Resolution: within 3 Business Days.  

- **Priority 4 (Low)**: Minor issues, cosmetic defects, or information requests.  
  - Initial Response: within 2 Business Days.  
  - Target Resolution: as reasonably practicable.

(b) Response and resolution times are targets and not guarantees, but persistent failure to meet them may constitute a Service Level failure as described below.

12.4 **Service Credits.**  
(a) If Beta fails to meet the Availability Commitment in any calendar month (a “**Service Level Failure**”), Contoso shall be entitled to service credits in accordance with the schedule set out in the relevant SOW or, if not specified, as follows:  

- Availability between 99.0% and 99.9%: service credit equal to 5% of the monthly Fees for the affected service.  
- Availability between 95.0% and 99.0%: service credit equal to 10% of the monthly Fees for the affected service.  
- Availability below 95.0%: service credit equal to 20% of the monthly Fees for the affected service.

(b) Service credits shall be applied against the next invoice(s) issued by Beta. Service credits are Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for Service Level Failures, subject to Contoso’s rights to terminate for persistent failures under Section 4.4 and to claim damages within the limits of Article IX.

12.5 **Exclusions.**  
Service Levels shall not apply to:  

(a) any failure or delay caused by Force Majeure Events;  

(b) any failure attributable to Contoso, its systems, or third-party services not provided by Beta;  

(c) beta, trial or non-production environments; or  

(d) maintenance or changes requested or initiated by Contoso outside of standard processes.

12.6 **Reporting.**  
Beta shall maintain records of system performance and Service Level metrics and shall provide Contoso with periodic reports (at least quarterly) summarising performance against the Service Levels, upon request.

## CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  
Either Party may, from time to time, request changes to the scope, Deliverables, timelines, or other aspects of the Services or Products described in an SOW or PO (each a “**Change Request**”).

13.2 **Change Control Process.**  
(a) Upon receipt of a Change Request, the receiving Party shall review the request and, where appropriate, provide the other Party with a written impact assessment, including:  

   (i) any changes to scope or Deliverables;  
   (ii) the impact on timelines and milestones;  
   (iii) any changes to Fees; and  
   (iv) any additional assumptions or dependencies.  

(b) The Parties shall discuss the impact assessment in good faith. No Change Request shall be binding unless and until the Parties have agreed to and signed a written Change Order referencing this Agreement and the affected SOW or PO.

13.3 **Effect on Fees and Timelines.**  
Any approved Change Order may result in adjustments to the Fees, timelines, or other terms set forth in the relevant SOW or PO. The Parties shall reflect such adjustments clearly in the Change Order.

13.4 **No Implied Changes.**  
Until a Change Order is duly executed, the Parties shall continue to perform their obligations in accordance with the existing SOW or PO, and neither Party shall be obliged to implement any requested change.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.**  
If any dispute, controversy, or claim arises out of or in connection with this Agreement, including its existence, validity, or termination (a “**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first seek to resolve it promptly through good faith negotiations between their respective operational contacts.

14.2 **Escalation.**  
If the Dispute has not been resolved within fifteen (15) Business Days after written notice of the Dispute, either Party may escalate the Dispute to senior management. The Parties’ senior representatives shall meet (in person or by video conference) and use reasonable efforts to resolve the Dispute within a further fifteen (15) Business Days.

14.3 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through escalation under Section 14.2, the Parties shall consider in good faith resolving the Dispute by mediation using a mediator appointed by agreement between the Parties, or, failing agreement, one appointed by the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) in London. Unless otherwise agreed, the Parties shall share equally the mediator’s fees and any administrative costs.

14.4 **Court Proceedings.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after commencement of the escalation process under Section 14.2, either Party may commence court proceedings in accordance with Section 16.10. Nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking interim or injunctive relief at any time.

15.2 **Consequences of Force Majeure.**  
(a) If a Party is prevented, hindered, or delayed from performing any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than an obligation to pay money) due to a Force Majeure Event, such Party shall not be in breach of this Agreement to the extent and for so long as its performance is prevented, hindered or delayed by such event, provided that it:  

   (i) promptly notifies the other Party in writing of the occurrence and expected duration of the Force Majeure Event; and  
   (ii) uses reasonable endeavours to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event and resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable.
