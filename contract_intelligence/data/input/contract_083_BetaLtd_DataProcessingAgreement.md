## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with Data Protection Laws applicable to its role in the Processing of Personal Data under this Agreement.

Beta, as processor/service provider, shall Process Personal Data only as set forth in this Agreement and in Contoso’s documented instructions.

11.2 **Processing as Service Provider/Processor.**  
Beta shall:

  (a) Process Personal Data only on behalf of Contoso and solely for the limited purposes described in Article II and the Underlying Agreement;  
  (b) not sell or share Personal Data (as defined by the CCPA) or retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any purpose other than the business purposes specified in this Agreement, or as otherwise permitted by Data Protection Laws; and  
  (c) not combine Personal Data with data received from other sources, except as permitted by Data Protection Laws and necessary to provide the Services or create Aggregated Data.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
Beta shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, including, as appropriate:

  (a) encryption of Personal Data in transit and at rest where commercially reasonable;  
  (b) access controls based on least privilege and role-based access;  
  (c) regular vulnerability assessments and patch management;  
  (d) secure development practices, including code reviews and testing;

  (b) provide Contoso with reasonable information regarding the nature of the Security Incident, the categories and approximate number of affected Data Subjects and records, the likely consequences, and the measures taken or proposed to address the Security Incident;  
  (c) cooperate with Contoso, at Contoso’s reasonable request and expense, in any investigation, notification, or remediation efforts required by Data Protection Laws; and  
  (d) not make any public statement regarding the Security Incident that identifies Contoso or its customers without Contoso’s prior written consent, except as required by law.

11.5 **Data Subject Requests.**  
Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Beta shall:

  (a) assist Contoso by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as possible, for the fulfillment of Contoso’s obligations to respond to Data Subject requests (e.g., access, rectification, erasure, restriction, objection, portability); and  
  (b) promptly notify Contoso if Beta receives any request directly from a Data Subject relating to Personal Data Processed on behalf of Contoso, and shall not respond to such request except on documented instructions from Contoso or as required by law.

11.7 **Audit Rights.**  
Contoso, or an independent third-party auditor mandated by Contoso and mutually agreed by Beta (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld), may, upon at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice and no more than once in any rolling twelve (12) month period (except following a Security Incident or at the direction of a regulator), audit Beta’s compliance with this Article XI, subject to:

  (b) the audit being conducted during normal business hours and without unreasonable interference with Beta’s operations; and

11.8 **Sub-processors.**  
Beta may engage Sub-processors as described in Section 2.10, provided that Beta:

  (c) upon Contoso’s written request, provides an up-to-date list of Sub-processors and notifies Contoso of any intended addition or replacement of Sub-processors, giving Contoso an opportunity to reasonably object, in which case the Parties shall work in good faith to resolve the objection.

Beta shall not retain Personal Data longer than necessary for the purposes of providing the Services, except where retention is required by Applicable Law.

The Parties agree to execute any additional documents reasonably necessary to implement such mechanisms.
