## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with the performance of this Agreement. To the extent Pinnacle processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso, Pinnacle shall act as a “processor” or “service provider” (as applicable), and Contoso shall act as a “controller” or “business” (as applicable).

11.2 **Data Processing Obligations.**  
Pinnacle shall:

  (a) Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, including with respect to the nature, purpose, and duration of processing, and the categories of data subjects and Personal Data, as set forth in this Agreement and any applicable data processing addendum;  
  (b) Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access;  
  (c) Ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;

  (e) Assist Contoso, to the extent reasonably practicable and at Contoso’s cost (to the extent such assistance is beyond the standard Services), with responding to requests from data subjects and with Contoso’s compliance obligations under Data Protection Laws (e.g., data protection impact assessments, consultations with supervisory authorities).

11.3 **Subprocessors.**  
Pinnacle may engage subprocessors to process Personal Data on its behalf, provided that:

  (a) Pinnacle enters into a written agreement with each subprocessor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement;  
  (b) Pinnacle remains responsible and liable for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors as if they were its own; and  
  (c) Pinnacle shall maintain a list of subprocessors and make it available to Contoso upon request, and shall provide advance notice (which may be general) of any material changes to such list, giving Contoso an opportunity to object on reasonable grounds.

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **General.**  
Pinnacle shall provide the Services in accordance with the Service Levels set forth in this Article XII and any applicable SOW. In the event of a conflict between this Article XII and a SOW, the SOW shall control with respect to the Services covered by that SOW.

12.2 **System Availability.**  
Pinnacle shall use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve a minimum monthly **System Availability of 99.9%** for the production environment hosting the Services, measured on a 24x7 basis, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and any downtime caused by: (a) Contoso’s acts or omissions, (b) Force Majeure Events, (c) third-party network or telecommunications failures outside Pinnacle’s control, or (d) Contoso’s non-compliance with the Agreement.

12.3 **Calculation of System Availability.**  
System Availability shall be calculated as follows:

> Availability % = (Total Minutes in Month – Unscheduled Downtime Minutes) / (Total Minutes in Month) × 100

Where “Unscheduled Downtime” means minutes during which the production environment is not capable of receiving, processing, and responding to requests, other than during Scheduled Maintenance or exclusions as defined above.

12.4 **Support Hours and Response Times.**  
Unless otherwise specified in a SOW, the help desk shall be available 24x7 for Incident reporting. Pinnacle shall adhere to the following target response and resolution times:

- **Priority 1 (Critical)** – Complete loss of Service or severe degradation impacting a majority of users and no workaround:  
  - Initial Response: 1 hour  
  - Target Resolution or Workaround: 4 hours  

- **Priority 2 (High)** – Significant functionality impaired, major impact, workaround available:  
  - Initial Response: 2 hours  
  - Target Resolution or Workaround: 1 Business Day  

- **Priority 3 (Medium)** – Limited impact, partial loss of non-critical functionality:  
  - Initial Response: 4 Business Hours  
  - Target Resolution or Workaround: 3 Business Days  

- **Priority 4 (Low)** – Minor issues, cosmetic problems, or general requests:  
  - Initial Response: 1 Business Day  
  - Target Resolution or Workaround: 10 Business Days  

12.5 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  
Pinnacle may perform Scheduled Maintenance during designated maintenance windows, which shall be communicated to Contoso at least five (5) Business Days in advance, except in cases of emergency. Pinnacle shall use reasonable efforts to schedule maintenance during off-peak hours and to minimize any impact on the Services. Scheduled Maintenance of up to eight (8) hours per calendar month shall not count as Unscheduled Downtime for purposes of calculating System Availability.

12.6 **Service Credits.**  
If Pinnacle fails to meet the System Availability commitment in Section 12.2 in a given calendar month, Contoso shall be entitled to the following service credits, calculated as a percentage of the monthly recurring fees for the affected Services:

- Availability between 99.0% and 99.9%: 5% credit  
- Availability between 98.0% and 99.0%: 10% credit  
- Availability below 98.0%: 15% credit  

Service credits shall be applied to the invoice for the month following the month in which the failure occurred. To receive a service credit, Contoso must request the credit in writing within thirty (30) days of the end of the month in which the failure occurred. Service credits constitute Contoso’s exclusive monetary remedy for failure to achieve the System Availability commitment, without prejudice to Contoso’s termination rights under **Section 4.5**.

12.7 **Chronic Issues and Remediation.**  
If Pinnacle repeatedly fails to meet any Service Level, the Parties shall meet in good faith to discuss root cause analysis and a remediation plan. Pinnacle shall prepare a written root cause analysis and remediation plan for Contoso’s review, and implement agreed corrective actions within reasonable timeframes.

  (b) Rejection of the change with reasons; or  
  (c) A proposal for a Change Order including adjustments to fees, timelines, resources, and Service Levels, if applicable.

13.4 **Effect of Changes.**  
Until a Change Order is executed, the Parties shall continue to perform their obligations in accordance with the existing Agreement and SOW(s) without regard to the proposed changes. Upon execution of a Change Order, Pinnacle shall implement the changes in accordance with the agreed timelines and terms.

Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with the mediation, and the Parties shall share equally the mediator’s fees.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after initiation of mediation, or if the Parties agree in writing to bypass mediation, then, subject to Section 14.4, either Party may pursue its rights and remedies in accordance with the following:

- The Parties agree that any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in **New York County, New York**;  
- Each Party irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection to venue based on forum non conveniens or similar doctrine.

14.4 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction at any time, without the requirement of posting a bond (or with a nominal bond if required), to protect its Confidential Information, Intellectual Property Rights, or Personal Data, or to prevent irreparable harm.

14.5 **Governing Law.**
