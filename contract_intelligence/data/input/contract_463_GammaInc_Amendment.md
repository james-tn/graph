8.2 **Gamma Indemnification of Contoso.** Gamma shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Contoso and its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and contractors (collectively, the **“Contoso Indemnified Parties”**) from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to any Third-Party Claim to the extent resulting from: (a) an allegation that the Platform, as provided by Gamma and used by Contoso in accordance with this Amendment, directly infringes a valid U.S. patent, copyright, or trade secret of a third party; or (b) Gamma’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

8.3 **Exclusions.** Gamma shall have no indemnification obligation under Section 8.2 for any claims to the extent arising from: (a) modification of the Platform or Deliverables by any party other than Gamma; (b) combination or use of the Platform or Deliverables with any products, services, or data not supplied or approved in writing by Gamma; (c) compliance by Gamma with designs, specifications, or instructions provided by Contoso; or (d) Contoso’s use of the Platform or Deliverables after Gamma has notified Contoso to cease such use to avoid further infringement.

8.4 **Remedies for Infringement.** If the Platform or any Deliverable is, or in Gamma’s reasonable opinion is likely to be, the subject of an infringement claim, Gamma may, at its option and expense: (a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using the affected item; (b) replace or modify the affected item so that it becomes non-infringing while still providing substantially equivalent functionality; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected Services and provide a pro rata refund of pre-paid Fees for the terminated Services.

8.5 **Indemnification Procedures.** The obligations of an indemnifying Party under this Article VIII are conditioned upon the indemnified Party: (a) promptly providing written notice of the Third-Party Claim (provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent materially prejudiced); (b) granting the indemnifying Party sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (except that the indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim that imposes any admission of fault or payment obligation on the indemnified Party without its prior written consent); and (c) providing the indemnifying Party with reasonable cooperation and assistance at the indemnifying Party’s expense.

12.2 **Measurement.** Uptime shall be measured as the total minutes in a calendar month minus unexcused downtime divided by the total minutes in that month, multiplied by 100%. Gamma’s monitoring tools and logs shall be the authoritative source for calculating uptime.

- Uptime between 98.0% and 98.99%: 10% credit  
- Uptime below 98.0%: 15% credit

12.5 **Scheduled Maintenance.** Gamma may perform scheduled maintenance during standard maintenance windows as reasonably determined by Gamma. Gamma shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least five (5) Business Days’ advance notice to Contoso of scheduled maintenance that is expected to cause material downtime.
