8.3 **Indemnification Procedures.** The indemnification procedures in Section 8.3 of the Parent Agreement apply equally to indemnification Claims under this Addendum.

## ARTICLE IX – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (ADDENDUM)

9.1 **Modification of Cap – High Risk, Vendor‑Favourable.**  

9.1.1 Notwithstanding Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement (Cap on Liability – five (5) times Fees paid in the preceding twelve (12) months), the Parties agree that **no contractual monetary cap shall apply to Acme’s liability under this Addendum**. The Parties further agree that, given the high‑risk classification of this Addendum and the critical importance of the Additional Products to Contoso’s operations, any limitations or caps under the Parent Agreement shall **not limit the aggregate liability of Acme arising from or in connection with this Addendum**.

9.1.2 For clarity, Acme’s liability in connection with this Addendum may exceed the Fee multiples set forth in Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement, and Contoso’s liability under this Addendum shall similarly not be subject to such cap.

9.2 **Consequential and Indirect Damages.**  

9.2.1 In deviation from Section 9.1 of the Parent Agreement, the Parties agree that **neither Party shall be excluded from liability for indirect, consequential, or special damages arising out of or in connection with this Addendum** where such damages are reasonably foreseeable and arise as a direct result of a material breach of this Addendum or the Parent Agreement.  

9.2.2 The Parties acknowledge that this represents a material deviation from the exclusion of consequential damages in the Parent Agreement and forms part of the high‑risk, Vendor‑favourable risk allocation requested by the Parties for this Addendum.

9.3 **Exceptions.** The exceptions to limitation in Section 9.3 of the Parent Agreement (death/personal injury, fraud, confidentiality, data protection, indemnity obligations, and mandatory legal liabilities) remain applicable and are not restricted by this Article IX.

9.4 **Mitigation.** Each Party shall, to the extent commercially reasonable, mitigate losses in connection with any Claim arising under this Addendum, in accordance with Section 9.4 of the Parent Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE X – INSURANCE

10.1 **Insurance Coverage.** Acme shall maintain insurance coverage as required by Article X of the Parent Agreement. In light of the uncapped liability under this Addendum, Acme shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that its Professional Indemnity/Errors & Omissions and Cyber/Data Protection Liability limits are adequate relative to the combined contract values of the Parent Agreement and this Addendum; however, the absence or insufficiency of insurance shall not limit Acme’s liability.

10.2 **Evidence of Insurance.** Upon Contoso’s reasonable request, Acme shall provide updated certificates of insurance reflecting current coverage, consistent with Section 10.2 of the Parent Agreement.

---

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY (ADDENDUM)

11.1 **Application of Parent Agreement.** Article XI of the Parent Agreement (Data Protection and Privacy) applies in full to the Additional Products and Additional Services. For the avoidance of doubt, Contoso remains the **controller** and Acme the **processor** with respect to any Personal Data processed in connection with the Additional Products.

11.2 **AI/Analytics Specific Considerations.**  

11.2.1 Acme shall ensure that any AI models and analytics processes that involve Personal Data are designed and configured in a manner compliant with UK GDPR, the Data Protection Act 2018 and other applicable Data Protection Laws, including requirements for fairness, transparency, and data minimisation.

11.2.2 Where Contoso relies on the outputs of the Advanced Analytics Module or AI‑Assisted Customer Support Module for decision‑making that may significantly affect individuals, Acme shall, upon request and where technically feasible, provide Contoso with appropriate information about the logic involved in the processing, in accordance with applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.3 **Data Breach Notification.** The breach notification obligations in Section 11.4 of the Parent Agreement (notification within forty‑eight (48) hours and provision of information to enable regulatory reporting) apply to any breach affecting Personal Data processed as part of the Additional Products and Additional Services.

11.4 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Following termination of this Addendum and/or the Parent Agreement, Acme shall, at Contoso’s written election, delete or return all Personal Data processed solely in connection with the Additional Products, in accordance with Section 11.5 of the Parent Agreement.

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (ADDENDUM)

12.1 **Uptime Commitment (Enhanced).**  

12.1.1 In addition to the availability commitment of 99.9% per calendar month set forth in Section 12.1 of the Parent Agreement, Acme shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Advanced Analytics Module and AI‑Assisted Customer Support Module achieve **99.95% availability** per calendar month, excluding Permitted Downtime as defined in Section 12.2 of the Parent Agreement.

12.2 **Support Response Times (Enhanced).**  

12.2.1 For incidents relating to the Additional Products, the following enhanced response targets shall apply during the extended support hours described in Section 2.3.2 of this Addendum:

   - **Priority 1 (Critical – analytics platform or AI‑assisted support unavailable in production):** Initial response within 30 minutes; continuous efforts until workaround or solution provided.  
   - **Priority 2 (High – major functionality impaired for analytics or AI support):** Initial response within 2 hours; reasonable efforts to resolve within 8 hours.  
   - **Priority 3 (Medium):** Initial response within 1 Business Day; resolution or workaround within 3 Business Days where practicable.  
   - **Priority 4 (Low):** Initial response within 2 Business Days; resolution by inclusion in a future maintenance release or as agreed.

12.3 **Service Credits – Addendum.**  

12.3.1 If monthly availability of the Additional Products falls below 99.95% (excluding Permitted Downtime), Contoso shall be entitled, upon written request within thirty (30) days of month‑end, to incremental service credits in addition to those in Section 12.4 of the Parent Agreement, calculated as a percentage of the monthly portion of the Global Support Enhancement Fees attributable to the affected month:

   - Availability between 99.5% and 99.94%: 5% credit;  
   - Availability between 99.0% and 99.49%: 10% credit;  
   - Availability below 99.0%: 20% credit.

12.3.2 Service credits constitute Contoso’s sole monetary remedy for failing to meet these enhanced Service Levels, without prejudice to Contoso’s termination rights under Article IV of the Parent Agreement and this Addendum.

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT (ADDENDUM)

13.1 **Change Requests.** The change management process in Article XIII of the Parent Agreement applies to this Addendum. Any changes to scope, Fees, timelines, or Service Levels relating to the Additional Products and Additional Services shall be documented via a written Change Order referencing both the Parent Agreement and this Addendum.

13.2 **Impact Assessment.** Acme shall assess the impact of any proposed change on the project schedule, Milestones, Fees, and resource requirements and provide a written change proposal, in accordance with Section 13.2 of the Parent Agreement.

13.3 **Approval and Effect.** No change shall be binding unless agreed in a Change Order signed by authorised representatives of both Parties under Section 13.3 of the Parent Agreement. Once executed, such Change Order shall form part of this Addendum and the Parent Agreement.

13.4 **Continuity of Services.** Pending agreement on a proposed change, Acme shall continue to perform the Additional Services in accordance with the existing scope unless otherwise directed in writing by Contoso and accepted by Acme, consistent with Section 13.4 of the Parent Agreement.

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.2 **Escalation and Mediation.** The Parties agree to follow the good faith negotiations, escalation to senior management, and mediation steps specified in Sections 14.1–14.3 of the Parent Agreement prior to initiating litigation.

14.3 **Jurisdiction.** Any litigation arising in relation to this Addendum shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales, in accordance with Section 14.4 and Section 16.9 of the Parent Agreement.

---

15.1 **Force Majeure Events.** The definition of Force Majeure Event in Section 15.1 of the Parent Agreement applies equally to this Addendum.

15.2 **Effect on Additional Products and Services.** In the event of a Force Majeure Event affecting delivery of the Additional Products or Additional Services, Acme’s obligations shall be suspended to the extent and for the duration specified in Sections 15.2–15.3 of the Parent Agreement, and Contoso’s corresponding obligations (including payment for unaffected Services) shall be similarly suspended or adjusted.

15.3 **Extended Force Majeure.** If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and materially affects performance under this Addendum, either Party may terminate this Addendum in accordance with Section 15.4 of the Parent Agreement, without liability except for accrued rights and obligations.
