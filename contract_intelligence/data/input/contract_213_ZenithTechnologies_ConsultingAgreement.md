11.2 **Role of the Parties.**  

  11.2.1 To the extent Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of Client, the Parties acknowledge that Client is the “controller” (or equivalent term) and Vendor is the “processor” (or equivalent term) under GDPR and analogous Data Protection Laws.

  11.2.2 Vendor shall process Personal Data solely on documented instructions from Client, except as required by Applicable Law, in which case Vendor shall inform Client of that legal requirement before processing, unless prohibited by law.

11.3 **Security Measures.** Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, commensurate with the risk and in accordance with industry best practices.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Vendor may engage subprocessors to process Personal Data on its behalf, provided that: (a) Vendor imposes on such subprocessors data protection obligations that are no less protective than those set out in this Article XI; and (b) Vendor remains liable for the acts and omissions of such subprocessors.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  

  11.5.1 In the event of a confirmed unauthorized access, acquisition, or disclosure of Personal Data processed by Vendor under this Agreement (a “**Data Breach**”), Vendor shall notify Client without undue delay and, in any event, within seventy-two (72) hours of becoming aware of the Data Breach.

  11.5.2 Such notice shall include, to the extent known: the nature of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects and data records concerned, likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to be taken to address the Data Breach.

11.6 **Data Subject Requests.** Vendor shall, to the extent legally permitted and technically feasible, assist Client in responding to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of access, deletion, or correction), where such requests relate to Personal Data processed by Vendor on behalf of Client.

11.7 **Data Transfers.** If Vendor transfers Personal Data outside of the jurisdiction where it was collected in a manner that requires additional safeguards under Data Protection Laws (e.g., transfer from the EU/EEA to a third country), the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses) as required by such laws.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination of this Agreement or upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall, at Client’s option, return or securely delete Personal Data, except to the extent Vendor is required by law to retain such data.

11.9 **Additional Data Processing Terms.** To the extent required under Data Protection Laws, the Parties shall execute a separate data processing agreement or addendum, which shall be incorporated into this Agreement by reference and, in case of conflict, shall prevail over this Article XI with respect to the processing of Personal Data.
