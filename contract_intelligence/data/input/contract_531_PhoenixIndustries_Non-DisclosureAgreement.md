Phoenix shall validate with Contoso all material assumptions and dependencies before proceeding to design and implementation activities.

  2.2.2 **Solution Design and Architecture.**  
  Phoenix shall design a scalable and secure solution architecture to meet Contoso’s requirements, including data models, integration patterns, user access models, security controls, and performance considerations. Phoenix shall prepare high-level and detailed design documents, including system diagrams, integration specifications, and interface control documentation. Phoenix shall consider Contoso’s existing tools and platforms to maximize reuse and minimize disruption.

  2.2.3 **Development and Configuration.**  
  Phoenix shall develop and configure the necessary software components, integrations, data pipelines, dashboards, and reports. This may include custom code, configuration of off-the-shelf platforms, APIs, and infrastructure-as-code scripts. Phoenix shall follow industry-standard software development practices, including version control, code review processes, and test-driven or behavior-driven development methodologies where appropriate.

  2.2.4 **Testing and Quality Assurance.**  
  Phoenix shall develop and execute test plans, including unit tests, integration tests, system tests, performance tests, and user acceptance test support, as agreed. Phoenix shall remediate defects identified during testing in a timely manner and shall not move any component into production without Contoso’s written acceptance or sign-off in accordance with the applicable SOW.

  2.2.5 **Deployment and Cut-Over Support.**  
  Phoenix shall assist Contoso with deployment activities, including configuration of production environments, data migration, cut-over planning, go-live support, and rollback procedures as required.

2.6 **Subcontracting.**  
Phoenix may not subcontract any material portion of the Services without Contoso’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Phoenix shall remain fully responsible for the acts and omissions of any approved subcontractors and shall ensure that such subcontractors are bound by written obligations at least as protective of Contoso as those set forth in this Agreement, including with respect to confidentiality, data protection, and IP ownership.

## ARTICLE III  
## FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Contract Value.**  
The total estimated contract value for the Services and Deliverables to be provided under this Agreement is **US$3,738,371** (the “**Contract Value**”), subject to adjustments through mutually executed SOWs and Change Orders.

3.2 **Fee Structure.**  
The fees payable to Phoenix may consist of one or more of the following components, as detailed in the applicable SOW:

  3.2.1 **Fixed Fees.** Fixed-price amounts for defined Deliverables or phases;  
  3.2.2 **Time-and-Materials Fees.** Hourly or daily rates for specific roles (e.g., project manager, architect, developer, tester); and  
  3.2.3 **Recurring Fees.** Ongoing support or maintenance fees, if any.

3.3 **Payment Milestones.**  
Unless otherwise stated in an applicable SOW, the Contract Value shall be invoiced based on project milestones substantially as follows:

  - 20% upon completion and acceptance of the Discovery and Requirements phase;  
  - 25% upon completion and acceptance of the Solution Design phase;  
  - 30% upon completion and acceptance of Development and System Testing;  
  - 15% upon successful Production Deployment and Go-Live; and  
  - 10% upon completion of the initial Support and Knowledge Transfer period.

Each invoice shall clearly reference the relevant milestone, SOW, and this Agreement’s contract reference number **NDA-PHO-202412-531**.

3.4 **Payment Terms.**  
Contoso shall pay undisputed amounts on each properly issued invoice within **sixty (60) calendar days** of its receipt (“**Net 60**” terms). An invoice shall be considered properly issued only if it includes sufficient detail to enable Contoso to verify the basis for the charges, including the applicable milestone(s), hours worked (if time-and-materials), rates, and any pre-approved expenses.

3.5 **Disputed Amounts.**  
If Contoso in good faith disputes any portion of an invoice, Contoso shall notify Phoenix in writing within fifteen (15) days of receipt, specifying the nature and amount of the dispute. Contoso may withhold payment of the disputed portion, but shall pay all undisputed amounts when due. The Parties shall use good faith efforts to resolve any such dispute promptly. Any resolution requiring an adjustment to a previously issued invoice shall be reflected in a credit memo or supplemental invoice.

3.6 **Late Payment.**  
Any undisputed amounts not paid within fifteen (15) days after the due date may accrue interest from the date due until paid in full at a rate equal to the lesser of (a) one percent (1%) per month, or (b) the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. Phoenix shall provide written notice to Contoso of any past-due undisputed invoice before applying interest. The Parties agree that such interest is a reasonable estimate of the costs associated with late payment and not a penalty.

3.7 **Expenses and Reimbursement.**  
Phoenix shall be responsible for all normal overhead and administrative costs associated with its performance of the Services. Contoso shall reimburse Phoenix for reasonable, pre-approved, out-of-pocket travel and other expenses incurred in connection with the Services, provided that: (a) such expenses comply with Contoso’s then-current travel and expense policies (provided to Phoenix in advance); and (b) Phoenix submits appropriate supporting documentation (e.g., receipts, travel itineraries) along with its invoice.

3.8 **Taxes.**  
All fees are exclusive of applicable sales, use, value-added, or similar taxes, duties, or governmental charges (collectively, “**Taxes**”), which shall be Contoso’s responsibility, except for taxes based on Phoenix’s net income, property, or employees. Phoenix shall itemize any applicable Taxes on its invoices and shall cooperate with Contoso in providing documentation reasonably required for Contoso to claim any available tax credits or exemptions.

3.9 **No Withholding for Setoff (Subject to Dispute Rights).**  
Except as expressly permitted in **Section 3.5** with respect to disputed amounts, Contoso shall not withhold, set off, or deduct any amounts from payments due under this Agreement without Phoenix’s prior written consent or a final, non-appealable order of a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction.

5.5 **Compelled Disclosure.**  
If the Receiving Party is required by law, regulation, or court order to disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permitted, provide prompt written notice to the Disclosing Party so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy.

The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief and Provisional Remedies.**
