14.4 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  
If the Parties do not resolve the Dispute through negotiation or mediation within sixty (60) days from initiation of mediation, either Party may pursue its rights and remedies in court.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek immediate injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or curtail actual or threatened unauthorized use or disclosure of its Confidential Information or infringement of its Intellectual Property Rights.
