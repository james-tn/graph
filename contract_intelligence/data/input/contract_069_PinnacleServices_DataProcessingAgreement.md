## ARTICLE XI  
### DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.**  
For purposes of Data Protection Laws, Contoso is the Controller (or Business) and Pinnacle is the Processor (or Service Provider) with respect to Personal Data Processed under this Agreement.

11.2 **Processor / Service Provider Commitments (No Sale / No Secondary Use).**  
Pinnacle shall:

  11.2.1 Process Personal Data solely on behalf of Contoso and in accordance with Contoso’s documented Instructions, except where otherwise required by Applicable Law;

  11.2.2 Not “sell” or “share” Personal Data (as such terms are defined under the CCPA) and not use Personal Data for purposes other than those specified in this Agreement, except as permitted by Data Protection Laws;

  11.2.3 Not combine Personal Data it receives from Contoso with personal data it receives from other sources, except to the extent permitted under Data Protection Laws and necessary to provide the Services, and only in a manner that does not constitute a “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Data.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
Pinnacle shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, where appropriate:

  11.3.1 Pseudonymization and encryption of Personal Data;

  11.3.2 Measures to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services;

  11.3.3 Measures to restore availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;

  11.3.4 A process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of Processing.

11.4 **Instructions.**  
Pinnacle shall Process Personal Data only on documented Instructions from Contoso, including with respect to international transfers, unless required to do so by Applicable Law. If Pinnacle believes that an Instruction violates Data Protection Laws, it shall promptly notify Contoso. Contoso shall be responsible for ensuring that its Instructions comply with Data Protection Laws.

11.5 **Confidentiality of Personnel.**  
Pinnacle shall ensure that persons authorized to Process Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality and have received appropriate training regarding data protection and security.

11.6 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a Personal Data Breach affecting Personal Data Processed by Pinnacle:

  11.6.1 Pinnacle shall notify Contoso without undue delay and, where feasible, no later than seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the breach;

  11.6.2 Such notice shall include, to the extent available: (a) the nature of the breach, including affected categories and approximate number of Data Subjects and records; (b) likely consequences; and (c) measures taken or proposed to address the breach and mitigate its adverse effects;

  11.6.3 Pinnacle shall cooperate with Contoso, at Contoso’s reasonable request, in investigating the breach, fulfilling any statutory notification obligations to supervisory authorities or Data Subjects, and mitigating the breach’s effects.

11.7 **Sub-processors.**  

  11.7.1 Pinnacle may engage Sub-processors to Process Personal Data on its behalf, provided that Pinnacle: (a) imposes on such Sub-processors contractual obligations that are no less protective of Personal Data than those imposed on Pinnacle under this Agreement; and (b) remains responsible for the acts and omissions of its Sub-processors.

  11.7.2 Upon Contoso’s written request, Pinnacle shall provide a current list of Sub-processors that Process Personal Data. Contoso may object to the engagement of a new Sub-processor by providing a written objection on reasonable data protection grounds within ten (10) Business Days of receiving notice. The Parties shall work in good faith to address Contoso’s concerns; if they cannot be resolved, Contoso may terminate the affected portion of the Services without penalty.

11.8 **Data Subject Requests.**  
Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Pinnacle shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as possible, to assist Contoso in fulfilling its obligations to respond to requests by Data Subjects to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection). If Pinnacle receives a Data Subject request directly, it shall, where the request identifies Contoso as the relevant Controller, promptly forward the request to Contoso and not respond except on Contoso’s documented Instructions.

11.9 **Assistance with Data Protection Impact Assessments and Consultations.**  
Pinnacle shall, upon Contoso’s reasonable request and at Contoso’s expense (to the extent such assistance is excessive or outside ordinary operations), provide assistance reasonably necessary for Contoso to conduct data protection impact assessments and prior consultations with supervisory authorities in relation to Pinnacle’s Processing under this Agreement.

11.10 **International Data Transfers.**  
To the extent Personal Data is transferred outside the country or region of origin:

  11.10.1 Pinnacle shall not transfer Personal Data to a country or territory that does not ensure an adequate level of protection under Data Protection Laws without Contoso’s prior written authorization;

  11.10.2 Where required, the Parties shall enter into appropriate data transfer mechanisms (such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent instruments) to legitimize such transfers, which are incorporated herein by reference to the extent executed by the Parties.

11.11 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Pinnacle shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Personal Data shall be returned or deleted pursuant to Section 4.5.2, subject to any legal retention obligations. Any retained Personal Data shall remain subject to this Article XI until deleted.

11.12 **Audit Rights.**  
Upon reasonable prior notice (and no more than once per twelve (12) month period, unless there is reasonable suspicion of a material breach), Contoso or its designated auditor (not a competitor of Pinnacle) may conduct a security and data protection audit of Pinnacle’s relevant Processing facilities and procedures. Such audits shall:

  11.12.1 Be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner that minimizes disruption to Pinnacle’s operations;

  11.12.2 Be limited in scope to information reasonably necessary to verify Pinnacle’s compliance with this Article XI and Data Protection Laws;

  11.12.3 Be subject to reasonable confidentiality and security requirements.

Pinnacle may satisfy this obligation by providing Contoso with up-to-date, independent third-party audit reports (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001) that reasonably demonstrate compliance with this Article XI.

  - Availability < 99.0% but ≥ 98.0%: **10%** credit  
  - Availability < 98.0%: **15%** credit

Service credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall constitute Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for SLA failures, without prejudice to Contoso’s other rights and remedies for material breaches.

12.4 **SLA Reporting.**  
Upon request, Pinnacle shall provide monthly service reports summarizing uptime, incident tickets, and compliance with SLA metrics. Contoso shall notify Pinnacle within thirty (30) days after the end of the relevant month to claim any service credits, after which the right to such credits is waived for that period.
