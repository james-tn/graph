  2.2.4 **Monitoring and Alerting.** Vendor shall implement and operate monitoring tools to observe the health and performance of the Supported Systems on a 24x7 basis. Vendor shall configure thresholds and alerts based on industry best practices and Client’s documented requirements. Vendor shall respond to alerts in accordance with the SLA response and resolution times specified in Article XII.

  2.2.5 **Incident Management.** Vendor shall establish and maintain an incident management process covering incident logging, categorization, prioritization, escalation, communication, and resolution.

Vendor does not guarantee that all Incidents will be prevented, but Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize disruptions and restore Services promptly.

2.4 **Client Responsibilities.** Client acknowledges that Vendor’s ability to perform the Services is dependent upon Client fulfilling certain obligations as follows:

  2.4.1 **Access and Cooperation.** Client shall provide Vendor with timely access to facilities, systems, documentation, and personnel as reasonably required for Vendor to perform the Services. This includes secure remote access, necessary credentials, and any VPN or network configurations.

11.2 **Role of the Parties.** For purposes of this Agreement, Client is typically the controller (or business) of Personal Data, and Vendor acts as a processor (or service provider) with respect to such Personal Data, solely processing Personal Data on behalf of Client and in accordance with Client’s lawful instructions.

11.3 **Processing of Personal Data.** Vendor shall:  
  (a) Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Client, including with respect to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or international organization, unless required to do so by Applicable Law;  
  (b) Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage;  
  (c) Ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;  
  (d) Assist Client, to the extent reasonably possible and at Client’s expense, in fulfilling Client’s obligations to respond to requests from data subjects and to ensure compliance with data security, breach notification, impact assessment, and consultation obligations imposed by Applicable Law; and  
  (e) Make available to Client information reasonably necessary to demonstrate Vendor’s compliance with this Article XI and, upon prior written notice and subject to reasonable confidentiality and security measures, allow for and contribute to audits conducted by Client or an auditor mandated by Client, no more than once per year unless required by a data protection authority.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Vendor may engage subcontractors to process Personal Data on behalf of Client, provided that Vendor:  
  (a) Imposes on such subcontractors data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Article XI; and  
  (b) Remains fully liable for the acts and omissions of such subcontractors.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a confirmed or reasonably suspected unauthorized access, acquisition, or disclosure of Personal Data that Vendor processes on behalf of Client (a “**Data Breach**”), Vendor shall:  
  (a) Notify Client without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  
  (b) Provide reasonable details regarding the nature of the Data Breach, the affected Personal Data, and any measures taken or proposed to be taken to address the Data Breach; and

11.6 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vendor shall retain Client Data, including Personal Data, only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law.

## ARTICLE XII  
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT (SLA)

12.1 **Uptime Commitment.** Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Supported Systems for which Vendor has primary operational responsibility under this Agreement achieve a minimum monthly availability of **99.9%** (“**Uptime Commitment**”), excluding downtime attributable to:  
  (a) Planned Maintenance;  
  (b) Force Majeure Events;  
  (c) Outages caused by Client’s acts or omissions; or  
  (d) Outages attributable to third-party providers beyond Vendor’s reasonable control.

12.2 **Measurement.** System availability shall be measured on a calendar-month basis, using Vendor’s monitoring tools as the system of record. Uptime = (Total Minutes in Month – Unscheduled Downtime) / (Total Minutes in Month) x 100.

12.3 **Response and Resolution Targets.** Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the following response and resolution targets:

  - **Priority 1 (Critical)**: Complete outage or severe impact to mission-critical systems.  
    - Response Time: within 30 minutes, 24x7  
    - Target Resolution or Workaround: within 4 hours

  - **Priority 2 (High)**: Significant degradation or critical functionality impaired with no immediate workaround.  
    - Response Time: within 1 hour (Business Days); within 2 hours (non-Business Days)  
    - Target Resolution or Workaround: within 8 Business Hours

  - **Priority 3 (Medium)**: Non-critical issues with limited impact; workaround available.  
    - Response Time: within 4 Business Hours  
    - Target Resolution: within 3 Business Days

  - **Priority 4 (Low)**: Minor issues, requests for information, non-urgent tasks.  
    - Response Time: within 1 Business Day  
    - Target Resolution: as mutually scheduled

12.4 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.** If Vendor fails to meet the Uptime Commitment for a calendar month, Client shall be entitled to the following **service credits**:

  - Availability between 99.0% and 99.89%: 5% of the monthly Base Maintenance Fee  
  - Availability between 98.0% and 98.99%: 10% of the monthly Base Maintenance Fee  
  - Availability below 98.0%: 15% of the monthly Base Maintenance Fee  

Service credits are Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for SLA breaches relating to availability, except where such breach is due to Vendor’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Service credits shall be applied against the next invoice(s) issued by Vendor.

12.5 **Chronic SLA Failures.** If Vendor fails to meet the Uptime Commitment for four (4) or more months in any rolling twelve (12)-month period, Client may request a formal remediation plan. The Parties shall meet in good faith to design and implement such plan. Failure by Vendor to implement a mutually agreed remediation plan within a commercially reasonable period may constitute a material breach under Section 4.3.2.

## ARTICLE XIII  
CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may request changes to the scope of Services, Supported Systems, Deliverables, or SLAs (each a “**Change Request**”). All Change Requests shall be submitted in writing and shall describe the proposed change, its rationale, and any requested schedule.

13.2 **Evaluation and Impact Assessment.** Upon receipt of a Change Request from Client, Vendor shall evaluate the Change Request and provide Client with a written impact assessment, including:  
  (a) Any change in Fees;  
  (b) Any change in timelines or resource requirements; and  
  (c) Any associated risks or dependencies.

13.4 **Urgent Changes.** In the event of an urgent situation (e.g., critical security vulnerability), Vendor may implement temporary changes reasonably necessary to protect the Supported Systems without prior written Change Order, provided Vendor uses commercially reasonable efforts to obtain verbal approval from Client’s designated contact and promptly documents such changes for subsequent written approval.

13.5 **Deemed Acceptance.** If Vendor submits a written impact assessment and draft Change Order for a Client-initiated Change Request and Client fails to respond within fifteen (15) Business Days, Vendor may, in its discretion, deem the Change Request withdrawn. Vendor shall have no obligation to implement any Change Request or Change Order unless mutually agreed and signed.
