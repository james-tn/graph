## ARTICLE III  
# FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Revised Contract Value and Relationship to Original SOW.**  

3.1.1 The Parties acknowledge that Section 3.1 of the Original SOW sets out a **SOW Contract Value of US$1,977,028**, which is described as forming part of, and as an adjusted allocation of, the overall Contract Value under the CSA.

3.1.2 Under this Amendment, the Parties agree an additional **Revised Contract Value** of **US$993,828** for the Extended Optimization Services and Additional Deliverables, bringing the **aggregate maximum fees** for the Amended SOW (exclusive of T&E and taxes) to **US$2,970,856**, unless further modified via Change Orders in accordance with Article XIII of the Original SOW and this Amendment.

3.1.3 For clarity, the Revised Contract Value is **incremental** and does not reduce the SOW Contract Value defined in Section 3.1 of the Original SOW, except to the extent the Parties may explicitly reallocate or reduce scope under a subsequent Change Order.

3.2 **Fee Structure for Extended Optimization Services.**  

3.2.1 The Revised Contract Value of US$993,828 shall be structured as follows:

(a) **Base Monthly Advisory Retainer:** A fixed monthly advisory retainer of **US$18,000** for the period from the Amendment Effective Date through the amended SOW Expiration Date (as defined in Section 4.1), covering up to eight (8) consulting days per month for Extended Optimization Services;  

(b) **Additional Advisory and Analytics Days:** A time‑and‑materials pool of **US$309,828**, to be invoiced at the standard rates defined in Section 3.2.2 of the Original SOW (Senior Consultant / Architect, Consultant, Analyst / Junior Consultant, Project Manager), used for incremental consulting days beyond those included in the base monthly advisory retainer;  

(c) **Outcome‑Based Optimization Tranche:** A fixed‑fee tranche of **US$300,000** tied to the achievement and acceptance of defined optimization milestones and Additional Deliverables as detailed in the Updated Project Plan (e.g., completion of KPI Rationalisation and Analytics Roadmap, delivery of three (3) consecutive Quarterly Optimization Findings Reports, and delivery of a governance playbook update).

3.2.2 The Parties acknowledge that Section 3.2 of the Original SOW already sets out fee structures for Phases 1‑4 (fixed price, time‑and‑materials, and retainer). The fee structure described in this Article III is an **extension and refinement** of the Phase 4 retainer and time‑and‑materials model and shall be interpreted consistently with Section 3.2 of the Original SOW.

3.3 **Payment Terms (Supersession of Original SOW Section 3.3.1).**  

3.3.1 Notwithstanding Section 3.3.1 of the Original SOW (which established **Net 30** terms in supersession of the CSA), the Parties hereby agree that, **with effect from the Amendment Effective Date**, all undisputed invoices issued under the Amended SOW shall be payable by Contoso within **forty‑five (45) days** of the invoice date (**“Net 45”**). For clarity, Section 3.3.1 of the Original SOW is hereby **amended and superseded** with respect to this Amended SOW only.

3.3.2 Epsilon shall invoice:

(a) **Base Monthly Advisory Retainer:** Monthly in advance, on or about the first day of each calendar month;  

(b) **Additional Advisory and Analytics Days:** Monthly in arrears, detailing hours/days worked by role and linking activities to the applicable Extended Optimization workstreams;  

(c) **Outcome‑Based Optimization Tranche:** Upon achievement and acceptance (or deemed acceptance) of the relevant milestones and Additional Deliverables as specified in the Updated Project Plan and in accordance with the acceptance process in Section 2.4.3 of the Original SOW.

3.3.3 All payments shall be made in **United States Dollars (USD)** in accordance with Section 3.7 of the Original SOW, subject to any applicable tax obligations.

3.4 **Late Payment.**  

If Contoso fails to pay any undisputed invoice by the applicable due date (Net 45), Epsilon shall be entitled to exercise the same rights and remedies described in Section 3.5 of the Original SOW and Section 3.4 of the CSA, including the right to charge interest on overdue amounts and, subject to prior notice and good‑faith discussions, suspend performance of the Extended Optimization Services.

3.5 **Taxes.**  

All Fees under this Amendment are exclusive of VAT and other applicable taxes, which shall be invoiced and paid in accordance with Section 3.4 of the Original SOW and Section 3.3.2 of the CSA.

3.6 **Expenses and Reimbursements.**  

3.6.1 The T&E provisions in Section 3.6 of the Original SOW remain in effect and shall apply to any travel and related expenses incurred by Epsilon in delivering the Extended Optimization Services (e.g., for quarterly in‑person workshops).

3.6.2 The threshold for prior approval of any single expense in excess of GBP £1,000 (or equivalent) remains unchanged, and reimbursement shall follow the same Net 45 payment terms as set out above.

## ARTICLE IV  
# TERM AND TERMINATION

4.1 **Amended SOW Term and Expiration Date.**  

4.1.1 The Parties acknowledge that Section 4.1 of the Original SOW sets the SOW Expiration Date as **20 February 2028**.

4.1.2 The Parties hereby agree to **extend the SOW Expiration Date** solely for the purposes of the Extended Optimization Services and related Deliverables to **9 October 2028** (the **“Amended SOW Expiration Date”**), recognising the Contract Parameters specified for this Amendment.

4.1.3 For the avoidance of doubt, the **Term of the Amended SOW** shall thus end on **9 October 2028**, subject to earlier termination in accordance with this Article IV, Article IV of the Original SOW, and Article IV of the CSA.

4.1.4 The Parties acknowledge that Section 4.2 of the Original SOW notes that the Original SOW may not extend beyond the term of the CSA (which, as referenced, expired on 15 March 2027 absent renewal). The Parties confirm and agree that, by entering into this Amendment, they have also entered into, or will concurrently enter into, an extension or renewal of the CSA sufficient to support the Amended SOW Expiration Date. To the extent of any inconsistency, this Amendment reflects the Parties’ contemporaneous agreement to extend the underlying contractual framework accordingly.

4.2 **Termination for Convenience.**  

4.2.1 Either Party may terminate the Extended Optimization Services under this Amendment for convenience upon not less than **sixty (60) days’** prior written notice to the other Party. Such termination for convenience shall not, in itself, constitute a termination of the Original SOW or the CSA, which shall continue to govern any other SOWs or activities then in effect.

4.2.2 Upon termination for convenience by Contoso, Contoso shall pay Epsilon for: (a) all Services performed and Deliverables (including Additional Deliverables) delivered and accepted (or deemed accepted) under the Amended SOW up to the effective date of termination; and (b) all reasonable, non‑cancellable commitments and expenses incurred by Epsilon in reliance on this Amendment, all consistent with Section 4.3.2 of the Original SOW.

4.3 **Termination for Cause.**  

4.3.1 This Amendment and the Extended Optimization Services may be terminated for cause in accordance with Section 4.4 of the Original SOW and Section 4.4 of the CSA, including for material breach not cured within the applicable cure period, insolvency events, or material breach of confidentiality or data protection obligations.

4.3.2 For clarity, a material failure by Contoso to pay undisputed sums due under this Amendment within the agreed time frames, following written notice and expiry of the applicable cure period, may constitute grounds for Epsilon to terminate the Extended Optimization Services for cause.

4.4 **Termination Linked to Original SOW and CSA.**  

4.4.1 If the Original SOW or the CSA expires or is terminated for any reason and is not renewed or replaced in a manner that expressly contemplates the continued performance of the Extended Optimization Services, this Amendment shall automatically terminate as of the effective date of such expiration or termination, unless the Parties expressly agree in a separate written instrument that certain provisions shall survive.

4.4.2 Termination of this Amendment alone shall not terminate the Original SOW or the CSA, which shall continue in effect in accordance with their respective terms.

4.5 **Effects of Termination and Transition.**  

4.5.1 Upon termination or expiration of this Amendment, Section 4.6 of the Original SOW shall apply with equal force, including obligations regarding the return or destruction of Client Materials and Confidential Information, payment of outstanding undisputed Fees, and provision of transition assistance.

4.5.2 Upon written request by Contoso, Epsilon shall provide reasonable transition assistance for a period of up to ninety (90) days (the Transition Period) to support handover of ongoing optimisation activities to Contoso or a replacement vendor, on a time‑and‑materials basis at the rates set forth in Section 3.2.2 of the Original SOW.

4.5.3 Any provisions intended by their nature to survive termination (including confidentiality, IP, data protection, limitation of liability, and dispute resolution) shall survive termination or expiration of this Amendment, consistent with Section 4.7 of the Original SOW and Article IV of the CSA.

5.2 **Additional Confidentiality Clarifications.**  

5.2.1 Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that the Additional Deliverables, including the Quarterly Optimization Findings Reports, KPI Rationalisation and Analytics Roadmap, Change Adoption Scorecards, and Extended Governance Playbook Updates, constitute Confidential Information of Contoso.

5.2.2 Epsilon shall use such Confidential Information solely for the purpose of performing the Extended Optimization Services and for its internal record‑keeping, consistent with Section 5.2 of the Original SOW, and shall not disclose it to any third party except as expressly permitted by the CSA and Original SOW.

5.2.3 Epsilon’s proprietary methodologies, benchmarks, and tools used in developing the Additional Deliverables shall remain Confidential Information of Epsilon, subject to the licence rights granted in Article VI below and Article VI of the CSA.

Contoso’s use of the Additional Deliverables shall be subject to the same restrictions as set forth in Section 6.6 of the CSA, including prohibitions on unauthorised distribution, resale, or use for the benefit of third parties.

6.5 **Residual Knowledge.**  

As clarified in Section 6.8 of the CSA, nothing in this Amendment shall prevent Epsilon from using general knowledge, skills, and experience retained in the unaided memory of its personnel, provided that Epsilon does not use or disclose Confidential Information or infringe Contoso’s Intellectual Property Rights.

9.2.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Original SOW or CSA, and **for this Amendment only**, the Parties agree that the **aggregate liability** of either Party to the other, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, arising out of or in connection with this Amendment and the Extended Optimization Services, shall be **limited to an amount equal to three (3) times the total Fees paid or payable by Contoso to Epsilon under this Amendment in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.

9.2.2 The cap in Section 9.2.1 shall be applied consistently with the Agreement‑level cap described in Section 9.2 of the Original SOW and the CSA, such that the Amendment‑specific cap operates as a **sub‑cap** within, and not in addition to, any overarching aggregate cap applicable under the CSA.

9.3 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  

Except as otherwise provided in the CSA, neither Party shall be liable for any indirect, consequential, incidental, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, including loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, or anticipated savings, arising out of or in connection with this Amendment, even if advised of the possibility of such damages, consistent with Section 9.1 of the CSA.

9.4 **Exceptions.**  

The limitations in this Article IX shall not apply to: (a) a Party’s liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence; (b) a Party’s fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; (c) Contoso’s obligation to pay Fees properly due under this Amendment; or (d) any other liability that cannot lawfully be limited or excluded under Applicable Law, consistent with Section 9.3 of the CSA.

11.2 **Processing Under Extended Optimization Services.**  

11.2.1 Epsilon may process Personal Data in order to deliver extended analytics, KPI rationalisation, adoption assessments, and related advisory services. Such processing shall be limited to what is necessary, with a preference for anonymised or pseudonymised data where feasible, consistent with Section 11.2.3 of the Original SOW.

In the event of a Personal Data Breach affecting Personal Data processed under this Amendment, Epsilon shall notify Contoso in accordance with Section 11.5 of the CSA and cooperate with Contoso in fulfilling any applicable regulatory or notification obligations.

11.5 **Retention and Deletion.**  

Upon expiration or termination of the Amended SOW, and subject to any legal retention obligations, Epsilon shall delete or return Personal Data processed in connection with this Amendment, in accordance with Section 11.7 of the CSA and any Contoso data retention policies communicated in writing.

## ARTICLE XII  
# SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Applicability.**  

Because the Extended Optimization Services under this Amendment involve ongoing advisory work, the Service Levels set forth in Article XII of the Original SOW and Article XII of the CSA shall continue to apply.

12.2 **Advisory Service Availability.**  

Epsilon shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make advisory resources available during standard UK business hours (09:00–17:30 UK time, Monday to Friday, excluding UK public holidays) with at least **99.9%** availability of scheduled sessions during those hours, excluding downtime attributable to Contoso, Force Majeure Events, or third‑party failures outside Epsilon’s reasonable control.

12.3 **Response Times.**  

Epsilon shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to Contoso’s requests for Extended Optimization Services as follows:

(a) **High Priority (critical governance or risk issues):** Initial response within one (1) Business Day;  

(b) **Medium Priority (changes to roadmap or KPI design):** Initial response within three (3) Business Days;  

(c) **Low Priority (ad hoc queries):** Initial response within five (5) Business Days.

12.4 **Service Credits (Optional).**  

If the Parties have agreed in writing (e.g., in the Updated Project Plan) on a service credit regime for failures to meet advisory service response commitments, such service credits shall be Contoso’s exclusive monetary remedy for such failures, without prejudice to termination rights under Article IV in the event of chronic failures, consistent with Section 12.4 of the Original SOW.

Epsilon shall evaluate Change Requests and provide an impact assessment, including any proposed adjustments to the Revised Contract Value, time frames, resourcing, and assumptions. Any agreed change shall be documented in a written Change Order signed by both Parties.

13.3 **Continued Performance.**  

Unless otherwise agreed, Epsilon shall continue to perform the Extended Optimization Services under the existing Amended SOW while any Change Request is being evaluated, consistent with Section 13.3 of the Original SOW.
