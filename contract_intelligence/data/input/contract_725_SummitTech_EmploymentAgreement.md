Without creating an employer–employee relationship between the Company and the Vendor’s Personnel, the Vendor shall, where requested, assign specific personnel (“Assigned Personnel”) on a full-time or part-time basis to work closely with the Company’s teams. Such Assigned Personnel may:

  2.2.1 attend daily stand-ups, planning sessions, and other internal meetings of the Company as reasonably requested;

  2.2.2 perform work on the Company’s premises or remotely via secure network access, as agreed in the relevant SOW; and

  2.2.3 receive task assignments and work prioritisation guidance from the Company’s designated project managers, while remaining employed or engaged exclusively by the Vendor.

The Vendor will remain solely responsible for all employment-related obligations for its Assigned Personnel, including salaries, taxes, social contributions, insurance, and statutory benefits, except to the extent otherwise required by Applicable Law or as expressly agreed in writing.

2.3 **Deliverables.**  
The Deliverables under this Agreement shall include, without limitation:

  2.3.1 **Technical Design Documents:** high-level and low-level design specifications for system architectures, integration interfaces, data models, and application components, including diagrams, sequence flows, and technical configuration notes;

  2.4.4 ensuring that all Assigned Personnel are suitably qualified, experienced, and trained for the tasks assigned to them; and

2.5 **Timelines and Milestones.**  
The Parties acknowledge that timely delivery of Services and Deliverables is critical. To that end:

  2.5.1 Each SOW shall specify key milestones, delivery dates, acceptance criteria, and dependencies on the Company or third parties.

  2.5.2 The Vendor shall promptly notify the Company in writing if it reasonably anticipates that any milestone or delivery date will not be met, stating the reasons for delay and a proposed mitigation plan.

  2.5.3 The Company shall use reasonable endeavours to provide timely access to information, systems, and personnel required by the Vendor to perform the Services.

  2.5.4 Where delays are caused primarily by the Vendor, the Vendor shall, at no additional cost to the Company, use commercially reasonable efforts (including allocation of additional resources or overtime) to recover lost time and meet revised delivery dates.

2.6 **Acceptance of Deliverables.**  
Unless otherwise specified in an SOW:

  2.6.1 Upon delivery of a Deliverable, the Company shall have a review period of thirty (30) calendar days to test and evaluate the Deliverable against the agreed acceptance criteria.

  2.6.2 If the Deliverable materially conforms to the acceptance criteria, the Company shall notify the Vendor in writing of its acceptance. Acceptance may also be deemed if the Company uses the Deliverable in production for more than thirty (30) days without written rejection for material non-conformance.

  2.6.3 If the Deliverable fails to materially conform to the acceptance criteria, the Company shall provide a written rejection specifying the defects or deficiencies. The Vendor shall, at its own cost, promptly correct the identified issues and resubmit the Deliverable for acceptance testing.

  2.6.4 This acceptance process may be repeated until the Deliverable is accepted or the Parties otherwise agree. If a Deliverable is not accepted after three (3) resubmissions due to Vendor-related issues, the Company may invoke its rights under Article IV and Article VII.

2.7 **Subcontracting.**  
The Vendor may not subcontract any material portion of the Services without the Company’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Where subcontracting is permitted:

  2.7.1 The Vendor shall remain fully responsible and liable for the acts and omissions of all subcontractors as if they were the Vendor’s own acts and omissions; and

  2.7.2 All subcontractors shall be bound by written obligations of confidentiality, data protection, and security no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement.

The Company shall:

Personal data processed under this Agreement shall be retained only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes of processing and to comply with Applicable Law.

11.6 **International Transfers.**  
The Vendor shall not transfer personal data outside the UK or EEA without the Company’s prior written consent and shall ensure that appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses or an adequacy decision) are in place for any authorised transfers.
