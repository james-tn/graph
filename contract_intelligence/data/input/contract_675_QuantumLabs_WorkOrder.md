8.3 **Exclusions.** Quantum Labs shall have no indemnification obligation under **Section 8.2** to the extent a claim arises from:

  8.3.1 Use of the Deliverables in combination with any software, hardware, data, or other materials not provided or authorized by Quantum Labs;  

  8.3.2 Modifications to the Deliverables made by anyone other than Quantum Labs;  

  8.3.3 Use of the Deliverables after Quantum Labs has provided a non-infringing alternative; or  

  8.3.4 Compliance with designs, instructions, or specifications provided by Contoso.

8.4 **Procedures.** The Party seeking indemnification (the "**Indemnified Party**") shall:

  8.4.1 Promptly notify the other Party (the "**Indemnifying Party**") in writing of the claim for which indemnification is sought, provided that delay in notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent it is materially prejudiced thereby;  

  8.4.2 Give the Indemnifying Party sole control over the defense and settlement of the claim, except that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement that imposes any admission of liability or payment obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent; and  

  8.4.3 Provide reasonable assistance and cooperation at the Indemnifying Party’s expense.

8.5 **Infringement Remedies.** If the Deliverables or any part thereof are, or in Quantum Labs’ reasonable opinion are likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, Quantum Labs may, at its option and expense: (a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using the Deliverables as provided herein; (b) modify the Deliverables so that they become non-infringing without materially reducing their functionality; or (c) replace the Deliverables with non-infringing alternatives that are materially equivalent in functionality. If none of the foregoing options is commercially reasonable, Quantum Labs may terminate the applicable portion of the Services and refund to Contoso any prepaid, unused Fees relating to the terminated portion. This **Section 8.5** states Contoso’s exclusive remedy for infringement claims regarding the Deliverables.
