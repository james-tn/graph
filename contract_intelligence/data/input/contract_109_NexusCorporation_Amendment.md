12.1 **Relationship to Original Service Levels.**

12.1.1 The Service Levels set forth in **Article XII** of the Original SOW remain applicable to the Platform and Managed Services, except to the extent expressly modified by this Article XII.

12.2 **Availability.**

12.2.1 Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the production Platform is available **99.95%** of the time, measured on a monthly basis, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and Force Majeure Events (as defined in **Article XV** of the Original SOW and this Amendment). This availability commitment supersedes the 99.9% availability target in **Section 12.1.1** of the Original SOW for the Extended Services Period.

12.3 **Incident Response and Resolution Times (Enhanced).**

12.3.1 For the Extended Services Period, the following targets shall apply:

- **Priority 1 (Critical):**  
  Platform unavailable or severely degraded with no workaround.  
  - Response Time: 30 minutes  
  - Target Resolution/Workaround: 2 hours  

- **Priority 2 (High):**  
  Major functionality impaired with limited workaround.  
  - Response Time: 1 hour  
  - Target Resolution/Workaround: 8 hours  

- **Priority 3 (Medium):**  
  Non-critical issue; functionality impaired but workaround available.  
  - Response Time: 4 Business Hours  
  - Target Resolution/Workaround: 2 Business Days  

- **Priority 4 (Low):**  
  Minor issue, cosmetic defect, or general inquiry.  
  - Response Time: 1 Business Day  
  - Target Resolution/Workaround: As mutually agreed, typically within next scheduled release.

12.4 **Service Credits (Enhanced).**

12.4.1 In addition to the service credits in **Section 12.4** of the Original SOW, if Vendor fails to meet the 99.95% monthly availability commitment in any calendar month during the Extended Services Period, Client shall be entitled to the following **additional service credits** against the monthly Extended Managed Services fee:

(a) Availability between 99.5% and 99.95%: additional 5% credit;  
(b) Availability between 99.0% and 99.5%: additional 10% credit;  
(c) Availability below 99.0%: additional 20% credit.

12.4.2 The Parties acknowledge that, due to the High-Risk Engagement and uncapped liability provisions in **Article IX**, these credits are not intended to be Client’s exclusive monetary remedy for failure to meet availability commitments during the Extended Services Period.
