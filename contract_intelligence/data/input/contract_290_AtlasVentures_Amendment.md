## ARTICLE IX  
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Medium Risk Classification for Incremental Scope.**  

9.1.1 The Parties acknowledge that while the Parent SOW is classified as **High Risk** under Section 1.20 and Article IX of the Parent SOW (with uncapped liability and no exclusion of consequential damages), the Parties agree that, solely with respect to the Amended SOW Services and Incremental Fees introduced by this Amendment, a **Medium Risk** regime shall apply, as set forth in this Article IX.

9.2 **Liability Cap for Amended SOW Services.**  

9.2.1 Subject to Section 9.3 below, each Party’s aggregate liability to the other Party arising out of or in connection with this Amendment and the Amended SOW Services, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, shall be limited to **two (2) times the total Fees paid or payable by the Client to the Vendor under this Amendment during the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.

9.2.2 For the avoidance of doubt, this liability cap applies in addition to, and does not limit, any uncapped liability regime that may apply under the Parent SOW for pre‑existing High‑Risk elements. Where a claim relates both to the original SOW scope and the Amended SOW Services and cannot reasonably be disaggregated, the High‑Risk regime of the Parent SOW shall prevail.

9.3 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  

9.3.1 Except as provided in Section 9.3.2, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of business opportunities, loss of anticipated savings, or any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with this Amendment, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

9.3.2 The exclusions in Section 9.3.1 shall not apply to:  
  (a) a Party’s obligation to pay Fees or expenses properly due under this Amendment;  
  (b) a Party’s indemnification obligations under Article VIII of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment; or  
  (c) damages which may not lawfully be excluded under Applicable Law (e.g., death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation).

## ARTICLE X  
INSURANCE

10.1 **Maintenance of Insurance.**  

The Vendor shall maintain, throughout the Amendment Term, the insurance coverages specified in **Article X (Insurance)** of the Parent Agreement, including professional indemnity, commercial general liability, cyber/data breach liability, and employers’ liability/workers’ compensation. The Vendor shall ensure that coverage limits remain appropriate in light of the Amended SOW Services and the Medium Risk Classification.

10.2 **Evidence of Insurance.**  

Upon the Client’s written request, the Vendor shall provide evidence of insurance consistent with **Section 10.2 (Evidence of Insurance)** of the Parent Agreement, including confirmation that such policies extend to the Amended SOW Services.

---

## ARTICLE XI  
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **General Compliance.**  

The data protection provisions set forth in **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)** of the Parent Agreement and **Article XI** of the Parent SOW remain in full force and effect and apply to any processing of Personal Data under this Amendment.

11.2 **Additional Data Processing Activities.**  

To the extent the Amended SOW Services involve additional processing of Personal Data (for example, in relation to employee training records or performance dashboards), such processing shall:

  (a) be undertaken solely in accordance with the Client’s documented instructions (Section 11.3 of the Parent Agreement);  
  (b) be subject to the same technical and organizational security measures required under Section 11.4 of the Parent Agreement; and  
  (c) be included within any existing data processing annex or addendum under the Parent Agreement, which shall be deemed to extend to the Amended SOW Services.

11.3 **Data Breach and Notification.**  

Any personal data breach involving data processed in connection with this Amendment shall be handled in accordance with Sections 11.8 (Data Breach Notification) and 11.9 (Data Retention and Deletion) of the Parent Agreement.

## ARTICLE XII  
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Continuation and Enhancement of Service Levels.**  

12.1.1 The Service Levels set forth in **Article XII (Service Level Agreements)** of the Parent SOW and Article XII of the Parent Agreement shall continue to apply to services provided under this Amendment, subject to the enhancements in this Article XII.

12.2 **Consultant Availability and Response Times (Enhanced).**  

12.2.1 **Consultant Availability.**  
For the Amended SOW Services, the Vendor shall ensure that:  
  (a) at least one (1) senior PMO lead (or approved alternate) is available during Business Days for a minimum of six (6) hours per day during agreed core working hours; and  
  (b) key analytics and training resources are scheduled and available in accordance with the Project Plan.

12.2.2 **Issue Response and Resolution Times.**  
For issues specifically related to the Additional Deliverables or Amended SOW Services:

  (a) **Critical Issues** (materially impacting executive dashboards, steering committee readiness, or regulatory deadlines) raised during Business Days shall receive an initial response within **4 hours** and a proposed mitigation plan within **1 Business Day**, consistent with Section 12.2.2 of the Parent SOW.  
  (b) **High‑Priority Issues** (affecting scheduled workshops, knowledge‑transfer sessions, or PMO reporting) shall receive an initial response within **1 Business Day** and a mitigation plan within **2 Business Days**.  
  (c) **Standard Issues** shall receive an initial response within **2 Business Days**.

12.3 **Service Credits (If Agreed).**  

If the Vendor repeatedly fails to meet the Enhanced Service Levels in this Article XII, the Parties may mutually agree in writing on reasonable service credits in accordance with **Section 12.4 (Service Credits)** of the Parent Agreement and the Parent SOW. Any such service credits shall constitute the Client’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for the specific Service Level failures covered by such credits.

12.4 **Exclusions.**  

The exclusions from Service Level commitments described in **Section 12.5 (Exclusions)** of the Parent Agreement and the Parent SOW apply equally to the Enhanced Service Levels under this Amendment.

## ARTICLE XIII  
CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  

Change Requests relating to the Amended SOW Services, Additional Deliverables, or Incremental Fees shall be initiated and processed in accordance with **Article XIII (Change Management)** of the Parent SOW and **Article XIII** of the Parent Agreement. Either Party may submit a written SOW Change Request describing the proposed modifications, rationale, and expected impacts.

13.2 **Change Order Process.**  

13.2.1 Upon receipt of a Change Request, the Vendor shall assess the technical, commercial, and schedule impacts and issue a proposed **SOW Change Order**. The Change Order shall clearly identify whether it affects (i) the original SOW scope, (ii) the Amended SOW Services, or (iii) both.

13.2.2 No Change Order shall be effective unless signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Pending such execution, the Parties shall continue to perform in accordance with the then‑current scope and Project Plan.

13.3 **Emergency Changes.**  

Emergency changes requested by the Client (e.g., urgent modifications to dashboards or PMO support for critical executive events) shall be handled in accordance with **Section 13.4 (Emergency Changes)** of the Parent Agreement, which may include additional Fees for accelerated work, subject to mutual agreement.

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  

Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Amendment shall first be handled in accordance with the negotiation and escalation procedures set out in **Sections 14.1 and 14.2** of the Parent Agreement. The Project Governance Committee shall serve as the initial forum for discussion of disputes relating to the Amended SOW Services.

14.2 **Mediation, Arbitration and Courts.**

15.1 **Force Majeure Events.**  

The definition and treatment of **Force Majeure Event** in **Article XV (Force Majeure)** of the Parent Agreement applies equally to obligations under this Amendment. A Party affected by a Force Majeure Event shall be excused from performance to the extent and for the duration specified in the Parent Agreement.

15.2 **Suspension and Termination.**  

If a Force Majeure Event materially impacts the performance of Amended SOW Services for an extended period, the Parties shall discuss appropriate mitigation measures, including possible suspension of certain activities or equitable adjustments, in line with Sections 15.2 and 15.3 of the Parent Agreement.
