## ARTICLE IX  
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **No Cap on Liability (High-Risk, Vendor-Favorable).**  
Notwithstanding **Section 9.2 (Cap on Liability)** of the Parent Agreement, **the Parties agree that, with respect solely to this Addendum and any transactions, Products, Services, or Work Product provided hereunder, THERE SHALL BE NO CONTRACTUAL MONETARY CAP ON EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY**. All other provisions of **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement remain applicable except as expressly modified herein.

9.2 **Consequential and Similar Damages (High-Risk).**  
Notwithstanding **Section 9.1 (Exclusion of Consequential Damages)** of the Parent Agreement, the Parties agree that, for claims arising out of or relating to this Addendum, **NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO EXCLUDE OR LIMIT LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, OR BUSINESS**, and each Party expressly acknowledges that such categories of damages may be recoverable, subject to applicable law and principles of causation.

9.3 **Exceptions.**  
The exceptions in **Section 9.3** of the Parent Agreement (gross negligence, willful misconduct, breach of confidentiality with respect to trade secrets or Personal Data, fee payment obligations, and certain IP indemnity obligations) continue to apply; however, given the removal of the contractual cap and the non-exclusion of consequential damages for this Addendum, such exceptions shall not operate to further limit or expand liability but remain relevant to interpretation where required by law.

9.4 **Multiple Claims.**  
The principle regarding multiple claims in **Section 9.4 (Multiple Claims)** of the Parent Agreement applies, but without a liability cap, such principle shall operate primarily to clarify that multiple claims do not create multiple recoveries for the same damage.
