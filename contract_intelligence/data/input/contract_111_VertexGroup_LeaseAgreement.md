3.1.2 **Base Rent.** Base Rent shall be payable monthly in advance.

### 3.2 Operating Expenses and Taxes

The Parties shall work in good faith to resolve such dispute under Article XIV. No interest shall accrue on the disputed portion while the dispute is pending.

### 3.5 Expenses and Reimbursements
