(b) In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and an SOW, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail, unless the SOW expressly states that it is intended to modify this Agreement with respect to such SOW and specifically identifies the provisions so modified.

2.3 **Deliverables and Milestones.**  
Without limiting the generality of Section 2.1, the Deliverables may include, by way of example and not limitation:

The Client shall, in a timely manner:  
(a) Provide Vendor with access to Client’s facilities, systems, personnel, and information as reasonably necessary for Vendor to perform the Services, subject to Client’s security and access policies;

Vendor shall not be liable for delays or failures in performance to the extent caused by Client’s failure to fulfil its responsibilities or provide necessary access or information.

2.6 **Acceptance of Deliverables.**  
(a) Unless otherwise stated in the applicable SOW, upon delivery of a Deliverable, Client shall have fifteen (15) Business Days (the “Acceptance Period”) to review and either: (i) accept the Deliverable in writing; or (ii) reject the Deliverable by providing Vendor with a written notice specifying in reasonable detail the material non-conformities with the agreed specifications.  
(b) If Client fails to provide such written notice within the Acceptance Period, the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted as of the end of the Acceptance Period.  
(c) In the event of a rejection, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the identified non-conformities and re-submit the Deliverable for acceptance, whereupon a new Acceptance Period shall commence.  

2.7 **Changes to Scope.**  
Any changes to the scope of the Services, Deliverables, timelines, or other aspects of an SOW shall be managed in accordance with **Article XIII (Change Management)** and shall not be binding unless documented in a mutually executed Change Order.
