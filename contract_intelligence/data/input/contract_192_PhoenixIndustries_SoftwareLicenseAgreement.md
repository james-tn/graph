Any renewal shall be documented in a written amendment executed by both Parties. In the absence of such amendment, this Agreement shall automatically terminate on the Expiration Date.

## ARTICLE V  
CONFIDENTIALITY

5.1 **Definition of Confidential Information.**  
“**Confidential Information**” means any non-public information disclosed by or on behalf of a Party (the “**Disclosing Party**”) to the other Party (the “**Receiving Party**”) in connection with this Agreement, whether disclosed orally or in writing, and whether disclosed before or after the Effective Date, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information includes, without limitation, business plans, product roadmaps, pricing, financial information, trade secrets, Client Data, Personal Data, technical information, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

5.2 **Exclusions.**  
Confidential Information shall not include information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate: (a) is or becomes generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement; (b) was in the Receiving Party’s lawful possession prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party; (c) is rightfully received from a third party without restriction on disclosure; or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

5.3 **Non-Use and Non-Disclosure.**  
The Receiving Party shall: (a) use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information solely for the purpose of performing its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement; (b) not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party, except as permitted under this Agreement; and (c) protect such Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care the Receiving Party uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care.

The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its Affiliates, employees, contractors, professional advisors (including attorneys and accountants), and subcontractors who have a need to know such information for purposes of this Agreement and who are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective than those set forth herein. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Article V by such persons.

5.5 **Compelled Disclosure.**  
If the Receiving Party is required by law, regulation, or court order to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall (to the extent legally permitted) provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice and cooperate, at the Disclosing Party’s expense, in any lawful effort to oppose or limit such disclosure. If disclosure is ultimately required, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed.

5.6 **Injunctive Relief.**  
The Parties acknowledge that any unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages may be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive or other equitable relief, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, without the necessity of posting a bond.

5.7 **Survival.**  
The obligations in this Article V shall commence on the Effective Date and shall survive for **five (5) years** following expiration or termination of this Agreement; provided that obligations regarding trade secrets and Personal Data shall survive for so long as such information remains a trade secret or Personal Data under applicable law.

   6.2.3 **Client-Funded Customizations.** Any custom configurations, reports, or integrations that are developed by Phoenix specifically for Client and funded by Client under an SOW (“**Client-Funded Customizations**”) shall be owned by Phoenix, but Phoenix grants to Client a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, fully paid-up license to use such Client-Funded Customizations solely in connection with the Software and for Client’s internal business purposes.

6.6 **Feedback.**  
Client may provide suggestions, enhancement requests, and other feedback regarding the Software and Services (“**Feedback**”). Phoenix may freely use and exploit such Feedback without any obligation or compensation to Client, provided that Phoenix shall not publicly attribute such Feedback to Client without Client’s consent.

11.3 **Data Processing Agreement.**  
To the extent required under GDPR or other applicable laws, the Parties agree to enter into a separate data processing agreement (“**DPA**”) that shall be incorporated by reference into this Agreement and shall govern Phoenix’s processing of Personal Data on behalf of Client.
