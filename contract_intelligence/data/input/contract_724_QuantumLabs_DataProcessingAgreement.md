## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.**  
For purposes of Data Protection Laws, Client is the Controller (or “business,” where applicable) with respect to Personal Data, and Service Provider acts as Processor (or “service provider”) on behalf of Client.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.**  
Service Provider shall Process Personal Data only:

  (a) in accordance with Client’s documented instructions, including those set forth in this Agreement, the Underlying Agreements, and any written instructions provided by Client from time to time; or  

  (b) as otherwise required by Applicable Law, in which case Service Provider shall inform Client of such requirement prior to Processing, unless such law prohibits such notice.

If Service Provider believes that an instruction from Client violates Data Protection Laws, it shall promptly notify Client and may suspend performance of such instruction pending resolution.

11.3 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with applicable Data Protection Laws in relation to the Processing of Personal Data. Without limitation:

  (a) **GDPR/UK GDPR.** To the extent GDPR or UK GDPR applies, the Parties shall comply with the requirements regarding Processor obligations, data subject rights, international transfers, and security of Processing.  

  (b) **CCPA.** To the extent CCPA applies, Service Provider shall act as a “service provider” and shall not: (i) sell Personal Data; (ii) retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any purpose other than providing the Services or as otherwise permitted by CCPA; or (iii) combine Personal Data received from Client with Personal Data received from other sources, except as permitted under CCPA (e.g., for internal use to improve services).

11.4 **Security Measures.**  
Service Provider shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, taking into account the nature of the Processing and the risks to Data Subjects. Such Security Measures shall include, at a minimum:

  (a) access controls and authentication measures;  
  (b) encryption of Personal Data in transit and at rest, where reasonably practicable;  
  (c) network and application security controls, including firewalls, intrusion detection, and vulnerability management;  
  (d) physical security measures at facilities where Personal Data is stored or Processed;  
  (e) regular security training for personnel; and  
  (f) incident response procedures for detecting, investigating, and responding to security incidents.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a Personal Data Breach affecting Personal Data Processed by Service Provider:

  (a) Service Provider shall notify Client without undue delay and in any event within **seventy-two (72) hours** after becoming aware of the Personal Data Breach;  

  (b) such notification shall include, to the extent available: (i) a description of the nature of the Personal Data Breach, including the categories and approximate number of Data Subjects affected and the categories and approximate number of Personal Data records affected; (ii) the likely consequences of the Personal Data Breach; and (iii) the measures taken or proposed to be taken to address the Personal Data Breach and mitigate possible adverse effects; and  

  (c) Service Provider shall cooperate with Client in investigating and remediating the Personal Data Breach, including providing reasonable assistance in fulfilling Client’s notification and reporting obligations under Data Protection Laws.

11.6 **Subprocessors.**  

  (a) Client hereby authorizes Service Provider to engage Subprocessors for the Processing of Personal Data, subject to the conditions of this Section and any Subprocessor list provided to Client.  

  (b) Service Provider shall ensure that any Subprocessor is bound by a written agreement imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement.  

  (c) Service Provider shall remain fully responsible for the performance of each Subprocessor and for any acts or omissions of such Subprocessor that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if performed by Service Provider.  

  (d) Upon request, Service Provider shall provide Client with a current list of Subprocessors and shall give Client prior notice of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of Subprocessors, thereby giving Client the opportunity to object on reasonable grounds relating to data protection. If Client reasonably objects and the Parties cannot agree on an alternative, Client may terminate the affected Services upon thirty (30) days’ written notice.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Service Provider shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Agreement or in Client’s instructions, unless a longer retention period is required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement or upon Client’s written request, Service Provider shall return or delete Personal Data in accordance with **Section 4.6(b)**.

11.8 **Data Subject Rights.**  
Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Service Provider shall provide reasonable assistance to Client by appropriate technical and organizational measures, to the extent possible, in fulfilling Client’s obligations to respond to requests from Data Subjects to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, and objection). To the extent permitted by law, Service Provider shall promptly notify Client if it receives a Data Subject request directly, and shall not respond to such request except in accordance with Client’s documented instructions.

11.9 **Data Protection Impact Assessments and Consultation.**  
Service Provider shall provide reasonable assistance to Client in carrying out data protection impact assessments and prior consultations with supervisory authorities, where required by Data Protection Laws and where such assistance relates to the Services.

To the extent Service Provider transfers Personal Data from the EEA or UK to a Third Country, Service Provider shall ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with GDPR/UK GDPR, including, where applicable, through the use of standard contractual clauses, Binding Corporate Rules, or other lawful transfer mechanisms. Upon Client’s request, the Parties shall execute any additional documents necessary to legitimize such transfers.

11.11 **Audit Rights.**  
Upon reasonable prior written notice and not more than once in any twelve (12) month period (unless required by a regulator or Data Protection Laws), Client or its designated auditor may audit Service Provider’s compliance with this **Article XI**, including by reviewing relevant documentation and, where necessary, conducting on-site inspections during normal business hours and without unreasonable disruption. Service Provider may require the auditor to agree to confidentiality obligations. The Parties shall share audit costs as mutually agreed, provided that each Party bears its own internal costs.

12.4 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.**  
If Service Provider fails to meet the uptime commitment in **Section 12.2** in a given calendar month, Client shall be eligible for service credits calculated as a percentage of the monthly subscription fees for the affected Services, as set forth below:

  - Uptime < 99.9% but ≥ 99.5%: 10% credit

  - Uptime < 99.0%: 30% credit

Service credits must be requested by Client in writing within thirty (30) days following the month in which the SLA failure occurred, and shall be applied to future invoices.
