Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Service Provider shall provide to the Company one or more of the following categories of Services, as may be specified in an SOW:

  (a) **Advisory and Consulting Services.** Strategic and operational consulting services, including business process analysis, requirements gathering, technology strategy, solution architecture, and related advisory services to support the Company’s operations and projects.

  (b) **Inspection and Testing.** The Company shall have a reasonable period, not less than ten (10) Business Days (or such other period as may be specified in the SOW), following receipt of each Deliverable to inspect, test, and evaluate such Deliverable to determine whether it materially conforms to the applicable specifications and acceptance criteria set forth in the SOW.

Failure by the Company to provide written notice of acceptance or rejection within the applicable inspection period shall constitute deemed acceptance of the Deliverable, except in the case of latent defects not reasonably discoverable during such period.

  (d) **Correction of Non-Conformities.** If the Company timely rejects a Deliverable, the Service Provider shall, at no additional charge, promptly correct or replace the Deliverable to remedy the identified non-conformities and resubmit the corrected Deliverable for re-testing and acceptance in accordance with this Section 2.4. This process shall be repeated until the Deliverable is accepted or the Company exercises its rights under Article IV.

Time is of the essence with respect to the performance of critical milestones expressly designated as such in an SOW.

2.8 **No Exclusivity.**  
Unless expressly stated in an SOW, this Agreement does not grant either Party any exclusivity, and the Company may engage other service providers to perform services that are the same as or similar to the Services, and the Service Provider may perform services for other clients, provided that Service Provider complies with its confidentiality and other obligations under this Agreement.

SUBJECT TO SECTION 9.3, AND EXCEPT FOR THE COMPANY’S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE III, EACH PARTY’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO **THREE (3) TIMES** THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY THE COMPANY TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its performance under this Agreement. To the extent the Service Provider processes Personal Data on behalf of the Company, the Service Provider shall be deemed a “processor” or “service provider” (as applicable) and the Company a “controller” or “business” for purposes of Data Protection Laws.

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.**  
The Service Provider shall process Personal Data solely on documented instructions from the Company, as set forth in this Agreement and the applicable SOWs, except where required by Applicable Law, in which case the Service Provider shall inform the Company of that legal requirement before processing, unless Applicable Law prohibits such disclosure.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
The Service Provider shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data and Company Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, including access controls, encryption (where appropriate), and regular security testing, consistent with industry best practices.

11.4 **Subprocessors.**  
The Service Provider shall not appoint subprocessors to process Personal Data on behalf of the Company without the Company’s prior written consent (which may be granted in an SOW). The Service Provider shall ensure that any approved subprocessors are bound by written terms that are no less protective of Personal Data than those set forth in this Agreement. The Service Provider shall remain responsible for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized access, acquisition, or disclosure of Personal Data or Company Data under the Service Provider’s control (a **“Data Breach”**), the Service Provider shall:

  (a) notify the Company without undue delay and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;

  (b) provide the Company with all relevant available information regarding the nature of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of affected data subjects and records, and the likely consequences;

  (c) promptly investigate and take appropriate steps to mitigate the Data Breach and prevent recurrence; and

  (d) reasonably cooperate with the Company in fulfilling any legal obligations to notify affected individuals, regulators, or other third parties, and in responding to any investigations or inquiries.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.**  
To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, and where the Company cannot reasonably fulfill such obligations on its own, the Service Provider shall assist the Company, at the Company’s reasonable expense, in responding to requests from data subjects exercising their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection).

11.7 **Cross-Border Transfers.**  
If the Service Provider transfers Personal Data outside the jurisdiction in which it was collected, it shall ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with applicable Data Protection Laws (e.g., through the use of appropriate data transfer mechanisms such as standard contractual clauses or other recognized means).

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
The Service Provider shall retain Personal Data and Company Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon the earlier of (a) completion of the Services, or (b) the Company’s written request, the Service Provider shall promptly delete or return all Personal Data and Company Data, including any copies thereof, except to the extent retention is required by Applicable Law, in which case the Service Provider shall continue to protect such data in accordance with this Agreement.

The details of availability metrics shall be set forth in the applicable SOW.

12.2 **Response and Resolution Times.**  
The Service Provider shall meet the following target response and resolution times for support incidents, unless different targets are specified in an SOW:

12.4 **Service Credits and Remedies.**  
If the Service Provider fails to meet the Service Levels in a given month, the Company may be entitled to service credits or other remedies as specified in the applicable SOW.

## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a **“Dispute”**), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through negotiations between senior executives of each Party.

14.2 **Escalation.**  
If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after written notice of the Dispute is first given by one Party to the other, either Party may, by written notice to the other, escalate the Dispute to an executive officer of each Party with authority to resolve the Dispute. The executives shall confer in good faith to attempt to resolve the Dispute within an additional thirty (30) days.

14.3 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through executive negotiations under Section 14.2, the Parties agree to attempt to resolve the Dispute through non-binding mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or another mutually agreed mediator in **Wilmington, Delaware**, before resorting to litigation. The Parties shall share the mediator’s fees and expenses equally, and each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs.

14.4 **Litigation; Venue.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days after the appointment of a mediator (or such longer period as the Parties may agree in writing), either Party may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction. Each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in **Delaware**, and waives any objection based on improper venue or forum non conveniens.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek interim or injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or enjoin a breach of its intellectual property or confidentiality rights without first complying with the negotiation or mediation procedures in this Article XIV.
