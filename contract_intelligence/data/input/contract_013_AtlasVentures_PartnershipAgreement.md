  (c) development, configuration, and deployment of analytic dashboards and reporting tools to support Contoso’s decision-making, including customization of data visualization solutions;

  (d) ongoing managed services, including support, monitoring, and maintenance of certain technology solutions designated in an SOW, and provision of technical support to Contoso’s designated personnel;

  (e) project management and change management services, including the planning, coordination, and oversight of tasks and resources necessary to deliver the Services and Deliverables, management of dependencies, risks, and issues, and regular status reporting;

  (f) training and knowledge transfer for Contoso’s personnel as required for Contoso to effectively use and administer the Deliverables and any implemented solutions.

2.2 **Statements of Work.**  

(a) The specific scope, objectives, Deliverables, timelines, and resource commitments for each project will be defined in one or more SOWs executed by the Parties. Each SOW shall reference this Agreement and will form an integral part hereof.

(b) In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any SOW, the terms of the SOW shall govern with respect to the subject matter thereof, but solely to the extent of the conflict, unless the SOW expressly states otherwise.

2.3 **Deliverables and Milestones.**  

(a) Each SOW shall specify the Deliverables to be provided by Atlas, including specifications, acceptance criteria, and delivery dates or milestone schedules, as applicable.

(b) Milestones may include, by way of example and without limitation: completion of discovery and requirements gathering, delivery of solution design documentation, completion of initial configuration and integration, user acceptance testing (“UAT”), go‑live, and completion of post‑implementation stabilization.

(c) Atlas shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the milestones and delivery dates set forth in each SOW. The Parties acknowledge, however, that timelines may be impacted by factors beyond Atlas’s reasonable control, including but not limited to dependencies on Contoso’s timely provision of information, access, and approvals, availability of third-party systems, and changes requested by Contoso in accordance with Article XIII.

(d) Where a milestone date is expressly designated in an SOW as “critical” or “time‑is‑of‑the‑essence,” Atlas shall prioritize achieving such milestone date; however, Atlas shall not be liable for delay to the extent such delay is caused by Contoso, a Force Majeure Event, or other circumstances outside of Atlas’s reasonable control, provided Atlas uses commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such delay.

2.4 **Performance Standards.**  

(a) Atlas shall perform the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner, in accordance with generally accepted industry standards for providers of similar services, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

(b) Atlas shall assign suitably qualified and experienced personnel to perform the Services and shall be solely responsible for the supervision, direction, and compensation of its personnel. Atlas may use subcontractors to perform portions of the Services, provided that Atlas remains fully responsible and liable for the performance of such subcontractors.

(c) Contoso shall designate one or more project managers or primary contacts to coordinate with Atlas and shall ensure that such personnel have the necessary authority to make decisions and provide approvals on behalf of Contoso within the scope of the engagement.

(d) Where Service Levels are specified in Article XII or an SOW, Atlas shall perform the Services in a manner designed to meet or exceed the Service Levels. Any credits or other remedies for failure to achieve the Service Levels shall be as expressly set forth in Article XII and/or the applicable SOW, and shall be Contoso’s exclusive remedy for such failures, except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.

2.5 **Contoso Responsibilities.**  

The Parties acknowledge that Atlas’s ability to perform the Services and meet the agreed timelines is dependent upon Contoso’s timely performance of certain responsibilities, including but not limited to:

  (b) ensuring the accuracy and completeness of all information and materials provided to Atlas;

  (c) making timely decisions and providing approvals and feedback as reasonably requested by Atlas;

  (d) ensuring that any third-party suppliers or platforms controlled by Contoso cooperate as necessary to allow Atlas to perform the Services.

If Contoso fails to perform its responsibilities in a timely manner, Atlas shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the applicable schedule, milestones, and Fees, as reasonably necessary to account for the delay, and Atlas shall not be deemed in breach of this Agreement due solely to such delay.

2.6 **Acceptance of Deliverables.**  

(a) Each SOW shall specify the acceptance process for the Deliverables. Unless otherwise stated in the SOW, Contoso shall have fifteen (15) Business Days (the “Review Period”) after delivery of a Deliverable to review and either (i) provide written acceptance, or (ii) provide a written rejection specifying in reasonable detail the respects in which the Deliverable fails to conform to the Specifications.

(b) If Contoso rejects a Deliverable in accordance with this Section 2.6, Atlas shall, at no additional charge, use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the nonconformities and re‑deliver the Deliverable within a reasonable period. Contoso shall then have a further Review Period to re-evaluate the Deliverable.

(c) Deliverables shall be deemed accepted upon the earlier of: (i) Contoso’s written acceptance; or (ii) expiration of the Review Period (or any re‑Review Period) without Contoso having provided a written rejection specifying material nonconformities.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any use of a Deliverable in a live production environment by Contoso (other than for testing purposes) shall constitute acceptance of such Deliverable.

## ARTICLE VIII – INDEMNIFICATION

8.1 **Indemnification by Atlas.**  

Atlas shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Contoso, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, “Contoso Indemnitees”) from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) (collectively, “Losses”) arising out of or relating to any third‑party claim, demand, suit, or proceeding (“Claim”) alleging that the Work Product (excluding Contoso Data and materials provided by Contoso) infringes any U.S. patent, copyright, or trade secret of such third party.  

Atlas shall have no obligation under this Section 8.1 to the extent the Claim arises from: (a) use of the Work Product in combination with any other products, services, or materials not provided or authorized by Atlas, where the infringement would not have occurred but for such combination; (b) modification of the Work Product by any person other than Atlas or its authorized contractors; (c) Contoso’s failure to use an updated version or modification provided by Atlas to avoid infringement; or (d) compliance with specifications or instructions provided by Contoso.

8.2 **Indemnification by Contoso.**  

Given the high‑risk nature of this engagement, Contoso shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Atlas, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, “Atlas Indemnitees”) from and against any and all Losses arising out of or relating to any third‑party Claim:

  (a) alleging that any data, materials, or instructions provided by or on behalf of Contoso (including Contoso Data) infringe or misappropriate any Intellectual Property Rights or violate any privacy or other rights of a third party;

8.4 **Infringement Mitigation.**

IN VIEW OF THE HIGH‑RISK NATURE OF THIS ENGAGEMENT, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THERE SHALL BE **NO CONTRACTUAL CAP ON EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY** UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

9.2 **Inclusion of Consequential Damages.**  

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES, AND GIVEN THE HIGH‑RISK PROFILE OF THIS ENGAGEMENT, EACH PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR LOSS OF DATA) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL **NOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED**, SUBJECT ONLY TO APPLICABLE LAW. THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS DEVIATION FROM TYPICAL LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISIONS HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY NEGOTIATED.

9.3 **Proportionate Responsibility.**  

Notwithstanding Sections 9.1 and 9.2, each Party’s liability shall be limited to the extent of its proportionate share of fault in causing the relevant Losses, as determined in accordance with applicable law.

Any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement must be brought within two (2) years after the cause of action accrues, except for claims related to unpaid Fees, breach of confidentiality, or violation of Intellectual Property Rights, which shall be subject only to the applicable statute of limitations.
