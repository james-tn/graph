## ARTICLE III – FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Fees.** In consideration for the Services and Deliverables, the Client shall pay the Service Provider fees up to the Contract Value. The details of the fees shall be set out in applicable SOWs and may include, by way of example:

3.1.1 **Management Fees.** A monthly management fee for each Employee assigned to the Client, covering HR administration, payroll processing, and employer-of-record services;

3.1.2 **Placement/Recruitment Fees.** One-time or amortised recruitment fees for sourcing and hiring each Employee, calculated as a percentage of annualised gross remuneration or as a fixed amount per placement, as specified in the SOW;

3.1.3 **Project Fees.** Where applicable, fixed or time-and-materials fees for specified HR projects, Deliverables, or consulting services, as set forth in the SOW.

3.2 **Contract Value and Adjustments.** The aggregate total of all fees payable for Services and Deliverables under this Agreement and all SOWs shall not exceed the Contract Value, unless the Parties agree otherwise in a written amendment or change order in accordance with Article XIII. For the avoidance of doubt, reimbursable Expenses and applicable taxes (if any) may be payable in addition to the Contract Value, as expressly stated in Section 3.4.

3.3 **Invoicing and Payment Terms.**

3.3.1 The Service Provider shall invoice the Client monthly in arrears for Services performed and Deliverables provided during the preceding month, unless the relevant SOW specifies different invoicing frequency or milestones.

3.3.2 Each invoice shall:  
(a) reference this Agreement and the relevant SOW;  
(b) itemise the Services, number of Employees, applicable fees, and Expenses (if any); and  
(c) be accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation for Expenses.

3.3.3 The Client shall pay all undisputed amounts within **thirty (30) calendar days** of the invoice date (**“Net 30”**). Payment shall be made by electronic bank transfer to the account designated in writing by the Service Provider, or as otherwise agreed in writing.

3.3.4 If the Client disputes any portion of an invoice, it shall notify the Service Provider in writing within fifteen (15) days of receipt, specifying the amount in dispute and the basis for the dispute. The Client shall pay the undisputed portion in accordance with this Section 3.3, and the Parties shall act in good faith to resolve the disputed portion promptly. Failure to provide timely notice of dispute shall be deemed acceptance of the invoice.

3.4 **Expenses and Reimbursement.** The Client shall reimburse the Service Provider for reasonable, properly incurred, and pre-approved Expenses directly related to the performance of the Services, including travel, accommodation, and subsistence expenses, in accordance with the Client’s travel and expense policy as provided to the Service Provider. Reimbursable Expenses shall be invoiced at cost and supported by appropriate receipts.

3.5 **Taxes.** Fees and Expenses are stated exclusive of value-added tax (VAT) or any similar sales tax, which shall be added to each invoice where applicable and payable by the Client. Each Party shall be responsible for its own income and corporate taxes in relation to this Agreement.

3.6 **Late Payment.**

3.6.1 Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies, any undisputed amount not paid by the Client when due shall accrue interest at a rate of two percent (2%) per annum above the Bank of England base rate, calculated daily from the due date until the date of actual payment, whether before or after judgment.

3.6.2 If any undisputed payment is more than sixty (60) days overdue, and after providing at least ten (10) Business Days’ prior written notice, the Service Provider may suspend the provision of Services (including deployment of Employees) until all overdue amounts and accrued interest are paid in full. Suspension of Services shall not relieve the Client of its obligation to pay any amounts due.

3.7 **Set-off.** The Client may not set off, withhold, or deduct any amounts owed by the Service Provider (whether disputed or undisputed) from invoiced amounts, except to the extent required by law or expressly agreed in writing. This Section is client-favourable only insofar as disputes are promptly handled; however, the Client retains the right to withhold payment of genuinely disputed amounts.
