Contoso hereby engages Delta, and Delta hereby accepts such engagement, to perform the Services and provide the Deliverables described herein and in each applicable SOW, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that, although this Agreement may contemplate the deployment of personnel performing functions similar to employees, the relationship between Contoso and Delta shall be that of an independent contractor, as set forth in **Section 16.8**, and nothing herein shall be construed to create an employment relationship between Contoso and any personnel provided by Delta.

2.2 **General Description of Services.**  
Delta shall provide to Contoso a combination of professional, technical, and staffing services, which may include, without limitation:

  2.2.1 Software design, development, testing, quality assurance, maintenance, and support services for Contoso’s internal and external applications and platforms;

  (g) any additional terms specific to the SOW.

No SOW shall be binding unless duly executed by authorized representatives of both Parties and shall expressly reference this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any SOW, the terms of this Agreement shall control, unless the SOW expressly states that a particular provision is intended to supersede this Agreement and identifies such provision with specificity.

2.4 **Deliverables.**

  2.4.1 All Deliverables shall conform in all material respects to the applicable specifications, requirements, and acceptance criteria described in the relevant SOW.

  2.6.3 Time is of the essence with respect to critical milestones explicitly identified as such in the applicable SOW.

Delta shall, at no additional cost to Contoso, promptly correct such non-conformity and resubmit the Deliverable, after which a new Acceptance Period shall commence.

  2.8.3 Deliverables shall be deemed accepted if (a) Contoso provides written notice of acceptance, or (b) Contoso fails to provide a written rejection notice within the Acceptance Period, provided that such “deemed acceptance” shall not apply in cases of latent defects not reasonably discoverable during the Acceptance Period.

2.9 **Subcontractors.**  
Delta may use subcontractors or other third parties to perform portions of the Services, provided that:

  2.9.1 Delta remains fully responsible for the acts, omissions, and performance of its subcontractors as if they were Delta’s own employees;

  2.9.2 Any subcontractor to whom Confidential Information or Personal Data is disclosed shall be bound by written obligations of confidentiality and data protection substantially similar to those set forth in **Articles V and XI**; and

## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with the performance of this Agreement.

  11.2.4 Not engage sub-processors to process Personal Data without Contoso’s prior written consent, and shall impose on such sub-processors data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this **Article XI**.
