9.2 **Consequential and Other Damages.**  
Given the High Risk designation agreed by the Parties, the Parties acknowledge and agree that **CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES MAY BE RECOVERABLE** to the extent such damages are reasonably foreseeable and proven in accordance with applicable law, and are not otherwise expressly excluded in this Agreement.

12.1 **Scope of SLA.**  
This Article XII sets forth the Service Levels applicable to the managed services described in Section 2.5. The SLA shall apply from the commencement of Phase 5 (Managed Services) until the Expiration Date, unless modified by a Change Order.

12.2 **Uptime Commitment.**  
Nova shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the production environment of the in-scope systems is Available (as defined below) not less than **99.9%** of each calendar month (“Uptime Commitment”). “Available” means that the in-scope systems are operational and accessible to end-users, excluding Permitted Downtime.

12.3 **Permitted Downtime.**  
“Permitted Downtime” means:  
(a) scheduled maintenance windows agreed in advance with Contoso (with at least five (5) Business Days’ notice where practicable);  
(b) emergency maintenance to address critical vulnerabilities or issues, provided Nova uses reasonable efforts to minimize disruption; and  
(c) downtime attributable to Force Majeure Events, Contoso’s acts or omissions, or failures of third-party services outside of Nova’s reasonable control.

12.4 **Incident Response and Resolution Times.**  
Nova shall respond to and work to resolve incidents according to the following priority levels:

- **Priority 1 (Critical):** Complete production outage or severe degradation impacting a material portion of users, with no reasonable workaround.  
  - Initial response time: 1 hour (24x7).  
  - Target resolution or workaround time: 4 hours.

- **Priority 2 (High):** Significant functionality impaired, affecting multiple users, with a workaround available but causing material operational impact.  
  - Initial response time: 2 hours (business hours); 4 hours (off-hours).  
  - Target resolution or workaround time: 8 business hours.

- **Priority 3 (Medium):** Moderate functionality issue or defect with limited business impact or a readily available workaround.  
  - Initial response time: 1 business day.  
  - Target resolution or workaround time: 5 business days.

  - Initial response time: 2 business days.  
  - Target resolution or workaround time: as agreed, typically in a future release.

12.5 **SLA Credits.**  
If Nova fails to meet the Uptime Commitment for any calendar month, Contoso shall be entitled to service credits as follows, calculated as a percentage of the monthly Managed Services Fee for the affected month:

- Uptime between 99.0% and 99.9%: 5% credit  
- Uptime between 98.0% and 99.0%: 10% credit  
- Uptime below 98.0%: 20% credit  

SLA credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall constitute Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the Uptime Commitment, except where such failure results from Nova’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

12.6 **Exclusions from SLA.**  
The SLA shall not apply to:  
(a) beta, pilot, or non-production systems unless expressly included in writing;  
(b) incidents caused by Contoso’s misuse of the systems or failure to follow Nova’s documented instructions; or  
(c) downtime related to Force Majeure Events or Permitted Downtime.

14.4 **Litigation; Venue; Governing Law.**  
If the dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days after the appointment of a mediator, either Party may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in **New Castle County, Delaware** for any such action, and waive any objection based on forum non conveniens or lack of personal jurisdiction.
