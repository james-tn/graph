  8.1.1 Allegations that the Deliverables, Summit Tech Background IP as used by Contoso in accordance with this Agreement, or the Services (excluding Third-Party Materials and Contoso-provided materials) infringe or misappropriate any Intellectual Property Rights of a third party in the Territory;

  8.1.2 Summit Tech’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement; or

  8.1.3 Summit Tech’s breach of its data protection and privacy obligations under Article XI or applicable data protection Laws.

8.2 **Indemnification by Contoso.**  

Contoso shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Summit Tech and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, **“Summit Indemnitees”**) from and against any and all Claims arising out of or relating to:

  8.2.1 Contoso’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement;

  8.2.2 Contoso’s breach of applicable Laws in connection with its use of the Products, Services, or Deliverables; or

  8.2.3 Allegations that any materials, data, or content provided by Contoso to Summit Tech infringe or misappropriate any third party’s Intellectual Property Rights.

8.3 **Indemnification Procedures.**  

  8.3.1 The Party seeking indemnification (the **“Indemnified Party”**) shall promptly notify the other Party (the **“Indemnifying Party”**) in writing of any Claim for which it seeks indemnification, provided that any delay or failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent it is materially prejudiced thereby.

  8.3.2 The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of the Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, provided that: (a) the Indemnified Party may participate in the defense with its own counsel at its own expense; and (b) the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim that imposes any liability, admission of guilt, or non-monetary obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

  8.3.3 The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defense and settlement of any Claim.

8.4 **Infringement Remedies.**  

If any Deliverable, Product, or Service is, or in Summit Tech’s reasonable opinion is likely to be, the subject of an infringement Claim, Summit Tech shall, at its option and expense, either: (a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using the allegedly infringing item; (b) replace or modify the item so that it becomes non-infringing while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected SOW or functionality and refund to Contoso the fees paid for the affected item, less a reasonable allocation for any period of beneficial use. This Section 8.4, together with Section 8.1.1, sets forth Summit Tech’s sole and exclusive liability, and Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy, with respect to any infringement Claim, subject to the overall limitations in Article IX.

## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, BUSINESS, OR DATA (IN EACH CASE, WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT), ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE).

9.2 **Aggregate Liability Cap.**  

EXCEPT FOR (A) A PARTY’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE VIII (SOLELY WITH RESPECT TO THIRD-PARTY IP INFRINGEMENT, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR DATA BREACHES); (B) A PARTY’S BREACH OF ITS CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE V; OR (C) A PARTY’S INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF THE OTHER PARTY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO **TWO (2) TIMES** THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CONToso TO SUMMIT TECH UNDER THE APPLICABLE SOW DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

For clarity, where the claim does not relate to a specific SOW, the relevant fees shall be determined by reference to the fees paid or payable under this Agreement during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

9.3 **Exceptions.**  

The limitations in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 shall not apply to: (a) a Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; (b) a Party’s payment obligations under Article III; or (c) any amounts finally awarded pursuant to Section 14.3.

9.4 **Low-Risk Orientation.**  

The Parties acknowledge that the limitation of liability provisions in this Article IX are intended to provide Contoso with a relatively favorable risk allocation consistent with a low-risk profile, by capping liability at two (2) times the applicable fees and excluding certain categories of damages, while preserving liability for key obligations such as confidentiality, data protection, and specific indemnities.

Summit Tech shall provide Contoso with at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice of any cancellation, non-renewal, or material reduction in such coverage.

10.3 **No Limitation.**  

The insurance requirements set forth in this Article X shall not limit Summit Tech’s liability or obligations under this Agreement, but shall be considered a minimum level of protection for Contoso.

## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  

Each Party shall comply with all applicable data protection and privacy Laws in connection with its performance under this Agreement, including the CCPA, GDPR (to the extent applicable), and any other similar Laws in jurisdictions where Personal Data is processed.

11.2 **Role of the Parties.**  

For purposes of applicable data protection Laws, Contoso shall generally be deemed the “business” or “controller” and Summit Tech the “service provider” or “processor” with respect to any Personal Data that Summit Tech processes on behalf of Contoso in the course of providing the Services. Summit Tech shall process such Personal Data solely on Contoso’s documented instructions as set forth in this Agreement and any SOW, except where otherwise required by applicable Law.

11.3 **Processing Obligations of Summit Tech.**  

Summit Tech shall:

  11.3.1 Process Personal Data only for the purpose of providing the Services and as otherwise instructed by Contoso in writing, and not retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any other purpose, including any commercial purpose, except as permitted by Law;

  11.3.2 Implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, taking into account the nature of the Personal Data and the risks involved;

  11.4.2 Summit Tech remains fully responsible for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors; and  

  11.4.3 Summit Tech maintains an up-to-date list of subprocessors upon request by Contoso and provides Contoso with an opportunity to object on reasonable grounds to any new subprocessor that will have access to sensitive Personal Data. If Contoso reasonably objects, the Parties shall work in good faith to resolve the objection, and if they cannot, Contoso may terminate the affected Services without penalty.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  

In the event of a confirmed unauthorized access, acquisition, or disclosure of Personal Data processed by Summit Tech on behalf of Contoso that constitutes a breach under applicable data protection Laws (a **“Data Breach”**), Summit Tech shall:

  11.5.1 Notify Contoso in writing without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours of confirming the Data Breach;

12.4 **Chronic SLA Failures.**  

If Summit Tech fails to meet the Availability Service Levels in any three (3) calendar months in any rolling six (6)-month period, or repeatedly fails to meet critical response or resolution times, Contoso may treat such failures as a material breach and may terminate the affected Services or SOW upon thirty (30) days’ written notice, without penalty and in addition to any earned service credits.

13.3 **Approval Process.**  

No Change Request shall be binding unless and until it is approved in writing by authorized representatives of both Parties.

13.4 **Effect on Performance.**  

Pending the Parties’ written agreement to a Change Request, Summit Tech shall continue to perform the Services in accordance with the existing SOW and Project Plan. Summit Tech shall not implement any change that materially affects the scope, timeline, or fees without a mutually executed Change Request.
