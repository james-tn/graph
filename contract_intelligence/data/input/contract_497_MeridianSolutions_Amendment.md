2.2.2 **Solution Design and Architecture.** Based on the approved Requirements Specification, Vendor shall design a high-level and detailed solution architecture describing data flows, integration points, system components, security considerations, and scalability requirements. Such architecture shall be recorded in a **Solution Design Document**, which shall be submitted to Client for review and approval. Vendor shall not materially deviate from the approved Solution Design Document without Client’s prior written consent, except as required by Applicable Law or security considerations, and upon timely notice to Client.

The Parties shall agree upon specific timelines, milestones, and delivery dates in each SOW. Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet all agreed milestones. If Vendor becomes aware of circumstances that may cause a material delay, Vendor shall notify Client in writing promptly, describing the nature of the delay, the expected impact, and proposed mitigation measures.

Vendor may engage subcontractors to perform portions of the Services, provided that (a) Vendor remains fully responsible and liable for all acts and omissions of its subcontractors; (b) any subcontractor with access to Client’s Confidential Information or Personal Data is bound by written obligations of confidentiality and data protection comparable to those set forth in this Amendment; and (c) upon Client’s reasonable request, Vendor will provide information concerning subcontractors performing material portions of the Services.

2.8 **Compliance with Client Policies.**  
To the extent Vendor’s personnel perform Services on Client’s premises or access Client’s internal systems, Vendor shall ensure such personnel comply with Client’s reasonable workplace, security, and conduct policies, as provided in writing in advance.

8.5 **Exclusive Remedy.**  
Subject to **Article IX**, this **Article VIII** sets forth the indemnified Party’s exclusive remedy and the indemnifying Party’s entire liability for any third-party claims of Intellectual Property infringement.

## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with the collection, use, storage, processing, and transfer of Personal Data. To the extent Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of Client, Vendor shall be deemed a “processor” or “service provider” under Data Protection Laws, and Client shall be deemed the “controller” or “business.”

11.2 **Data Processing.**  
Vendor shall process Personal Data only: (a) on documented instructions from Client; (b) as necessary to perform the Services; or (c) as required by Applicable Law, in which case Vendor shall, to the extent legally permitted, notify Client prior to processing.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, damage, alteration, or disclosure, consistent with industry standards and Data Protection Laws. Such measures shall include, as appropriate: encryption in transit and at rest, access controls, authentication, logging, monitoring, and regular security testing.

11.4 **Subprocessors.**  
Vendor may engage subprocessors to assist in processing Personal Data, provided that: (a) Vendor enters into a written agreement with each subprocessor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Article XI; (b) Vendor remains fully liable for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors; and (c) Vendor maintains an up-to-date list of subprocessors and, upon Client’s request, provides Client with information regarding such subprocessors.

In the event Vendor becomes aware of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personal Data processed on behalf of Client (a **“Data Breach”**), Vendor shall: (a) promptly, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours, notify Client in writing, describing the nature of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records concerned, and any steps Vendor has taken or proposes to take; (b) cooperate with Client and provide reasonable assistance in investigating and mitigating the Data Breach; and (c) promptly take all necessary steps to remedy the Data Breach and prevent recurrence. Vendor shall not notify any third party, including any data subject or regulator, of the Data Breach without Client’s prior written consent, unless required by Applicable Law.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.**  
Vendor shall, to the extent legally permitted, promptly notify Client if Vendor receives a request from a data subject relating to Personal Data processed on behalf of Client (e.g., access, correction, deletion, or portability requests).

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, to perform the Services, or as required by Applicable Law.

Any retained Personal Data shall remain subject to the obligations set forth in this Article XI.

11.8 **Data Transfers.**  
If any Personal Data is transferred across national borders, Vendor shall ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with Data Protection Laws, including, where applicable, the use of standard contractual clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms approved by relevant authorities.

11.9 **Audit Rights.**  
Upon reasonable prior notice, and not more than once annually (unless required by a Data Protection Authority or in response to a Data Breach), Client or its designated third-party auditor (subject to confidentiality obligations) may audit Vendor’s data protection practices and facilities to verify compliance with this Article XI. Vendor shall cooperate in good faith with such audit, provided it does not unreasonably interfere with Vendor’s business operations.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  
Vendor may schedule routine maintenance windows, provided that Vendor: (a) provides at least forty-eight (48) hours’ advance notice to Client; (b) uses commercially reasonable efforts to schedule maintenance during off-peak hours; and (c) limits the duration of any maintenance window to what is reasonably necessary. Scheduled maintenance shall not count as downtime for uptime calculations.

12.4 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.**  
If Vendor fails to meet the uptime or response time commitments in this Article XII in any calendar month, Client may be entitled to service credits as specified in the applicable SOW or SLA schedule.

The Parties shall discuss the Change Request in good faith.

13.3 **Approval Procedure.**

The Parties shall share equally the mediator’s fees and costs; each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs.

14.4 **Arbitration or Litigation.**

The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information or Intellectual Property.

14.5 **Governing Law and Venue.**  
This Amendment and any Dispute arising out of or relating hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **State of California**, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
