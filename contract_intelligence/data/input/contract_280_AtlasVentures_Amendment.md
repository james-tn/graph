  2.1.2 Implementation, configuration, and customization of Atlas’s proprietary software components and frameworks for integration into Contoso’s environments;

2.2 **Statements of Work.** Each SOW shall, at a minimum, specify: (a) a detailed description of the Services and Deliverables; (b) the applicable milestones and timelines; (c) the fees, expenses, and payment schedule; (d) Service Levels and acceptance criteria, where applicable; and (e) any project-specific assumptions, dependencies, and client responsibilities. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any SOW, the terms of this Agreement shall control unless the SOW expressly states that it is intended to supersede a specific provision of this Agreement, in which case the SOW shall control solely with respect to that provision and solely for the scope of such SOW.

2.3 **Performance Standards.** Atlas shall perform the Services: (a) in a professional and workmanlike manner; (b) in accordance with generally accepted industry standards for similar services; and (c) in material compliance with this Agreement and the applicable SOW. Atlas shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the milestones and delivery dates specified in each SOW; provided, however, that any delays attributable to Contoso or its Affiliates, or to any third parties contracted directly by Contoso, shall result in equitable adjustments to the timelines as reasonably determined by Atlas and approved through the change management process described in Article XIII.

2.4 **Project Governance.** The Parties shall establish a project governance structure appropriate for the size and complexity of each SOW, which shall include:

  2.4.1 Designation by each Party of a project manager with authority to act on behalf of such Party regarding day-to-day project decisions (each, a “Project Manager”);

  2.4.2 Regular status meetings (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) to review project progress, issues, risks, and change requests;

  2.4.3 Escalation procedures for resolving project-level disputes or delays, which shall dovetail with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Article XIV.

2.5 **Client Responsibilities.** Contoso acknowledges that its timely cooperation is essential to Atlas’s ability to perform the Services. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Contoso shall:

  2.5.1 Provide Atlas with timely access to relevant personnel, facilities, systems, data, and documentation as reasonably required for the Services;

  2.5.2 Obtain all necessary internal approvals and provide decisions or approvals requested by Atlas in a timely manner;

  2.5.3 Ensure that any data or content provided to Atlas is accurate, complete, and does not infringe the rights of any third party or violate applicable law;

  2.5.4 Be responsible for any third-party licenses, hardware, or infrastructure that Contoso is required to provide under the applicable SOW.

Contoso’s failure to perform any of the foregoing obligations may result in delays, additional costs, and adjustments to the scope and timelines, for which Atlas shall not be liable. Atlas shall notify Contoso promptly in writing of any such failures and the anticipated impact.

2.6 **Deliverables and Acceptance.** Each SOW shall specify deliverables and acceptance criteria. Unless otherwise stated in the SOW:

  2.6.1 Upon delivery of a Deliverable, Atlas shall notify Contoso in writing (including electronically), and Contoso shall have a review and acceptance period of ten (10) Business Days, or such other period as specified in the SOW;

  2.6.2 If Contoso identifies material defects or non-conformities with the applicable acceptance criteria during the review period, Contoso shall provide Atlas with a written description of such issues in reasonable detail;

  2.6.4 The Deliverable shall be deemed accepted upon the earliest of: (a) written acceptance by Contoso; (b) expiration of the review period without written rejection; or (c) use of the Deliverable by Contoso in a production or commercial environment.

2.7 **Subcontractors.** Atlas may engage Subcontractors to perform portions of the Services, provided that Atlas remains responsible for the performance of such Subcontractors and their compliance with this Agreement. Upon Contoso’s written request, Atlas shall provide a list of material Subcontractors engaged in providing the Services. Atlas shall ensure that any Subcontractor who receives access to Contoso’s Confidential Information or Personal Data is bound by written obligations of confidentiality and data protection no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement.

2.8 **High-Risk Nature of Engagement.** The Parties acknowledge that certain Services under this Agreement may involve complex integrations, high-volume data processing, or critical business systems, and that such Services may carry heightened operational and legal risks. Contoso expressly assumes responsibility for: (a) validating the suitability of the Services and Deliverables for its specific business purposes; (b) implementing appropriate backup, redundancy, and disaster recovery measures; and (c) maintaining its own internal risk management protocols. The risk allocation provisions in Articles VIII, IX, and XI reflect this High-Risk designation and have been factored into the Contract Value.

9.1 **No Cap; High-Risk Engagement.** IN VIEW OF THE HIGH-RISK NATURE OF THE ENGAGEMENT AND THE PARTIES’ NEGOTIATED ALLOCATION OF RISK, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT **THERE SHALL BE NO CONTRACTUAL CAP ON EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY** UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS PROVISION HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY NEGOTIATED AND REFLECTS THE CONTRACT VALUE, SLA COMMITMENTS, AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.

9.2 **Types of Damages.** SUBJECT TO SECTION 9.3, EACH PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ALL DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES, OR THE DELIVERABLES.

9.3 **Exclusions.** Notwithstanding Section 9.2, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any damages arising solely from the other Party’s failure to implement reasonable data backup, redundancy, or disaster recovery plans, or the other Party’s failure to comply with its own internal security and compliance policies, except to the extent the damages result from a breach by the first Party of its obligations under this Agreement.

9.4 **Mitigation.** Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any damages it suffers in connection with this Agreement.

9.5 **Allocation of Risk.** The Parties agree that the fees charged by Atlas reflect the allocation of risk set forth in this Article IX, and that the absence of a liability cap and the inclusion of consequential and similar damages is an integral part of the High-Risk engagement agreed upon by the Parties.

## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its collection, use, processing, storage, and disclosure of Personal Data under this Agreement. To the extent Atlas processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso, the Parties shall enter into a separate data processing addendum (“DPA”) incorporating GDPR/CCPA-required terms, which shall be deemed incorporated into and made part of this Agreement.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.** For purposes of Data Protection Laws:

  11.2.1 Contoso is the “controller” (or “business” under CCPA) with respect to Personal Data it provides to Atlas;  

  11.2.2 Atlas is the “processor” (or “service provider” under CCPA) with respect to such Personal Data.

11.3 **Processing Instructions.** Atlas shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, as set forth in this Agreement, the applicable SOWs, and any DPA, except where otherwise required by law.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute through negotiation and escalation as follows:

  14.1.1 The Parties’ Project Managers shall confer and attempt to resolve the dispute;  

  14.1.2 If the Project Managers are unable to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) Business Days, the dispute shall be escalated to senior executives of the Parties for an additional fifteen (15) Business Days;  

  14.1.3 If the dispute is not resolved through such negotiations within the foregoing periods, either Party may pursue mediation or other remedies as provided in this Article XIV.

14.2 **Mediation.** Prior to initiating arbitration or litigation (except to seek injunctive relief), the Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute through non-binding mediation administered by a mutually agreed mediator or mediation service located in Dallas County, Texas. The Parties shall share equally the mediator’s fees and mediation costs, and each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and expenses. Mediation shall be completed within sixty (60) days after the mediator is appointed, unless the Parties agree otherwise.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.** If the dispute is not resolved through mediation, either Party may elect to submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, or, at Atlas’s sole discretion, to litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction. If arbitration is elected:

  14.3.1 The arbitration shall be conducted by a panel of three (3) arbitrators with experience in commercial technology disputes;  

  14.3.2 The seat of arbitration shall be Dallas, Texas;  

  14.3.3 The language of arbitration shall be English;  

  14.3.4 The arbitrators shall have authority to award any monetary or equitable relief permitted under this Agreement and applicable law.

If litigation is pursued instead of arbitration, the Parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Dallas County, Texas, as further described in Section 16.5.

14.4 **Interim Relief.** Nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking provisional or interim injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or curtail actual or threatened breaches of confidentiality, data protection, or intellectual property obligations, pending final resolution of the dispute through arbitration or litigation.

15.2 **Effect of Force Majeure.** If a Party is prevented from performing its obligations under this Agreement due to a Force Majeure Event, such obligations shall be suspended for the duration of the Force Majeure Event, and the affected Party shall not be liable for any resulting delays or failures to perform, provided that:

  15.2.1 The affected Party promptly notifies the other Party in writing of the Force Majeure Event and its expected duration;
