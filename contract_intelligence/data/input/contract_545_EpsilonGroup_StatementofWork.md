9.2 **Cap Determination for this SOW.**

For purposes of Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement, the **“total Fees paid or payable by Contoso to Epsilon under this Agreement in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim”** shall be calculated by reference to the aggregate Fees paid or payable under the Parent Agreement, including this SOW and any other SOWs. The Parties acknowledge that, in a dispute that relates solely to this SOW, the Fees associated with this SOW during such twelve-month period will be the primary basis for determining the cap, but total Agreement-level Fees may be considered where required by the Parent Agreement.
