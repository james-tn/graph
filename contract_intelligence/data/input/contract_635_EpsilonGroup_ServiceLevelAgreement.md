Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve **System Availability** of at least **99.9%** in each calendar month. System Availability shall be calculated as:

12.4 **Maintenance Windows.**  
Vendor may schedule maintenance windows for upgrades or other maintenance activities that may impact System Availability. Vendor shall provide at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior notice for planned maintenance expected to cause downtime and shall, where feasible, schedule such maintenance during off-peak hours.

12.5 **Service Credits.**  
If Vendor fails to achieve the required 99.9% System Availability in a given calendar month, Client may be eligible for service credits as follows:

- Availability between 99.0% and 99.9%: 2% of the monthly recurring Service fees  
- Availability between 98.0% and 99.0%: 5% of the monthly recurring Service fees  
- Availability below 98.0%: 10% of the monthly recurring Service fees  

To receive a service credit, Client must submit a written request within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the failure occurred. Service credits shall be applied to future invoices and shall be Client’s sole monetary remedy for Service Level failures, without limiting Client’s rights under **Article IV** to terminate for material and repeated failures.

12.6 **Disaster Recovery.**  
Vendor shall maintain disaster recovery procedures designed to restore the Services following a catastrophic failure. Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve a Recovery Time Objective (“**RTO**”) of twenty-four (24) hours and a Recovery Point Objective (“**RPO**”) of four (4) hours.
