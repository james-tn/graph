### 13.3 Service Credits

13.3.1 The service credit framework described in **Section 12.4 (Service Credits)** of the Parent Agreement shall apply to failures to meet the Uptime Commitment for the Additional Software Modules.

13.3.2 The Client must request service credits in writing within thirty (30) days after the month in which the failure occurred, as provided in Section 12.4.2. Service credits remain the Client’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for SLA shortfalls, without prejudice to other contractual remedies for material breaches of the Agreement.
