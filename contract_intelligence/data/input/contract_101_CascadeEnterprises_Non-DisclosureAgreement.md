In the event of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personal Data or Client Data (a **“Data Breach”**), Vendor shall:

**11.6 Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Vendor shall retain Personal Data and Client Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law.

Any retained data shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations herein.

### SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

**12.1 Uptime Commitment.**  
For any hosted or cloud‑based Services provided by Vendor, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Services are available at least **99.9% of the time** in each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance, emergency maintenance, and downtime caused by circumstances beyond Vendor’s reasonable control.

**12.2 Scheduled Maintenance.**  
Vendor may perform scheduled maintenance during designated maintenance windows, which shall be communicated to Client at least forty‑eight (48) hours in advance whenever reasonably practicable. Scheduled maintenance shall not unreasonably interfere with Client’s normal business operations.

**12.3 Incident Response Times.**  
Vendor shall respond to incident reports in accordance with the following target response times, measured from Client’s notification to Vendor’s support channel:

  - **Critical (Severity 1):** System outage or severe impact on core business operations – target initial response within **1 hour**;  
  - **High (Severity 2):** Significant degradation with limited workaround – target initial response within **4 hours**;  
  - **Medium (Severity 3):** Minor degradation or functional issue – target initial response within **1 Business Day**;  
  - **Low (Severity 4):** Cosmetic or general inquiry – target initial response within **2 Business Days**.

Resolution times shall vary depending on the complexity and nature of the issue; Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve incidents promptly.

**12.4 SLA Remedies.**  
As Client’s **sole and exclusive remedy** for Vendor’s failure to meet the uptime commitment in Section 12.1, Vendor shall provide service credits as specified in the applicable SOW (if any). Service credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall not be redeemable for cash. Repeated or material SLA failures may constitute a material breach, subject to Article IV, but shall not give rise to additional remedies other than those expressly provided herein.
