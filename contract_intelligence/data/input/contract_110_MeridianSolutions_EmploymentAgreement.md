For purposes of Personal Data processed in connection with this Agreement:

  (a) Contoso shall generally act as a “controller” (or equivalent term under applicable law) with respect to Contoso Data, including Personal Data of its employees, candidates, and contractors; and  
  (b) Meridian shall act as a “processor” (or “service provider” under the CCPA) processing Personal Data on behalf of Contoso solely for the permitted purposes of this Agreement.

11.3 **Processing Instructions.**  
Meridian shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, including as set forth in this Agreement and any SOW, unless required to do so by applicable law, in which case Meridian shall inform Contoso (to the extent legally permitted) before such processing.

14.2 **Escalation.**  
If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days of written notice of the Dispute, either Party may escalate the matter to senior executives (e.g., Vice President level or above) for further discussion.

14.3 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation and escalation, the Parties agree to attempt to resolve it through non‑binding mediation administered by a mutually agreed mediator in Delaware.

Each Party shall bear its own costs, and the Parties shall share equally the mediator’s fees.

14.4 **Litigation / Venue.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved by mediation, either Party may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties agree that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware, and each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect Confidential Information, Intellectual Property, or Personal Data, without first submitting to mediation.
