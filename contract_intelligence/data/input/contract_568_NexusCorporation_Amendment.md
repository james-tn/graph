The Parties acknowledge and agree that:

(a) This Amendment involves high availability, advanced analytics, and critical transactional capabilities, which justify the allocation of risk contemplated herein;  
(b) The Additional Contract Value and the risk allocation in this Article IX were a material inducement for the Parties to enter into this Amendment; and  
(c) All other limitations and exclusions in Article IX of the Parent Agreement remain in effect for matters not arising under this Amendment.

### 12.4 SLA Credits
