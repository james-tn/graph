  (a) design, configuration, and implementation of cloud-based infrastructure and related software components;

  (b) integration of Contoso’s existing business applications, databases, and interfaces with Vendor’s preferred platforms and tools;

  (c) deployment and configuration of monitoring, logging, and alerting solutions for production environments;

  (d) ongoing managed services, including incident response, problem management, performance tuning, capacity management, backup monitoring, and patch/upgrade coordination;

  (e) advisory and consulting services relating to architecture, security, compliance, and operational efficiency; and

  (f) such other related services as may be agreed in one or more Statements of Work.

2.2 **Statements of Work.**  

2.2.1 Each SOW executed by the Parties and referencing this Addendum shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Addendum and the terms of any SOW, the terms of this Addendum shall prevail unless the SOW expressly states that it is intended to supersede a specific provision of this Addendum, in which case that SOW provision shall prevail solely for the purposes of the relevant SOW.

2.2.2 Each SOW shall, at a minimum, specify: (i) the detailed description of Services and Deliverables; (ii) applicable milestones and timelines; (iii) Fees and payment schedule; (iv) any specific acceptance criteria for Deliverables; and (v) any additional service levels or performance obligations, if different from or supplemental to those set forth herein.

2.3 **Detailed Description of Services.**  

Without limiting the generality of Section 2.1, the Services shall include the following categories of work:

  (a) **Discovery and Requirements Analysis.** Cascade shall conduct discovery workshops, review existing documentation, and interview key stakeholders identified by Contoso to gather business, functional, technical, and security requirements. Cascade shall produce a Requirements Specification Document summarizing such requirements, dependencies, and assumptions, which shall be provided to Contoso for review and comment. Contoso shall be responsible for confirming the completeness and accuracy of such requirements within a commercially reasonable period, and failure to respond within ten (10) Business Days shall be deemed acceptance.

  (b) **Solution Design and Architecture.** Based on the agreed requirements, Cascade shall propose a high-level and then detailed solution architecture, including system topology, integration points, data flows, security controls, and capacity assumptions. Cascade shall utilise its commercially reasonable judgement and standard methodologies. Contoso acknowledges that architecture choices may be influenced by Vendor’s preferred technologies, third-party components, and cost considerations. Any changes requested by Contoso after initial design approval may require a Change Order pursuant to Article XIII.

  (c) **Implementation and Configuration.** Cascade shall implement and configure the agreed solution, including but not limited to provisioning cloud infrastructure, deploying application components, configuring network and access controls, and establishing data integration processes. Cascade shall use commercially reasonable efforts to adhere to the timelines agreed in the applicable SOW, subject to Contoso’s timely provision of information, resources, access and approvals. Delays attributable to Contoso or third parties outside Cascade’s control shall entitle Cascade to schedule extensions and, where applicable, additional Fees pursuant to Section 13.4.

  (d) **Testing and Acceptance.** Cascade shall conduct internal testing (including unit, integration, and system testing) in accordance with its standard testing methodologies. Upon completion of internal testing, Cascade shall notify Contoso that the relevant Deliverables or milestones are ready for User Acceptance Testing (“UAT”). Contoso shall complete UAT within the timeframe specified in the relevant SOW, and shall provide written notice of acceptance or rejection identifying specific non-conformities with the acceptance criteria. If Contoso fails to provide such notice within the specified timeframe, the Deliverables shall be deemed accepted. Cascade shall remedy verified non-conformities in a commercially reasonable timeframe at no additional charge, provided such non-conformities are not caused by Contoso’s systems, data, or misuse.

  (e) **Transition to Managed Services.** Following acceptance of the initial implementation, the Parties may agree that Cascade shall provide ongoing managed services. Such services may include, without limitation, monitoring, incident management, application maintenance, performance optimisation, periodic reporting, and participation in governance meetings. The specific scope, KPIs, and reporting obligations shall be set forth in the relevant SOW. Contoso acknowledges that certain operational decisions may be made by Cascade in its reasonable discretion to maintain system stability and security.

  (f) **Support and Maintenance.** Cascade shall provide technical support to Contoso’s designated contacts in accordance with the Service Levels specified in Article XII. Maintenance services may include the application of patches, version upgrades, and configuration changes, subject to Contoso’s approval where material downtime or impact is anticipated. Emergency changes may be implemented without prior approval if required to address critical security or stability issues, provided Cascade notifies Contoso promptly thereafter.

2.4 **Deliverables.**  

2.4.1 Key Deliverables may include, without limitation:

  (a) Requirements Specification Document;  
  (b) Solution Architecture and Design Documentation;  
  (c) Configuration and Integration Documentation;  
  (d) Operational Runbooks and Support Procedures;  
  (e) Periodic Performance and Incident Reports; and  
  (f) Any other deliverables specified in the applicable SOW.

2.4.2 Unless otherwise specified in a SOW, all Deliverables shall be provided in English in electronic format (PDF, Word, or other mutually agreed format). Printed copies shall be provided only upon request and may be subject to additional Fees.

2.5 **Performance Standards.**  

2.5.1 Cascade shall perform the Services with reasonable skill and care, in a professional and workmanlike manner, and in accordance with generally accepted industry standards for services of a similar nature, as further elaborated in Article VII.

2.5.2 Contoso acknowledges that successful performance of the Services is dependent upon the timely cooperation of Contoso, including the provision of accurate information, necessary access to systems and personnel, and prompt decision-making. Cascade shall not be liable for any failure to meet timelines or Service Levels to the extent such failure is caused by Contoso or by third parties under Contoso’s control.

2.6 **Changes to Scope.**  

Any changes to the Services, Deliverables, or related assumptions shall be managed in accordance with Article XIII (Change Management). No verbal commitments or informal instructions shall be binding unless documented in a written Change Order signed by authorised representatives of both Parties.

8.3.1 The Party seeking indemnification (the **“Indemnified Party”**) shall: (a) promptly notify the other Party (the **“Indemnifying Party”**) in writing of any Third-Party Claim for which indemnification is sought, provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent prejudiced thereby; (b) allow the Indemnifying Party sole control of the defence and settlement of the Third-Party Claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party may not settle any claim that imposes any admission of liability, non-monetary obligations, or injunctive relief on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent; and (c) provide reasonable cooperation, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defence and settlement of the Third-Party Claim.

8.3.2 The Indemnified Party may participate in the defence of any Third-Party Claim with its own counsel at its own expense, provided that such participation shall not interfere with the Indemnifying Party’s control of the defence.

8.4 **IP Infringement Remedies.**  

If any Service or Deliverable is, or in Cascade’s reasonable opinion is likely to be, the subject of an infringement claim, Cascade may, at its option and expense: (a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using the affected Service or Deliverable; (b) replace or modify the Service or Deliverable so that it becomes non-infringing, provided such replacement or modification does not materially reduce overall functionality; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected Service or Deliverable and refund to Contoso any prepaid Fees for the unused portion of the Term for such Service or Deliverable, as applicable. This Section 8.4 sets forth Contoso’s exclusive remedy for any alleged infringement by the Services or Deliverables.

9.3 **Exceptions.**  

Nothing in this Addendum shall exclude or limit either Party’s liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by its negligence; (b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; (c) any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law; or (d) obligations to pay Fees and expenses due under Article III.

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.**  

For the purposes of applicable Data Protection Laws, the Parties acknowledge that, in respect of Personal Data processed by Cascade in connection with the Services, Contoso shall generally act as controller (or equivalent), and Cascade shall act as processor (or equivalent), except where Cascade determines the purposes and means of processing in which case it may act as an independent controller for such processing.

11.2 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  

Each Party shall comply with its respective obligations under Data Protection Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, Contoso shall ensure that it has a valid legal basis for instructing Cascade to process Personal Data, and that all necessary notices have been provided and consents obtained (where required) from data subjects.

11.3 **Data Processing Instructions.**  

11.3.1 Cascade shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a third country, unless required to do so by applicable law. In such case, Cascade shall inform Contoso of that legal requirement before processing, unless prohibited by law.

11.3.2 Details of the processing (such as subject matter, duration, nature, and purposes of processing, and categories of data subjects and Personal Data) may be specified in a data processing schedule or in the relevant SOW.

11.4 **Security Measures.**  

Cascade shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, as appropriate, measures relating to pseudonymisation, encryption, access controls, regular testing of security, and incident response.

11.5 **Sub-processors.**  

11.5.1 Contoso grants Cascade general authorisation to engage sub-processors to assist with the provision of the Services. Cascade shall ensure that any sub-processor is bound by written terms that are no less protective of Personal Data than those set forth in this Article XI.

11.5.2 Cascade shall remain liable to Contoso for the acts and omissions of its sub-processors to the same extent Cascade would be liable if performing the services of each sub-processor directly.

11.6 **Data Breach Notification.**  

In the event of a personal data breach (as defined in Data Protection Laws) affecting Personal Data processed by Cascade in connection with this Addendum, Cascade shall, without undue delay, notify Contoso and provide information reasonably required by Contoso to meet its obligations under Data Protection Laws. Cascade shall take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of and rectify such breach.

11.7 **Data Subject Rights.**  

Taking into account the nature of the processing, Cascade shall assist Contoso, by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is reasonably possible, in fulfilling Contoso’s obligations to respond to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  

Upon termination or expiration of this Addendum, Cascade shall, at Contoso’s option, delete or return all Personal Data processed on behalf of Contoso, and delete existing copies unless applicable law requires storage of the Personal Data. Cascade may retain copies of Personal Data to the extent necessary for archiving, audit, or defence of legal claims, in which case such Personal Data shall remain subject to the confidentiality and security obligations of this Addendum.

11.9 **International Transfers.**  

To the extent Personal Data is transferred outside the UK or European Economic Area to a country that does not provide an adequate level of protection, the Parties shall ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place (such as standard contractual clauses, international data transfer agreements, or other valid transfer mechanisms under Data Protection Laws).

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Availability Commitment.**  

Cascade shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the production Services under its control (excluding scheduled maintenance, emergency maintenance, and any downtime attributable to Contoso or third parties) are available at least **99.9%** of the time measured on a monthly basis.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  

Cascade may perform scheduled maintenance during agreed maintenance windows. Cascade shall provide reasonable prior notice (at least forty-eight (48) hours where practicable) of any scheduled maintenance expected to cause Service unavailability beyond routine minor disruptions.

12.3 **Incident Response and Resolution.**  

12.3.1 Contoso shall report incidents in accordance with the support procedures defined in the applicable SOW. Cascade shall respond to incidents based on their severity level as follows (illustrative, subject to SOW):

  - **Severity 1 (Critical):** Target initial response within 1 hour; target workaround or resolution within 4 hours.  
  - **Severity 2 (High):** Target initial response within 4 hours; target resolution within 1 Business Day.  
  - **Severity 3 (Medium):** Target initial response within 1 Business Day; target resolution within 3 Business Days.  
  - **Severity 4 (Low):** Target initial response within 2 Business Days; resolution as mutually agreed or in next planned release.

12.3.2 The Parties acknowledge that response and resolution times are targets only; failure to meet such targets shall not be deemed a breach if Cascade uses commercially reasonable efforts.

12.4 **SLA Credits.**  

12.4.1 If Cascade fails to meet the availability commitment in Section 12.1 in any calendar month, Contoso may be entitled to SLA Credits as specified in the applicable SOW. Unless otherwise stated, SLA Credits (if any) shall be calculated as a percentage of the monthly recurring Fees for the affected Services.

12.4.2 SLA Credits shall be Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the Service Levels, without prejudice to Contoso’s other rights in the event of persistent or material failures that constitute a breach of this Addendum.

---

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  

Either Party may propose changes to the scope, Deliverables, timelines, or other aspects of the Services (each a **“Change Request”**). Change Requests shall be submitted in writing and shall describe the proposed change, the rationale, and any anticipated impact on cost, schedule, or resources.

13.2 **Change Orders.**  

If the Parties agree to proceed with a Change Request, they shall document the agreed change in a written Change Order signed by authorised representatives of both Parties. Each Change Order shall specify: (a) the nature of the change; (b) any adjustments to Fees, timelines, or resources; and (c) any other modifications to the SOW or Addendum.

13.3 **Effect of Change Orders.**  

No Change Request shall be effective until executed as a Change Order. Upon execution, the Change Order shall form part of, and be subject to, this Addendum. Cascade shall not be obligated to commence work on the changed scope until the Change Order is fully executed.

13.4 **Impact on Fees and Timelines.**  

If Contoso requests changes or additional work not included in the original scope, Cascade shall be entitled to adjust the Fees and timelines accordingly. Such adjustments shall be set out in the applicable Change Order. Delays caused by Contoso’s failure to approve a Change Order in a timely manner shall entitle Cascade to corresponding extensions.

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  

In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with this Addendum, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the matter through negotiation. The dispute shall be escalated to senior business representatives of each Party, who shall meet (in person or by teleconference) within ten (10) Business Days of written notice of the dispute and seek to resolve it within twenty (20) Business Days thereafter.

14.2 **Mediation.**  

If the dispute is not resolved through negotiation within the time period specified in Section 14.1, the Parties shall consider in good faith submitting the dispute to non-binding mediation in London, United Kingdom, under the auspices of the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) or another mutually agreed mediation body. The costs of mediation shall be shared equally, except that each Party shall bear its own legal and other representation costs.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  

If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after the commencement of mediation (or such longer period as the Parties may agree), either Party may refer the dispute to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales as set forth in Section 16.3. Nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking interim or injunctive relief in any competent court at any time.

---

## ARTICLE XV – FORCE MAJEURE

15.1 **Definition of Force Majeure.**  

A **“Force Majeure Event”** means any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of a Party, including, without limitation, acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, civil unrest, strikes or other industrial disputes (excluding strikes involving the affected Party’s own workforce), power outages, failures of telecommunications or internet services not under the affected Party’s control, epidemics, pandemics, governmental actions, or changes in law.

15.2 **Effect of Force Majeure.**  

If a Party is prevented from or delayed in performing any of its obligations under this Addendum by a Force Majeure Event, such Party shall be excused from performance during the period and to the extent affected by the Force Majeure Event, provided that the Party: (a) promptly notifies the other Party of the Force Majeure Event and its expected duration; and (b) uses commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event and resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable.

15.3 **Extended Force Majeure.**  

If a Force Majeure Event affecting a Party continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and materially affects the performance of key obligations, either Party may terminate the affected Services or SOW upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, without liability (other than payment obligations accrued prior to termination).
