However, given the **medium risk classification** of the Additional Services under this Addendum, the Parties expressly agree that, **solely with respect to claims arising out of or relating to this Addendum and the Additional Services**, Article IX of the Parent Agreement is superseded and replaced by the provisions of this Article IX.

9.2 **Liability Cap.** Except as provided in **Section 9.4 (Exceptions)**, each Party’s aggregate liability to the other Party arising out of or relating to this Addendum, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall not exceed an amount equal to **the total fees paid or payable by Contoso to Atlas under this Addendum during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.

9.3 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.** EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 9.4 BELOW, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY.

9.4 **Exceptions.** The limitations in **Sections 9.2 and 9.3** shall not apply to:

  (a) A Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII of this Addendum**, to the extent such obligations arise from third-party IP infringement claims or gross negligence/willful misconduct;

  (b) A Party’s breach of **Article V (Confidentiality)** as it relates to intentional misuse or disclosure of Confidential Information under this Addendum;

  (c) A Party’s fraud or willful misconduct; or

  (d) Contoso’s payment obligations for fees due under this Addendum.

For any claims falling within these exceptions, the limitations of Article IX of the Parent Agreement may apply, subject to Applicable Law; provided that nothing herein shall revive the no-cap regime for all claims under this Addendum where the Parties have expressly introduced a cap.

9.5 **Mitigation.** Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any damages it incurs in connection with this Addendum, consistent with **Section 9.4 of the Parent Agreement**.

11.1 **Applicability of Parent Agreement Article XI.** The data protection and privacy provisions in **Article XI of the Parent Agreement** (Sections 11.1–11.9) are incorporated herein by reference and shall govern all Processing of Personal Data in connection with the Additional Services. The following provisions clarify certain aspects relating to the Additional Processing Activities.

11.4 **Behavioral and Enrichment Data.** Prior to Processing behavioral and enrichment data, Atlas shall cooperate with Contoso to ensure compliance with CCPA, GDPR, and analogous laws, including honoring Data Subject rights related to profiling and opt-out of certain Processing where applicable. Atlas shall not **“sell”** or **“share”** Personal Data for cross-context behavioral advertising as those terms are defined under CCPA, except as explicitly permitted by Contoso and Applicable Law, consistent with **Section 11.3(c) of the Parent Agreement**.

11.5 **Security Measures.** The technical and organizational measures in **Section 11.4 of the Parent Agreement** apply to the Additional Services. Given the nature of the Additional Processing Activities, Atlas shall ensure that:

11.6 **Sub-processors for Additional Services.** If Atlas engages new Sub-processors specifically for the Additional Services, Atlas shall provide Contoso with notice and an opportunity to object consistent with **Section 11.5 of the Parent Agreement**. If Contoso objects, the Parties shall seek an alternative solution; failing which, Contoso may terminate the affected portion of the Additional Services in accordance with **Section 11.5(c)**.

11.7 **Data Breach Notification.** Any Security Incident involving Personal Data processed under this Addendum shall be handled in accordance with **Section 11.6 of the Parent Agreement**, including notification to Contoso within seventy-two (72) hours after Atlas becomes aware of the incident, to the extent required by Applicable Law.

11.8 **Cross-Border Transfers.** If the Additional Services require cross-border data transfers beyond those contemplated at the time of execution of the Parent Agreement, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards as required by **Section 11.8 of the Parent Agreement**, including Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent mechanisms.

11.9 **Data Protection Assessments and Audits.** Contoso may request information and conduct audits relating specifically to the Additional Processing Activities, subject to **Section 11.9 of the Parent Agreement**, including limitations to preserve Atlas’s security and the confidentiality of other customers’ data.
