## ARTICLE XVI – GENERAL PROVISIONS

16.1 **Entire Agreement and Relationship to Parent Agreement.** This Amendment, together with the Parent Agreement and all annexes and Change Orders thereto, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Amendment and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous understandings relating solely to such subject matter. For clarity, this Amendment **supplements and modifies** the Parent Agreement but does not supersede it in its entirety.

16.2 **Amendments.** In accordance with **Section 16.2 of the Parent Agreement**, no amendment or modification of this Amendment shall be effective unless in writing, signed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties, and expressly referencing both the Parent Agreement (Ref: **LSE-MER-202404-445 / contract_445**) and this Amendment (Ref: **AMD-MER-202404-580**).

16.3 **Severability.** If any provision of this Amendment is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect, and the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision that, to the greatest extent possible, achieves the original intent.

16.4 **Waiver.** No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power, or remedy under this Amendment shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise preclude any other or further exercise. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving Party.

16.5 **Assignment.** The assignment provisions in **Section 16.5 of the Parent Agreement** shall apply to this Amendment. Any assignment of rights or obligations under this Amendment shall be effective only if the underlying assignment of the Parent Agreement is valid and effective.

Any notice relating specifically to this Amendment shall reference Contract Reference Number **AMD-MER-202404-580** and, where relevant, the Parent Agreement reference number **LSE-MER-202404-445**.

16.8 **Governing Law.** Consistent with **Section 16.8 of the Parent Agreement**, this Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of **Singapore**, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

16.9 **Survival.** The provisions of this Amendment which by their nature are intended to survive termination or expiration, including without limitation Articles III (with respect to accrued payment obligations), V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, XI, XIV, and XVI, shall survive any termination or expiration of this Amendment, in addition to the survival provisions in **Section 16.9 of the Parent Agreement**.

16.10 **Counterparts; Electronic Signatures.** This Amendment may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
