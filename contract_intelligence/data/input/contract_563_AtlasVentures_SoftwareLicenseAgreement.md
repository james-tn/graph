9.1 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

9.2 **Cap on Liability.**  
EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE EXCLUDED CLAIMS DESCRIBED IN **SECTION 9.3**, AND SUBJECT TO THE CLIENT-FRIENDLY NATURE OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED **THREE (3) TIMES** THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CLIENT TO ATLAS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY.

9.3 **Exceptions to Limitations.**  
The limitations in **Sections 9.1 and 9.2** shall not apply to: (a) a Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII**; (b) a Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under **Article V**; (c) Client’s payment obligations under **Article III**; (d) a Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (e) Client’s violation of the License restrictions in **Section 6.6**. For the avoidance of doubt, Atlas’s liability for data breaches caused by its failure to comply with **Article XI** shall remain subject to the cap in **Section 9.2**, unless such failure constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.**  
The Parties agree that the limitations and exclusions of liability set forth in this **Article IX** were negotiated and are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between the Parties, and that in the absence of such limitations, the economic terms of this Agreement would be substantially different.

## ARTICLE XI  
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws, including, as applicable, the **General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”)**, the **California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)**, and any similar federal, state, or international data protection laws. To the extent Atlas processes Personal Data on behalf of Client in providing the Services, the Parties shall enter into a separate data processing addendum (“DPA”) that shall form part of this Agreement and set forth the roles and responsibilities of the Parties regarding such processing.

11.2 **Data Processing and Role of the Parties.**  
For purposes of applicable data protection laws, Client shall be deemed the “controller” (or equivalent term) of Client Data, and Atlas shall be deemed the “processor” (or equivalent term) in relation to Personal Data contained in Client Data. Atlas shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Client, as set forth in this Agreement and any DPA, and shall not sell Client’s Personal Data or use it for any purpose other than providing the Software and Services.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
Atlas shall implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Client Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures shall include, at a minimum: (a) access controls; (b) encryption of data in transit and at rest where commercially reasonable; (c) regular security testing; (d) employee security awareness training; and (e) incident response procedures.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personal Data for which Atlas is responsible (“Data Breach”), Atlas shall: (a) notify Client without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach; (b) provide Client with information reasonably necessary to understand the nature and scope of the Data Breach and to meet any notification obligations to regulators or affected individuals; and (c) take commercially reasonable steps to contain, mitigate, and remediate the Data Breach. Atlas shall cooperate with Client, at Client’s reasonable request and expense (except where the Data Breach is caused by Atlas’s breach, in which case such cooperation shall be at Atlas’s expense), in any investigation, regulatory notification, or other response efforts.

11.5 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Atlas shall retain Client Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services or as otherwise required by law. Upon Client’s written request or upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, Atlas shall delete or return Client Data in its possession or control, except that Atlas may retain copies of Client Data solely as required by law or for backup, archival, or audit purposes, subject to the confidentiality obligations in **Article V**. Any retained Client Data shall remain subject to the protections of this Agreement for as long as it is retained.

11.6 **Subprocessors.**  
Client authorizes Atlas to engage third-party subprocessors to process Personal Data in connection with providing the Services, provided that Atlas shall: (a) impose on such subprocessors data protection obligations that are at least as protective as those set forth in this Agreement; and (b) remain responsible for the acts and omissions of such subprocessors to the same extent as if performed by Atlas.

11.7 **Data Subject Rights and Requests.**  
Atlas shall, to the extent legally permitted and technically feasible, assist Client in responding to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under applicable data protection laws (such as rights of access, correction, deletion, or portability) with respect to Personal Data in the possession or control of Atlas. Client shall be responsible for determining whether and how to respond to such requests and for handling any direct communications with data subjects.

12.3 **Support Response Times.**  
Atlas shall provide technical support during business hours (8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. U.S. Central Time, Monday through Friday, excluding U.S. federal holidays). Atlas shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to support requests within the following target times:

- **Priority 4 (Low)** – General questions, enhancement requests, or cosmetic issues: initial response within 2 Business Days.

12.4 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.**  
If Atlas fails to meet the Uptime Commitment in a given calendar month, Client shall be eligible for a service credit as follows:

- Uptime between 99.0% and 99.9%: service credit equal to 5% of the monthly subscription Fees;  
- Uptime between 98.0% and 99.0%: service credit equal to 10% of the monthly subscription Fees;

To receive a service credit, Client must submit a written request to Atlas within thirty (30) days following the end of the month in which the Uptime Commitment was not met. The credits provided in this **Section 12.4** shall be Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for any failure to meet the Uptime Commitment, subject to Client’s rights under **Section 4.4** for persistent failures.

12.5 **Exclusions.**  
The SLA in this **Article XII** shall not apply to any performance issues caused by: (a) misuse or unauthorized modification of the Software by Client; (b) use of the Software in combination with systems or software not supported by Atlas; (c) denial-of-service attacks or other external network disruptions beyond Atlas’s reasonable control; or (d) Client’s failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

12.6 **Reporting.**  
Atlas shall maintain logs and records sufficient to measure and report on uptime and incident response times. Upon Client’s reasonable written request, Atlas shall provide periodic reports summarizing SLA performance.

12.7 **No Additional Warranties.**  
The SLA commitments in this **Article XII** are service level targets and do not create any additional warranties beyond those expressly set forth in **Article VII**.

14.3 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through escalation as described in **Section 14.2**, the Parties shall attempt to resolve the Dispute through non-binding mediation, to be conducted in **Dallas, Texas**, unless otherwise mutually agreed.

The mediation shall be conducted in accordance with the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) or another mutually agreed provider.

14.4 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  
If the Dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) days after the initiation of mediation (or such longer period as the Parties may agree in writing), either Party may pursue its rights and remedies in accordance with **Section 14.5**. Given the client-friendly nature of this Agreement, the Parties agree that either Party may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration or, at Client’s option, to litigation in the courts specified below.

14.5 **Venue and Governing Law.**  
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **State of Texas**, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

14.6 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information or Intellectual Property Rights, without first complying with the negotiation and mediation steps in **Sections 14.1–14.3**.

14.7 **Attorneys’ Fees.**
