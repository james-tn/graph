## ARTICLE VIII  
### INDEMNIFICATION

8.1 **Indemnification by Horizon.**  
Horizon shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Contoso and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, the “**Contoso Indemnified Parties**”) from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) (collectively, “**Claims**”) arising out of or relating to any third‑party claim that:  
  (a) the Deliverables (excluding Client Materials and Third‑Party Materials) infringe any U.S. Intellectual Property Rights of such third party; or  
  (b) Horizon’s gross negligence or willful misconduct caused bodily injury or death to any person or damage to tangible property.

8.2 **Indemnification by Contoso (Broad Client Obligation).**  
Contoso shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Horizon and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, the “**Horizon Indemnified Parties**”) from and against any and all Claims arising out of or relating to:  
  (a) Contoso’s use of the Deliverables or Services in violation of this Agreement or Applicable Law;  
  (b) any allegation that the Client Materials or other materials or instructions supplied by Contoso infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any third party’s Intellectual Property Rights or privacy rights;  
  (c) any breach by Contoso of its obligations under **Articles V (Confidentiality)** and **XI (Data Protection and Privacy)**;  
  (d) any bodily injury, death, or damage to tangible property to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of Contoso or its personnel.

8.3 **Indemnification Procedure.**  
As a condition to the indemnifying Party’s obligations:

  (a) The Party seeking indemnification (“**Indemnified Party**”) shall promptly notify the other Party (“**Indemnifying Party**”) in writing of any Claim for which it seeks indemnification; provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent it is materially prejudiced thereby;  
  (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any admission of liability, obligation, or non‑monetary relief on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);  
  (c) The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of the Claim at the Indemnifying Party’s expense and may participate in the defense at its own expense with counsel of its choosing.

8.4 **Infringement Mitigation.**  
If a Deliverable is, or in Horizon’s reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement Claim, Horizon may, at its option and expense:  
  (a) modify the Deliverable so that it becomes non‑infringing while preserving substantially equivalent functionality;  
  (b) replace the Deliverable with a non‑infringing alternative of substantially equivalent functionality; or  
  (c) obtain for Contoso a license to continue using the Deliverable.  
If Horizon determines that none of the foregoing options is commercially reasonable, Horizon may terminate the affected Deliverable and refund to Contoso any pre‑paid, unused Fees paid for such Deliverable.

8.5 **Exclusive Remedy.**  
Subject to **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)**, this Article VIII sets forth the Indemnified Party’s exclusive remedy for any third‑party Intellectual Property Rights infringement Claims.

Horizon shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the hosted components of the solution, if any, achieve **99.9% uptime** per calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance windows, emergency maintenance, and downtime attributable to Contoso, third‑party providers, or Force Majeure Events.

12.3 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  
Horizon may schedule routine maintenance windows during which the services may be unavailable, provided that Horizon:

  - **Priority 3 (Medium)** – Minor degradation or non‑critical issue: response within one (1) Business Day;  
  - **Priority 4 (Low)** – General inquiry or cosmetic issue: response within three (3) Business Days.

  (a) Contoso shall be eligible for service credits as set forth in the applicable SOW or, if not specified, a credit of up to five percent (5%) of the monthly support Fees for the affected services for that month;  
  (b) Service credits shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for SLA breaches, except in cases of material breach, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or persistent SLA failures over three or more consecutive months, in which case Contoso may pursue other remedies available under this Agreement.

12.6 **Exclusions.**  
SLA metrics shall not apply to, and Horizon shall have no liability for, any downtime or failures caused by:  
  (a) Contoso’s misuse or unauthorized modification of the solution;  
  (b) failure of third‑party networks or infrastructure outside Horizon’s reasonable control;

### DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.**

If the dispute remains unresolved after the escalation process, the Parties agree to attempt mediation in New York, New York, administered by a mutually agreed mediator or mediation provider.

The arbitration shall be conducted in New York, New York by a panel of one (1) or three (3) arbitrators, as agreed by the Parties. The arbitral award shall be final and binding and may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.  
  (b) **Litigation.** In the absence of such mutual agreement to arbitrate, either Party may bring an action in the state or federal courts located in New York County, New York, as further provided in **Section 16.4**.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction at any time, without first resorting to negotiation or mediation, where such relief is necessary to protect that Party’s Intellectual Property Rights, Confidential Information, or data privacy and security.
