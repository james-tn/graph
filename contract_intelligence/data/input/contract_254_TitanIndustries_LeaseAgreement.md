## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
To the extent either Party processes Personal Data in connection with this Agreement, each Party shall comply with all applicable data protection and privacy laws, including the PDPA, GDPR, CCPA, and any other similar laws applicable to the Parties’ activities.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  
The Parties acknowledge that, in general, each Party acts as a separate and independent data controller (or equivalent term under applicable law) with respect to Personal Data it collects and processes for its own purposes. Where Titan processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso solely for facility management or security (e.g., access control logs, CCTV monitoring), Titan shall act as a data processor (or equivalent term).

Where Titan acts as a processor for Contoso:  
(a) Titan shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso;  
(b) Titan shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage;  
(c) Titan shall ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data are subject to confidentiality obligations;  
(d) Titan shall assist Contoso in responding to data subject rights requests and regulatory inquiries, to the extent reasonably necessary and at Contoso’s cost; and  
(e) Titan shall not transfer Personal Data outside of the jurisdiction in which it is collected without implementing appropriate safeguards as required by law.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of any actual or suspected data breach involving Personal Data processed in connection with this Agreement, the Party discovering the breach shall promptly notify the other Party, without undue delay and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours, and shall provide reasonably available information regarding the nature, scope, and impact of the breach. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to investigate and remediate the breach and to comply with any legal or regulatory notifications.

11.5 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Each Party shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, and subject to **Section 5.5**, each Party shall delete or return any Personal Data of the other Party that it holds solely for purposes of this Agreement, unless retention is required by law or for legitimate business purposes (e.g., legal claims, regulatory obligations).

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Uptime Commitment.**  
Titan shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that critical building systems (including electricity supply to the Premises, HVAC, and elevator service) are available **99.9% of the time** on a monthly basis, excluding scheduled maintenance, emergency repairs, and Force Majeure Events.

12.2 **Response Times.**  
(a) **Emergency Issues** (e.g., fire, major water leak, complete power outage affecting the Premises): Titan shall respond within **1 hour** of notification and use continuous efforts to restore functionality.  
(b) **High-Priority Issues** (e.g., partial HVAC failure, security system issues): Titan shall respond within **4 hours** of notification and use diligent efforts to resolve within **24 hours**.  
(c) **Routine Issues** (e.g., minor repairs, non-critical maintenance requests): Titan shall respond within **2 Business Days** and use reasonable efforts to complete the work within **10 Business Days**, subject to availability of parts and contractors.

12.3 **Planned Maintenance.**  
Titan may schedule planned maintenance that may impact building systems, provided that it gives Contoso at least five (5) Business Days’ prior notice for non-emergency work and uses reasonable efforts to schedule such work during off-peak hours. Planned maintenance windows shall not count as downtime for purposes of the uptime calculation.

12.4 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.**  
If Titan fails to meet the uptime commitment in **Section 12.1** for two (2) consecutive months, Contoso shall be entitled, as its sole monetary remedy, to a service credit equal to **5% of the monthly Base Rent** for each such month, up to a maximum of **15% of the monthly Base Rent** over any rolling six (6)-month period. Service credits shall be applied against the next invoice(s) issued by Titan.

12.5 **Exclusions.**  
SLA commitments shall not apply to any outage or performance issue resulting from:  
(a) Contoso’s misuse of the Premises or building systems;  
(b) Contoso’s failure to provide access or cooperation;  
(c) Interruption of services caused by utility providers, telecommunications providers, or other third parties outside Titan’s reasonable control; or  
(d) Force Majeure Events.

Either Party may request changes to the Services, Premises configuration, or other aspects of this Agreement (each a **“Change Request”**). All Change Requests shall be made in writing and shall describe the proposed change, rationale, and desired timing.

13.2 **Evaluation of Changes.**  
Upon receiving a Change Request, Titan shall evaluate its technical and commercial feasibility, impact on timing, Service Levels, and cost, and shall, within a reasonable time, provide Contoso with a written response indicating:

(b) any required adjustments to Rent, Additional Rent, fees for Chargeable Services, or other financial terms; and

Once executed, such change order shall form part of this Agreement.

13.4 **Impact on Fees and Timeline.**  
Any approved change that results in additional work, increased operating costs, or reduced efficiency for Titan may result in corresponding increases in Rent, Additional Rent, or fees for Chargeable Services, as specified in the change order. Titan shall not be obligated to implement any Change Request that materially adversely affects the building’s integrity, safety, or regulatory compliance.

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (**“Dispute”**), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through negotiations between senior management representatives. Either Party may initiate this process by written notice to the other Party describing the Dispute.

14.2 **Mediation.**

The language of arbitration shall be English. The arbitral award shall be final and binding upon the Parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

15.4 **Prolonged Force Majeure.**
