8.3.2 granting the Indemnifying Party sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim (provided that the Indemnifying Party may not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any admission of liability or non-monetary obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed); and

8.3.3 providing reasonable cooperation and assistance, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defense and settlement of the Claim.

8.4 **IP Infringement Remedies.** In the event of a Claim alleging infringement of IPR by the Deliverables, Meridian may, at its sole option and expense: (i) procure for Contoso the right to continue using the affected Deliverables; (ii) modify the Deliverables so that they are non-infringing while preserving substantially equivalent functionality; or (iii) replace the Deliverables with substantially equivalent non-infringing deliverables. If none of the foregoing options are commercially reasonable in Meridian’s judgment, Meridian may terminate the affected Services and Deliverables upon written notice and refund to Contoso any prepaid, unused fees relating to the terminated Deliverables.

8.5 **Exclusions.** Meridian shall have no obligation under Section 8.1.1 to the extent any Claim results from: (i) modifications to the Deliverables by anyone other than Meridian, unless authorized or approved in writing by Meridian; (ii) combination of the Deliverables with products, services, or materials not provided or approved by Meridian, where the Claim would not have arisen but for such combination; (iii) use of the Deliverables in violation of this Amendment; or (iv) compliance by Meridian with Contoso’s written specifications or instructions.

## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.** For purposes of processing Personal Data under this Amendment, Contoso shall be deemed the **data controller** (or equivalent term under Applicable Data Protection Laws), and Meridian shall be deemed the **data processor** (or equivalent term) acting on behalf of Contoso.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.** Meridian shall process Personal Data solely on documented instructions from Contoso, as set forth in this Amendment, the Master Agreement, applicable Statements of Work, and any other written instructions provided by Contoso from time to time, except where processing is required by applicable law, in which case Meridian shall inform Contoso of such legal requirement prior to processing, unless prohibited by law.

11.3 **Security Measures.** Meridian shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, taking into account the nature of the Personal Data and the risks involved, in accordance with industry best practices and Applicable Data Protection Laws. Such measures shall include, where appropriate:

- access controls and authentication mechanisms;
- encryption of Personal Data in transit and at rest, where appropriate;
- network security controls and monitoring;
- secure development practices; and
- regular security assessments and vulnerability management.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Contoso hereby authorizes Meridian to engage Subprocessors to process Personal Data on Meridian’s behalf, provided that (i) Meridian enters into a written agreement with each Subprocessor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Article XI, and (ii) Meridian remains responsible for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors as if they were Meridian’s own acts and omissions.

11.5 **Data Subject Rights.** Taking into account the nature of the processing, Meridian shall assist Contoso, to the extent reasonably possible, in fulfilling Contoso’s obligations to respond to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection).

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Meridian shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services and as otherwise required by applicable law. Upon Contoso’s written request, or upon termination or expiration of this Amendment, Meridian shall, at Contoso’s election, delete or return Personal Data to Contoso and delete existing copies, except to the extent retention is required by law, in which case Meridian shall continue to protect such Personal Data in accordance with this Article XI.

12.5 **Reporting.** Meridian shall provide Contoso with periodic reports (e.g., monthly) summarizing Service Level performance, including uptime, incident metrics, and SLA Credits, if any.

However, Meridian is not obligated to proceed with any Change Request until a Change Order is executed.

13.5 **No Implied Changes.** No change to the Services, Deliverables, or obligations of either Party shall be inferred from course of dealing, custom, or practice; all changes shall be documented in a written Change Order executed by authorized representatives of both Parties.

The Parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in **New York County, New York**, for any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Amendment, and each Party irrevocably waives any objection to venue or forum based on inconvenient forum or other similar grounds.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or curtail any actual or threatened breach of its IPR or Confidential Information.

15.2.2 uses commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the Force Majeure Event and resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable.
