Except as expressly modified by this Amendment, the provisions of the Parent Agreement shall govern the Parties’ rights and obligations with respect to the subject matter hereof. For avoidance of doubt, Section 2.2 (Statements of Work), Section 2.3 (Deliverables and Milestones), and Section 2.4 (Performance Standards) of the Parent Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and shall apply to all Additional Equipment, Additional Services, and Deliverables ordered pursuant to this Amendment.

2.1.2 This Amendment is intended to function as a specific, binding modification of the quantities and pricing of Equipment and Services contemplated in the Relevant SOWs under the Parent Agreement and to establish additional scope parameters, timelines, and performance commitments for the Extended Deployment Phase.

### 2.2 Extended Deployment Phase – General Description

2.2.1 Under the Parent Agreement, Section 2.1.2 describes the initial scope as including, among other items: (a) design and supply of enterprise-grade network routers, switches, and secure gateway devices; (b) installation, configuration, and integration of such Equipment; (c) deployment of Zenith’s proprietary network management software; (d) data migration and cutover support; (e) ongoing maintenance, monitoring, and support; and (f) training of Contoso’s technical personnel.

  b. Provision of **Additional Services**, including:  
  - Detailed network design and capacity planning for the additional data centers and branch locations;  
  - Site readiness assessments and coordination with Contoso’s facilities teams;  
  - Installation, racking, stacking, cabling, and basic configuration of the Additional Equipment at each designated site;

### 2.3 Quantities and Phasing

2.3.1 The specific quantities of Additional Equipment to be procured under this Amendment, including model numbers, configurations, and per-site allocations, shall be set forth in one or more **Amendment SOWs** referencing this Amendment and the Parent Agreement. Each Amendment SOW shall identify:
