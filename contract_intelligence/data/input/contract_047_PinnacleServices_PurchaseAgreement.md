## ARTICLE IX. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR DATA, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

9.2 **Aggregate Liability Cap.** EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS (DEFINED BELOW), AND SUBJECT TO SECTION 9.3, THE TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO **FIVE (5) TIMES** THE FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CONTOSO TO PINNACLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE **TWELVE (12) MONTHS** PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

9.3 **Excluded Claims.** The limitations set forth in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 shall not apply to: (a) a Party’s indemnification obligations under Article VIII; (b) either Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; (c) Pinnacle’s breach of its obligations under Article V (Confidentiality) or Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy); or (d) Contoso’s payment obligations under Article III. For the avoidance of doubt, even for Excluded Claims, in no event shall either Party be liable for punitive damages to the extent such exclusion is permitted under Applicable Law.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.** The Parties agree that the limitations of liability set forth in this Article IX are an essential basis of the bargain between the Parties and that, absent such limitations, the economic terms of this Agreement would be substantially different.
