  b. The Service Provider shall not “sell” or “share” Personal Information, as those terms are defined in the CCPA; and  
  c. The Service Provider shall notify the Company if it can no longer meet its obligations as a service provider or contractor under the CCPA, and the Company may take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized use of Personal Information.

11.13 **Audit Rights.**
