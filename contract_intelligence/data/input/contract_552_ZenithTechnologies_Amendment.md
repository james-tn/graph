For clarity, Security Incidents resulting solely from Contoso’s misconfigurations, instructions, or failures to implement Zenith’s reasonable recommendations shall not, by themselves, constitute Zenith’s gross negligence.

8.2 **Indemnification by Contoso (Vendor‑Favorable Clarification).** The indemnity obligations of Contoso under **Section 8.2** of the Master Agreement are hereby expanded for the High‑Risk Program as follows:

  (a) Contoso shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Zenith Indemnified Parties from and against any Claims and Losses arising out of or relating to:  
  - Any allegation that Contoso’s data, configurations, or third‑party systems integrated at Contoso’s direction caused disruption or security vulnerabilities in the Critical Systems;  
  - Contoso’s failure to promptly implement critical patches, security recommendations, or configuration changes expressly identified and recommended in writing by Zenith, where such failure materially contributed to the Claim;  
  - Contoso’s breach of its data protection obligations, including failure to provide lawful instructions regarding Personal Data processing.

  (b) The procedures in **Section 8.3 (Indemnification Procedures)** of the Master Agreement shall apply to indemnification claims under this Amendment.

8.3 **Infringement Remedies.** The infringement remedies in **Section 8.4** of the Master Agreement continue to apply, including Zenith’s right to procure rights, modify/replace infringing items, or terminate the affected SOW with a refund of prepaid Fees for Services not yet performed.

8.4 **Exclusive Remedy.** Consistent with **Section 8.5** of the Master Agreement, this Article VIII states the indemnifying Party’s entire liability and the indemnified Party’s exclusive remedy for the third‑party Claims described herein, subject to **Article IX** of this Amendment.

## ARTICLE IX  
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Modification of Master Agreement Liability Provisions.** The Parties acknowledge that **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)** of the Master Agreement establishes a **five (5) times fees cap** and excludes certain types of damages. Given the High‑Risk nature of the Enhanced Services and Vendor‑favorable allocation of risk, the Parties hereby **modify and supersede Article IX of the Master Agreement solely with respect to this Amendment and the Enhanced Services** as follows.

9.2 **No Aggregate Monetary Cap (Enhanced Vendor Position).** For all Claims arising under or relating to this Amendment and the Enhanced Services, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, **there shall be no aggregate monetary cap** on the liability of either Party to the other. The fee‑based cap in **Section 9.2** of the Master Agreement shall not apply to Claims under this Amendment.

9.3 **Consequential and Special Damages.** The exclusion of consequential and special damages in **Section 9.1** of the Master Agreement shall **not apply** to Claims arising under this Amendment. Accordingly, subject to Applicable Law and except as limited below, either Party may seek recovery of indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages (including lost profits, revenue, or business opportunities) arising from the other Party’s breach of this Amendment or the Enhanced Services.

9.4 **Exceptions and Clarifications.** Notwithstanding the foregoing:

  (a) Nothing in this Amendment shall limit or exclude any liability to the extent such limitation or exclusion is prohibited by Applicable Law (e.g., liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation);  

  (b) The exclusions and exceptions relating to indemnification, confidentiality, gross negligence, willful misconduct, and data security breaches in **Section 9.3** of the Master Agreement are superseded by the terms of this Article IX for the Enhanced Services;  

  (c) The Parties acknowledge that the removal of liability caps and exclusion of consequential damages, together with the High‑Risk classification of this engagement, have been taken into account in determining the Amendment Contract Value of **US $1,387,060**.

9.5 **Risk Allocation Acknowledgment.** The Parties expressly acknowledge that the risk allocation under this Amendment is **significantly more favorable to Zenith** than that of the Master Agreement, in recognition of the High‑Risk Program, and that such allocation is a material condition of Zenith’s agreement to enter into this Amendment.

## ARTICLE X  
INSURANCE

10.1 **Insurance Coverage.** Zenith’s insurance obligations under **Article X** of the Master Agreement remain in full force and effect, including the required Commercial General Liability, Professional Liability / Errors & Omissions, Cyber Liability / Data Breach, and Workers’ Compensation coverage levels.

10.2 **Enhanced Insurance Confirmation.** For the High‑Risk Program, upon Contoso’s written request no more than once annually, Zenith shall provide updated certificates of insurance evidencing the continued maintenance of coverage in amounts no less than those specified in **Section 10.1** of the Master Agreement and confirming coverage for services of the nature contemplated in this Amendment.

10.3 **No Limitation.** Consistent with **Section 10.3** of the Master Agreement, Zenith’s maintenance of insurance shall not limit its obligations or liability under this Amendment (noting that this Amendment removes caps as described in **Article IX**).

11.3 **Security Incident Notification.** The Security Incident notification requirements in **Section 11.3** of the Master Agreement (including the 72‑hour notification window) are reaffirmed. For Critical Systems impacted by a Security Incident:

  (a) Zenith shall notify Contoso’s designated security contacts (to be specified in writing) **without undue delay** and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide initial notice within **twenty‑four (24) hours** of confirming the Security Incident;  

  (b) Zenith shall provide regular updates on investigation status and remediation steps, and shall cooperate with Contoso’s internal and external auditors or regulators as reasonably requested.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Zenith’s use of subprocessors under **Section 11.4** of the Master Agreement is permitted for the Enhanced Services, provided that any subprocessor with access to Personal Data or Critical Systems is disclosed to Contoso and subject to appropriate contractual safeguards.

11.5 **Data Retention and Deletion.** The retention and deletion obligations in **Section 11.5** of the Master Agreement shall apply to all Personal Data and Contoso data processed under this Amendment. Upon termination or expiration of this Amendment, Zenith shall, at Contoso’s option and subject to Applicable Law, return or securely delete such data, except as necessary for Transition Services or legal compliance.

Such service credits shall:

  (a) Be applied against future invoices for the Enhanced Services;  

  (b) Constitute Contoso’s exclusive **monetary** remedy for SLA failures, without limiting Contoso’s right to pursue other remedies such as termination for chronic SLA breaches as set forth below.

  (a) Contoso may escalate the issue through the PMO and require a remediation plan;
