2.1 **Engagement of Vendor.** Client hereby engages Vendor, and Vendor hereby accepts such engagement, to provide the Services and Deliverables as described in this Agreement and one or more SOWs executed by the Parties from time to time. Vendor shall perform the Services as an independent contractor and not as an employee, agent, joint venturer, or partner of Client, as further described in Section 16.8.

2.2 **General Description of Services.**  
Vendor shall provide strategic consulting and technology implementation services to support Client’s enterprise transformation initiatives, which may include, without limitation:

  (a) assessment of Client’s current technology architecture, business processes, and data landscape;

  (g) data migration, data quality analysis, and data governance consulting, including the design of data models and data retention policies; and  

  (h) ongoing advisory and optimization services related to Client’s use of implemented solutions, tools, and processes.

2.3 **Deliverables.**  
Without limiting the generality of Section 2.2, Vendor shall develop and deliver to Client the following types of Deliverables (as may be more specifically described in an SOW):

  (a) **Discovery and Assessment Reports** – including current-state assessments, gap analyses, and recommendations for process and technology enhancements;  

  (b) **Solution Design Documents** – including architecture diagrams, technical specifications, configuration guides, and integration designs;  

  (c) **Implementation Artifacts** – including configured system environments, custom code modules, interface scripts, and deployment documentation;

  (f) **Periodic Status and Performance Reports** – including project dashboards, milestone achievement reports, and performance metrics against the agreed Service Levels.

Each SOW shall specify the particular Deliverables to be produced, acceptance criteria, and any intermediate milestones applicable to such Deliverables.

2.4 **Project Phases and Timelines.**  
The Services may be structured into phases (for example, discovery, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and optimization). Each SOW shall set forth the start date and target completion date for each phase, key milestones, and any dependencies. Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the Services in accordance with such timelines; provided, however, that:

  (a) Vendor’s ability to meet timelines is contingent upon timely Client cooperation, including access to Client Materials, systems, and personnel;  

  (b) any delays caused by Client, its Affiliates, or third-party vendors shall entitle Vendor to reasonable schedule adjustments and, where applicable, additional Fees, to be documented through the change management process in Article XIII; and  

  (c) dates specified in any SOW shall be deemed estimates only unless expressly stated as binding "Firm Dates"; Firm Dates, if any, will be subject to appropriate relief in the event of delays caused by Client, third parties not under Vendor’s control, or Force Majeure Events.

2.5 **Performance Standards.**  
Vendor shall perform the Services:

  (a) in a diligent, professional, and workmanlike manner, in accordance with generally accepted industry standards for consulting and integration services of similar nature and complexity;  

  (b) in substantial conformity with the requirements and specifications set forth in this Agreement and the applicable SOW;  

  (c) in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as further described in Section 7.2; and  

  (d) using personnel who are appropriately skilled and experienced for the tasks to which they are assigned.

Client acknowledges that consulting services inherently involve professional judgment and that Vendor does not guarantee specific business results, revenue outcomes, or achievement of Client’s internal projections.

2.6 **Client Responsibilities.**  
Client’s timely and effective performance of its responsibilities is essential to Vendor’s ability to provide the Services and Deliverables. Without limiting Client’s obligations elsewhere in this Agreement, Client shall:

  (a) designate one or more project sponsors and a primary point-of-contact with appropriate decision-making authority;  

  (b) provide Vendor with timely access to Client’s facilities, systems, data, personnel, and third-party vendors as reasonably necessary for Vendor to perform the Services;  

  (c) provide accurate, complete, and timely information and Client Materials and promptly notify Vendor of any changes that may impact the Services;  

  (d) review and provide feedback on Deliverables within the timeframes specified in the applicable SOW, or, if not specified, within ten (10) Business Days of receipt; and  

  (e) obtain and maintain any third-party consents, licenses, or approvals necessary for Vendor to access or use Client’s systems, software, or data as contemplated by this Agreement.

Vendor shall be entitled to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information provided by Client and shall not be responsible for any delays, deficiencies, or failures in the Services or Deliverables to the extent caused by inaccurate or incomplete Client information, Client’s failure to perform its obligations, or third-party failures outside Vendor’s reasonable control.

2.7 **Acceptance of Deliverables.**  

  (a) Unless otherwise set forth in an SOW, within ten (10) Business Days after delivery of a Deliverable, Client shall: (i) provide written notice of acceptance; or (ii) provide a written statement specifying in reasonable detail any material nonconformities with the acceptance criteria set forth in the SOW (or, if none, the applicable requirements described in this Agreement).  

  (b) If Client fails to provide any such notice within the ten (10)-Business-Day period, the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted as of the end of that period.  

  (c) If Client timely identifies material nonconformities, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct such nonconformities and resubmit the Deliverable for Client’s review. The Parties shall follow the same acceptance procedure for re-submitted Deliverables.  

  (d) Acceptance of a Deliverable shall not constitute a waiver of Client’s rights with respect to latent defects that could not reasonably have been discovered through the acceptance testing process, subject to the warranty limitations in Article VII.

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its performance under this Agreement. To the extent Vendor Processes Personal Data on behalf of Client, Vendor shall be deemed a "processor" (or equivalent term) and Client shall be deemed a "controller" (or equivalent term), as such terms are defined in applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.**  
Vendor shall Process Personal Data only on Client’s documented instructions, as set forth in this Agreement, any applicable SOW, or as otherwise documented in writing, except where required by law, in which case Vendor shall, to the extent legally permitted, inform Client of such legal requirement before Processing.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, consistent with industry standards for similar services. Such measures shall include, as appropriate: access controls, encryption of data in transit and at rest (where feasible), network security, vulnerability management, logging, and incident response procedures.

11.4 **Subprocessors.**  
Vendor may engage Subcontractors to Process Personal Data on its behalf. Vendor shall ensure that any such Subcontractors are bound by written agreements requiring substantially similar data protection obligations as those set forth in this Article XI. Vendor shall remain liable for the acts and omissions of its Subcontractors to the same extent Vendor would be liable if performing the services directly.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed unauthorized access to, or acquisition, alteration, or destruction of, Personal Data under Vendor’s control that constitutes a "personal data breach" under applicable Data Protection Laws (a "**Data Breach**"), Vendor shall:

  (a) notify Client without undue delay and, where feasible, within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  

  (b) provide Client with information reasonably required for Client to meet its obligations under Data Protection Laws, including a description of the nature of the Data Breach, categories and approximate number of affected data subjects and records, likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to address the Data Breach; and

Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes of this Agreement or as required by applicable law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall, at Client’s option, delete or return all Personal Data in its possession or control, unless Vendor is required by law to retain such data, in which case Vendor shall continue to safeguard such data in accordance with this Article XI.

11.7 **Data Subject Requests.**  
Vendor shall, taking into account the nature of the Processing, reasonably assist Client, at Client’s expense, in responding to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (such as rights of access, rectification, erasure, and data portability), to the extent such requests relate to Personal Data Processed by Vendor on behalf of Client.

11.8 **Cross-Border Transfers.**  
To the extent Vendor transfers Personal Data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions with data transfer restrictions to a country that has not been determined to provide an adequate level of data protection, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses or other mechanisms recognized under Data Protection Laws, as mutually agreed.

To the extent Vendor provides ongoing support, monitoring, or managed services under this Agreement (e.g., operating or supporting implemented systems), the Service Levels set forth in this Article XII shall apply, as further detailed in any applicable SOW.

12.2 **Availability/Uptime.**  
Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any hosted or managed service environments under its control achieve an average monthly system availability of at least 99.9% ("**Availability Commitment**"), excluding periods of scheduled maintenance, emergency maintenance, and downtime caused by factors outside Vendor’s reasonable control (including Force Majeure Events, failures of third-party networks or services, and Client-side issues).

12.3 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  
Vendor may perform scheduled maintenance during designated maintenance windows, as specified in an applicable SOW or support documentation. Vendor shall use reasonable efforts to schedule maintenance during off-peak hours and provide Client with at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior notice for non-emergency maintenance that may materially impact service availability.

12.4 **Response and Resolution Times.**  
Vendor shall provide support and incident response in accordance with the following target times, measured from Vendor’s receipt of a support request through the agreed channels:

  - **Priority 1 (Critical)** – Major system outage or severe degradation with no reasonable workaround: initial response within 1 hour; target resolution or workaround within 8 hours.  
  - **Priority 2 (High)** – Significant functionality impaired but system is operational: initial response within 4 hours; target resolution within 2 Business Days.  
  - **Priority 3 (Medium)** – Limited impact on functionality; workaround available: initial response within 1 Business Day; target resolution within 5 Business Days.  
  - **Priority 4 (Low)** – Minor issue or general inquiry: initial response within 2 Business Days; resolution as mutually agreed.

The Parties may further refine these definitions in an SOW. Vendor does not guarantee resolution within the above timeframes but shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet them.

12.5 **Service Credits and Remedies.**  

  (a) If Vendor materially fails to meet the Availability Commitment for two (2) consecutive calendar months, Client shall be entitled, upon written request, to a service credit equal to five percent (5%) of the monthly Fees applicable to the affected managed services for each such month, up to a maximum of twenty percent (20%) of such monthly Fees.  

  (b) Service credits, if any, shall be Client’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for Vendor’s failure to meet the Service Levels, without prejudice to Client’s right to terminate for cause under Section 4.4 in the event of repeated or material failures.  

  (c) Service credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall not entitle Client to any refund unless no further invoices are due, in which case Vendor shall pay the credits to Client.

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  
Either Party may, from time to time, request changes to the scope, timing, or other aspects of the Services or Deliverables (each a "**Change Request**").

13.2 **Change Orders.**  
Upon receipt of a Change Request, Vendor shall assess its impact and provide Client with a written proposal outlining any changes to scope, Deliverables, assumptions, timelines, resource requirements, and Fees (a "**Change Order**").

13.3 **Approval and Implementation.**  
No Change Request shall be effective unless and until the Parties execute a mutually agreed Change Order. Once executed, the Change Order shall form part of this Agreement and the applicable SOW, and Vendor shall perform the Services in accordance with the updated scope and terms.

13.4 **Effect on Fees and Schedule.**  
Client acknowledges that changes requested by Client may result in increased Fees and adjustments to project timelines. Vendor shall not be required to proceed with any change that materially impacts its resource commitments or commercial assumptions unless the Parties have agreed in writing on the corresponding adjustments.
