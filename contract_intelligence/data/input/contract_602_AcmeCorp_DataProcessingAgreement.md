## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.**  
For purposes of Applicable Data Protection Laws, Client acts as Controller (or Business), and Vendor acts as Processor (or Service Provider) with respect to Personal Data Processed under this Agreement.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.**  
Vendor shall Process Personal Data only:

  a. In accordance with Client’s documented Instructions (which may be set out in this Agreement, the Master Agreement, SOWs, or other written communications);

  b. As necessary to provide the Services and Deliverables described in **Article II**;

  c. As required by Applicable Data Protection Laws; in such case, Vendor shall inform Client of the legal requirement prior to Processing, unless prohibited by law.

If Vendor believes that an Instruction violates Applicable Data Protection Laws, Vendor shall promptly notify Client and may suspend execution of the Instruction pending resolution.

11.3 **Compliance with Applicable Data Protection Laws.**  
Vendor shall comply with Applicable Data Protection Laws in its Processing of Personal Data on behalf of Client, including:

  a. GDPR obligations applicable to Processors, to the extent GDPR applies to the Processing;

CCPA/CPRA requirements applicable to Service Providers, including not selling or sharing Personal Information as those terms are defined in CCPA/CPRA, and not retaining, using, or disclosing Personal Information for any purpose other than the business purposes specified in this Agreement or as otherwise permitted by law.

11.4 **Security Measures.**  
Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational Security Measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such Security Measures shall include, as appropriate:

  a. Encryption of Personal Data in transit over public networks and at rest where reasonably practicable;

  c. Regular vulnerability assessments, security patching, and monitoring;

  d. Physical security controls for data centers and facilities where Personal Data is stored or processed;

  e. Incident response procedures for detecting, responding to, and mitigating Data Breaches.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed Personal Data Breach affecting Personal Data Processed by Vendor on behalf of Client, Vendor shall:

  a. Without undue delay, and in any event no later than seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the breach, notify Client and provide information reasonably sufficient to allow Client to comply with its notification obligations under Applicable Data Protection Laws;

  b. Take reasonable steps to contain, investigate, and remediate the breach;

  c. Cooperate with Client, at Client’s reasonable request and cost, in any required notifications to Data Subjects or regulatory authorities, and in responding to inquiries or investigations.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.**  
Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Vendor shall assist Client, insofar as possible, with appropriate technical and organizational measures, in fulfilling Client’s obligations to respond to Data Subjects’ requests to exercise their rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws (e.g., access, rectification, deletion, data portability, restriction, and objection). If Vendor receives a request directly from a Data Subject relating to Personal Data Processed under this Agreement, Vendor shall promptly forward the request to Client, and shall not respond to the request except as instructed by Client or required by law.

11.7 **Sub-processors.**  
Client authorizes Vendor to engage Sub-processors for the Processing of Personal Data, provided that:

  a. Vendor enters into a written agreement with each Sub-processor that imposes data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement; and

  b. Vendor remains liable for the acts and omissions of its Sub-processors to the same extent Vendor would be liable if performing the Services directly.

Upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall provide a current list of Sub-processors involved in Processing Personal Data. Client may reasonably object to a new Sub-processor for data protection reasons, in which case the Parties shall work in good faith to address the concerns or, if no resolution is possible, Client may terminate the affected Services without penalty.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services or as required by applicable law. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall:

  a. Return Personal Data to Client in a commonly used electronic format, and/or

  b. Delete or anonymize Personal Data, except to the extent retention is required by applicable law, in which case Vendor shall continue to protect the retained data in accordance with this Agreement.

11.9 **Data Transfers.**  
If Vendor transfers Personal Data across national borders, Vendor shall ensure that such transfers comply with Applicable Data Protection Laws, including the use of appropriate transfer mechanisms (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or an equivalent framework) where required. Vendor shall provide Client with information regarding the location of data centers where Personal Data is stored or processed upon request.

  a. Any audit shall be conducted during regular business hours and upon reasonable prior written notice of at least thirty (30) days, and shall not unreasonably interfere with Vendor’s business operations;

  b. Client may conduct such audit no more than once annually, unless required by a supervisory authority or in the event of a confirmed Data Breach;

  c. Client shall ensure that any auditor is bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those in **Article V**.

12.2 **Response and Resolution Times.**  
Vendor shall provide technical support to Client during Vendor’s standard support hours as communicated in writing. Vendor shall adhere to the following target response time commitments:

  b. **Severity 2 (High)** – Major functionality impaired with significant business impact and no effective workaround: initial response within 4 hours; Vendor endeavors to resolve within 24 hours.

  c. **Severity 3 (Medium)** – Partial loss of functionality with moderate business impact or a workaround exists: initial response within 1 Business Day; Vendor endeavors to resolve within 5 Business Days.

  d. **Severity 4 (Low)** – Minor issues, cosmetic defects, or general questions: response within 2 Business Days.

12.3 **SLA Credits.**  
If Vendor fails to meet the uptime commitment in **Section 12.1**, Client may be eligible for service credits as follows:

  a. Monthly uptime between 99.0% and 99.9%: service credit equal to 5% of the monthly subscription fees for the affected Services.

  b. Monthly uptime between 98.0% and 99.0%: service credit equal to 10% of the monthly subscription fees.

  c. Monthly uptime below 98.0%: service credit equal to 20% of the monthly subscription fees.

To receive credits, Client must request them in writing within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the failure occurred. Service credits shall be applied against future subscription fees and shall not be redeemable for cash.

12.4 **Exclusive Remedies for SLA Breach.**  
Service credits provided under this **Article XII** constitute Client’s sole and exclusive remedy, and Vendor’s entire liability, for failure to meet the uptime commitment and response times described herein, without prejudice to Client’s termination rights under **Article IV**.

Vendor shall not be obligated to commence work on any change until the Parties have agreed in writing to the corresponding changes in scope, fees, and schedule.

13.4 **Emergency Changes.**

14.3 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through escalation within thirty (30) days of escalation notice, the Parties agree to attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute by mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) or another mutually agreed mediator in Houston, Texas. The mediation shall be conducted confidentially, and each Party shall bear its own costs, with the mediator’s fees shared equally.

14.4 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days of appointment of the mediator, either Party may pursue any available legal or equitable remedies. The Parties agree that, unless they mutually agree to binding arbitration, any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Harris County, Texas, and each Party hereby submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection to venue or forum non conveniens.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief or other equitable remedies from a court of competent jurisdiction at any time to protect its Confidential Information or intellectual property, or to prevent actual or threatened Data Breach or other irreparable harm.
