## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with Applicable Law governing the processing and protection of Personal Data, including but not limited to GDPR and CCPA, to the extent applicable to such Party’s processing activities under this Amendment.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  
For purposes of data protection laws:  
(a) Company shall be deemed the "controller" (or "business" under CCPA) with respect to Company Data; and  
(b) Vendor shall act as a "processor" (or "service provider" under CCPA) solely processing Company Data on behalf of Company and in accordance with Company’s documented instructions as set forth in this Amendment.

11.3 **Processing of Company Data.**  
Vendor shall:  
(a) Process Company Data only for the purposes of providing the Services and as otherwise instructed by Company in writing, unless required otherwise by Applicable Law (in which case Vendor shall inform Company of such requirement unless legally prohibited);  
(b) Implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Company Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Company Data;  
(c) Restrict access to Company Data to personnel and Subcontractors who have a legitimate need to know for the performance of the Services and who are bound by confidentiality and data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth herein; and  
(d) Not "sell" or "share" (as those terms are defined under CCPA) Company Data, nor retain, use, or disclose Company Data for any purpose other than the business purposes specified in this Amendment, except as expressly permitted or required by Applicable Law.

11.4 **Subprocessors.**  
Vendor may engage Subcontractors that process Company Data ("**Subprocessors**"), provided that Vendor enters into written agreements with such Subprocessors imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those imposed on Vendor under this Article XI. Vendor shall remain liable for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors in relation to Company Data.

11.5 **Data Subject Requests.**  
To the extent Company is required to respond to requests from individuals to exercise their rights under Applicable Law (e.g., rights of access, correction, deletion), Vendor shall provide reasonable assistance to Company, at Company’s expense, by providing relevant information or functionality, to enable Company to comply with such requests, provided that Company has provided Vendor with sufficient details to locate and identify the relevant Company Data.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Vendor shall retain Company Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Amendment, or upon Company’s written request, Vendor shall, at Company’s option, either: (a) delete (render unrecoverable) all Company Data in its possession or control; or (b) return such Company Data to Company in a mutually agreed format, subject to Vendor’s rights to retain copies as required by law or for backup/audit purposes, provided such retained copies remain subject to the obligations in this Article XI until deletion.
