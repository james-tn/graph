## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)

12.1 **Scope.**  
This Article XII describes the Service Levels applicable to Vendor’s managed services and support under Phase 4 and Phase 5.

12.2 **Availability.**  
Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the production environment for the cloud hosting and data platform components managed by Vendor is available **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and Excluded Downtime (the “**Availability Commitment**”).

  12.2.1 “**Scheduled Maintenance**” means maintenance that Vendor schedules in advance and notifies Client of at least forty-eight (48) hours beforehand, and that occurs during agreed maintenance windows.

  12.2.2 “**Excluded Downtime**” means downtime caused by: (a) Client’s acts or omissions; (b) third-party providers (e.g., cloud infrastructure providers) beyond Vendor’s reasonable control; (c) Force Majeure Events; or (d) Scheduled Maintenance.

12.3 **Incident Response and Resolution.**  
Vendor shall respond to and work to resolve incidents in accordance with the following target response and resolution times:

| Priority | Description                                | Response Time (Target) | Resolution / Workaround (Target) |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| P1      | Critical – system down, major impact       | 1 hour                 | 4 hours                          |
| P2      | High – significant degradation             | 2 hours                | 8 hours                          |
| P3      | Medium – limited impact or workaround      | 4 hours                | 2 Business Days                  |
| P4      | Low – minor impact, informational          | 1 Business Day         | 5 Business Days                  |

Times are measured from when Vendor’s support desk receives a properly logged incident notification.

12.4 **Remedies for SLA Breaches (Vendor-Favorable).**  
If Vendor fails to meet the Availability Commitment in a given calendar month, Client may be eligible for service credits as follows:

  12.4.1 Availability between 99.0% and 99.9%: credit equal to 3% of the monthly managed services fees;

  12.4.2 Availability between 98.0% and 99.0%: credit equal to 5% of the monthly managed services fees;

  12.4.3 Availability below 98.0%: credit equal to 10% of the monthly managed services fees.

Service credits:

  (a) Must be requested by Client in writing within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the breach occurred;  
  (b) Are applied against future invoices and have no cash value; and  
  (c) Shall be Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the Availability Commitment or other SLA metrics.

13.1 **Change Requests.**  
Either Party may submit written requests to change the scope, Deliverables, timelines, Service Levels, or other aspects of the Services (each, a “**Change Request**”).

13.2 **Change Order Process.**  

  13.2.1 Upon receipt of a Change Request, Vendor shall evaluate the requested change and provide Client with a written impact assessment, including any changes to effort, fees, Milestones, or assumptions.

  13.2.2 If the Parties agree on the proposed changes, they shall document them in a **Change Order** signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. No Change Request shall be binding until a Change Order is executed.

  13.2.3 Vendor shall have no obligation to commence work on any change until the corresponding Change Order is fully executed.

13.3 **Impact on Fees and Timelines.**  
Changes to the scope or assumptions may result in adjustments to the Contract Value, individual phase budgets, Milestones, and timelines. For high-risk, complex Projects, Client acknowledges that changes requested by Client, or delays caused by Client’s actions or inactions, may significantly impact the Project schedule and cost.

13.4 **Emergency Changes.**  
For urgent production issues requiring immediate action to prevent or mitigate significant business impact, Vendor may proceed with emergency work upon Client’s verbal or email authorization, with a written Change Order to follow as soon as reasonably practicable.

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**

If the dispute remains unresolved thirty (30) days after escalation to senior management, either Party may request that the Parties engage in non-binding mediation administered by a mutually agreed mediation service, with the mediation to take place in **Seattle, Washington**, unless otherwise agreed, and each Party to bear its own costs of mediation.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  

  14.3.1 If mediation fails to resolve the dispute within sixty (60) days after the mediator is appointed (or such longer period as the Parties may agree), either Party may pursue any available legal or equitable remedies.

  14.3.2 Any litigation arising out of or relating to this SOW shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in **King County, Washington**, and each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection based on improper venue or forum non conveniens.

14.4 **Injunctive Relief.**  
Nothing herein shall prevent either Party from seeking immediate injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or curtail an actual or threatened breach of Articles V, VI, or XI.
