11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  
The Parties acknowledge that, with respect to personal data of the Company’s employees, candidates, or other individuals, the Company will generally act as “controller” (or equivalent term under applicable law), and the Service Provider will act as “processor” or “service provider,” processing such data solely on the documented instructions of the Company and for the purposes of providing the Services.

The Service Provider shall:
