## ARTICLE XI. DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its processing of Personal Data under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, damage, alteration, or disclosure.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.** As between the Parties, Client shall be deemed the “controller” (or equivalent term under applicable law) of Personal Data, and Vendor shall be deemed the “processor” (or equivalent term) when processing Personal Data on Client’s behalf. Client shall determine the purposes and means of processing Personal Data, and Vendor shall process Personal Data solely in accordance with Client’s documented instructions, this Agreement, and Applicable Law.

11.3 **Data Processing Instructions.** Client instructs Vendor to process Personal Data solely to provide the Services and Deliverables and to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Vendor shall promptly notify Client if Vendor believes that any processing instruction infringes Data Protection Laws.

11.4 **Sub‑Processors.** Vendor may engage subcontractors (sub‑processors) to process Personal Data, provided Vendor:

  (a) imposes on such sub‑processors data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Article XI; and  

  (b) remains responsible for the acts and omissions of such sub‑processors as if they were Vendor’s own.

Vendor shall maintain a list of sub‑processors involved in processing Personal Data and shall, upon Client’s written request, provide a current copy of such list.

  (b) encryption of Personal Data in transit over public networks and at rest, where reasonably appropriate;  

  (c) regular vulnerability management and patching; and  

  (d) incident detection and response processes.

Client shall be responsible for assessing and determining the appropriate response to such requests.

11.9 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a confirmed unauthorized access to, or acquisition, loss, or disclosure of, Personal Data or Client’s Confidential Information in Vendor’s possession or control that constitutes a “personal data breach” under Data Protection Laws (**“Data Breach”**), Vendor shall:

  (c) cooperate reasonably with Client in investigating and remediating the Data Breach, subject to Vendor’s internal policies and Applicable Law.

Client shall be responsible for any notifications to data subjects or regulators, except to the extent such responsibility is allocated to Vendor under Applicable Law or a separate data processing agreement.

  - Availability below 98.0%: credit equal to 20% of the monthly recurring fees for the affected service.

Service credits shall be applied to future invoices and shall not be redeemable for cash. Service credits shall be Client’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for Vendor’s failure to meet the availability target, without limiting any other rights Client may have under this Agreement.

12.5 **Exclusions.** Vendor shall have no liability for failure to meet Service Levels to the extent caused by:

  (a) Client’s misuse or unauthorized modification of the Services;

13.5 **No Obligation to Agree.** Neither Party shall be obligated to accept any Change Request. If the Parties are unable to agree on a Change Order, the existing scope, fees, and timelines shall remain in effect.
