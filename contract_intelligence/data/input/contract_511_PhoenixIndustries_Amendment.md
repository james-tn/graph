## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Uncapped Liability – Confirmation.** The Parties expressly confirm that **Section 9.1 (Uncapped Liability – High Risk Engagement)** of the Master Agreement remains in full force and effect. Phoenix’s liability under the Master Agreement, this Amendment, and all Program SOWs continues to be **uncapped** (i.e., not subject to any contractual monetary cap), in light of the High-Risk nature of the engagement.

9.2 **Consequential Damages.** The Parties further confirm that, pursuant to **Section 9.2 (Damages)** of the Master Agreement, **consequential damages (including lost profits, loss of business, and loss of data) are expressly included as recoverable damages** to the extent proven under applicable law. The Parties acknowledge that this position is atypical in lower-risk engagements and that they have taken this expanded risk allocation into account in agreeing to the Amendment Contract Value and other terms herein.

9.3 **Exclusions From Any Limitation.** The exclusions from any limitation set forth in **Section 9.3 (Exclusions From Any Limitation)** of the Master Agreement apply to this Amendment, including:

  (a) Indemnification obligations under **Article VIII**;  

  (b) Breaches of **confidentiality obligations** under **Article V**;  

  (c) Gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct; and  

  (d) Contoso’s obligation to pay Fees and expenses.

9.4 **Risk Allocation.** The Parties reaffirm that the allocation of risk in **Article IX** of the Master Agreement and this Amendment is an essential element of their bargain and that the economic terms agreed (including the Amendment Contract Value and Net 45 Terms) would be substantially different absent such allocation.
