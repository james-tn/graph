## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.** For purposes of Applicable Data Protection Laws, Client is the “controller” or “business” and Vendor is the “processor” or “service provider” with respect to Personal Data Processed under this Agreement.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.** Vendor shall Process Personal Data only in accordance with:

  (a) Client’s documented instructions as set forth in this Agreement and any SOW;  
  (b) as necessary to comply with applicable law, in which case Vendor shall inform Client of the legal requirement before Processing (unless that law prohibits such disclosure); or  
  (c) as otherwise expressly authorized in writing by Client.

11.3 **Compliance with Applicable Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with the performance of this Agreement. Vendor shall provide reasonable assistance to Client, at Client’s cost where substantial effort is required, in fulfilling Client’s obligations under such laws, including responding to data subject requests, data protection impact assessments, and consultations with supervisory authorities, as described in **Section 11.6**.

11.4 **Security Measures.** Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, including:

  (a) encryption of Personal Data at rest and in transit using industry‑standard encryption;  
  (b) access controls based on the principle of least privilege;  
  (c) regular vulnerability assessments and application of security patches;  
  (d) data backup and recovery processes;  
  (e) logging and monitoring of access to systems that Process Personal Data; and  
  (f) security awareness training for personnel with access to Personal Data.

11.5 **Security Incidents.** In the event of a Security Incident, Vendor shall:

  (a) notify Client without undue delay and, where feasible, within seventy‑two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Security Incident;  
  (b) provide Client with information reasonably required to comply with its obligations under Applicable Data Protection Laws, including a description of the nature of the Security Incident, the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records affected, and the measures taken or proposed to address the Security Incident;  
  (c) promptly take all reasonable steps to contain, investigate, and remediate the Security Incident; and  
  (d) cooperate with Client, at Vendor’s expense where Vendor is responsible for the Security Incident, in any investigation, notification, or remediation actions.

11.6 **Data Subject and Consumer Rights.** Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Vendor shall assist Client, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, in fulfilling Client’s obligations to respond to requests from data subjects or consumers to exercise their rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of access, rectification, deletion, restriction, portability, or objection). Vendor shall promptly forward to Client any such request received directly by Vendor.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by applicable law. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall promptly delete or return all Personal Data in its possession or control, at Client’s option, except to the extent retention is required by law. Vendor shall certify in writing its completion of deletion or return, as applicable.

11.8 **Data Transfers.** To the extent Vendor Processes Personal Data subject to the GDPR or other similar laws outside the originating jurisdiction, the Parties shall enter into appropriate data transfer mechanisms, such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent instruments, as required by law. In the absence of such mechanisms, Vendor shall Process such data only within the jurisdiction designated by Client.

11.9 **Subprocessors.** Vendor may engage Subprocessors to Process Personal Data, provided that:

  (a) Vendor enters into a written agreement with each Subprocessor that imposes obligations on the Subprocessor that are no less protective of Personal Data than those imposed on Vendor under this Agreement;  
  (b) Vendor remains fully liable to Client for the performance of each Subprocessor’s obligations; and  
  (c) upon Client’s request, Vendor provides Client with a list of current Subprocessors and notifies Client of any intended changes, thereby giving Client the opportunity to object on reasonable data protection grounds.
