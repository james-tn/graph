2.3.2 No SOW or Change Order shall be binding unless executed by authorized representatives of both Parties. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and any SOW, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail unless the SOW expressly states that it is intended to modify this Agreement and specifically references the provision being modified.

2.4 **Deliverables and Milestones.**  

2.4.1 Vendor shall develop and deliver to Client the Deliverables specified in each SOW in accordance with the schedule and milestones set forth therein. Deliverables may include, without limitation, strategy reports, solution design documents, configuration specifications, test scripts, training materials, and implementation reports.

2.4.2 Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the timelines and milestones set forth in the SOW(s). Time shall not be of the essence unless expressly stated in a particular SOW. Delays caused by Client (including delays in providing required information, decisions, approvals, or access) shall entitle Vendor to a reasonable extension of time and, where applicable, an equitable adjustment in Fees, to be documented via Change Order.

2.4.3 Upon delivery of any Deliverable, Vendor shall notify Client in writing and provide any supporting documentation required by the SOW. Client shall, within the review period specified in the SOW (or, if not specified, within ten (10) Business Days), review the Deliverable to determine whether it materially conforms to the acceptance criteria set forth in the SOW.

2.4.4 If Client determines that a Deliverable does not materially conform to the acceptance criteria, Client shall provide Vendor with a written notice specifying the deficiencies in reasonable detail. Vendor shall, at no additional cost to Client (except to the extent the non-conformity arises from Client Materials, instructions, or third-party acts outside Vendor’s control), use commercially reasonable efforts to correct such deficiencies and resubmit the Deliverable for Client’s review. This process shall be repeated until acceptance or termination of the applicable SOW in accordance with Article IV.

2.4.5 A Deliverable shall be deemed accepted upon the earliest of: (a) Client’s written acceptance; (b) the expiration of the applicable review period without Client having provided a rejection notice; or (c) Client’s use of the Deliverable in a live production environment (other than for testing).

2.5 **Performance Standards.**  

2.5.1 Vendor shall perform the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner, in accordance with generally accepted industry standards for similar consulting services and with due skill, care, and diligence.

2.5.2 Vendor shall assign appropriately qualified personnel to perform the Services and shall ensure that such personnel have the requisite skills, experience, and training to perform their assigned tasks.

Client acknowledges that the successful and timely performance of the Services requires the good faith cooperation of Client. Accordingly:

2.6.1 Client shall provide Vendor with timely access to Client’s premises, systems, data, personnel, and other resources reasonably required for Vendor to perform the Services and deliver the Deliverables.

2.6.2 Client shall be responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and legality of Client Materials and any instructions or decisions provided to Vendor. Vendor shall be entitled to rely on such Client Materials and instructions without independent verification.

2.6.3 Client shall designate a primary contact person with sufficient authority to provide approvals, make decisions, and act as Vendor’s primary point of contact in connection with the Services.

2.6.4 Client’s failure to perform its obligations in this Section 2.6 may result in delays, additional costs, or non-performance by Vendor, for which Vendor shall not be liable. Vendor shall promptly notify Client of any such anticipated impacts.

2.7 **Subcontractors.** Vendor may engage subcontractors to perform the Services, provided that Vendor shall remain fully responsible for the acts and omissions of its subcontractors as if they were Vendor’s own and shall ensure that any subcontractors are bound by confidentiality and data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement.
