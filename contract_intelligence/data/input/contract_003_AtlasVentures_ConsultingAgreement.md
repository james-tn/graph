2.1 **Engagement of Atlas.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Contoso hereby engages Atlas, and Atlas hereby accepts such engagement, to provide the Services described herein and in one or more SOWs executed by the Parties during the Term. The Parties anticipate that the Services will include, without limitation, strategic advisory, operational consulting, process optimization, technology transformation support, and related implementation planning activities.

2.2 **General Description of Services.**  
Atlas shall perform, at a minimum, the following categories of Services, which shall be further detailed and customized in one or more SOWs:

  (a) **Strategic Assessment and Advisory.** Atlas shall conduct a comprehensive assessment of Contoso’s current business operations, market positioning, competitive landscape, organizational structure, and technology environment. This shall include stakeholder interviews with key personnel, review of relevant documentation, analysis of financial and operational data, and benchmarking against industry standards. Based on this assessment, Atlas shall develop and present strategic recommendations to optimize business performance, identify new growth opportunities, and improve operational efficiency.

  (b) **Operational and Process Optimization.** Atlas shall analyze Contoso’s core business processes (including but not limited to sales, marketing, customer support, supply chain, and back-office functions) and identify opportunities for streamlining, automation, and cost reduction. Atlas shall propose redesigned processes, including process maps, roles and responsibilities, workflow descriptions, and key performance indicators (KPIs). Atlas may also assist in developing standard operating procedures and governance frameworks to support these optimized processes.

  (c) **Technology and Digital Transformation Advisory.** Atlas shall review Contoso’s technology platforms, applications, data architecture, and infrastructure, and shall provide recommendations for modernization, consolidation, or replacement, as appropriate. This may include guidance on selection of third-party software, cloud migration strategies, data analytics initiatives, and integration architectures. Atlas’s role shall be advisory in nature, and Atlas shall not be responsible for procuring software or hardware unless explicitly stated in an SOW.

  (d) **Implementation Roadmap and Change Management.** Based on the strategic and operational recommendations, Atlas shall develop a phased implementation roadmap setting forth recommended initiatives, timelines, resource requirements, dependencies, and risk mitigation measures. Atlas shall also provide change management advisory services, which may include stakeholder engagement planning, communication strategies, training support, and organizational readiness assessments.

  (e) **Performance Tracking and Reporting.** Atlas shall assist Contoso in designing and implementing metrics, dashboards, and reporting mechanisms to track progress against agreed-on KPIs and strategic objectives. Atlas shall periodically review and refine these metrics based on feedback and evolving business needs.

2.3 **Deliverables.**  
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Deliverables to be produced by Atlas may include, but are not limited to, the following (as more specifically defined in the applicable SOWs):

  (a) written assessment reports and diagnostic summaries;  
  (b) strategic recommendation reports, including executive summaries;  
  (c) process documentation, including “as-is” and “to-be” process maps;

  (e) implementation roadmaps, including Gantt charts, milestones, and dependencies;  
  (f) operating model design documents, governance frameworks, and RACI matrices;  
  (g) training materials, playbooks, and internal communications artifacts; and  
  (h) periodic status reports and presentations.

Each SOW shall specify the particular Deliverables, their format, quality standards, acceptance criteria, and delivery dates.

2.4 **Performance Standards.**  
Atlas shall perform the Services:

  (a) in a professional and workmanlike manner, in accordance with generally accepted industry standards for consulting services of a similar nature;  

  (b) by personnel who are appropriately trained, experienced, and qualified for their assigned roles;  

  (c) in material conformance with the Project Plan, Service Levels, and other specifications set forth in this Agreement and the applicable SOW; and  

  (d) in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and professional standards.

Atlas shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the milestones and timelines set forth in each SOW. Time is important, but unless expressly stated otherwise in an SOW, time is not of the essence; however, repeated or material delays not excused by Contoso’s acts or omissions or by a Force Majeure Event may constitute a material breach subject to the cure provisions in Section 4.3.

2.5 **Contoso Responsibilities.**  
Contoso acknowledges that Atlas’s ability to perform the Services depends on Contoso’s timely and effective cooperation. Accordingly, Contoso shall:

  (a) provide Atlas with timely access to relevant systems, facilities, personnel, records, and information as reasonably necessary for Atlas to perform the Services;  

  (b) designate one or more knowledgeable employees to serve as primary points of contact for Atlas and to make or facilitate decisions and approvals required for the project;  

  (c) review Deliverables and other outputs promptly and provide timely feedback and approvals, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed;  

  (d) ensure that any information or materials provided to Atlas are accurate, complete, and not misleading; and  

  (e) perform any Contoso obligations or activities identified in the applicable SOW.

Atlas shall not be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of the Services to the extent caused by Contoso’s failure to fulfill its responsibilities under this Agreement.

2.6 **Subcontractors.**  
Atlas may use subcontractors or independent contractors (“**Subcontractors**”) to perform portions of the Services, provided that: (a) Atlas remains fully responsible for the performance of the Services and for the acts and omissions of its Subcontractors; (b) any Subcontractors who will have access to Confidential Information or Personal Data sign written agreements obligating them to confidentiality and data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth herein; and (c) Atlas shall be responsible for ensuring such Subcontractors comply with this Agreement.

2.7 **Acceptance of Deliverables.**  
Each SOW shall specify acceptance criteria and acceptance procedures for Deliverables. Unless otherwise stated in the SOW:

  (a) Contoso shall have ten (10) Business Days (the “**Review Period**”) after delivery of a Deliverable to review and either: (i) accept the Deliverable in writing; or (ii) reject it by providing a written notice specifying in reasonable detail the deficiencies with reference to the applicable acceptance criteria.  

  (b) If Contoso timely rejects a Deliverable, Atlas shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the identified deficiencies and resubmit the Deliverable within a reasonable period agreed by the Parties.  

  (c) The foregoing process shall be repeated as necessary, but if after two (2) resubmissions the Deliverable still does not materially conform to the acceptance criteria, Contoso may, as its sole and exclusive remedy, either: (i) require further correction and resubmission; or (ii) reject the Deliverable and, at Contoso’s election, receive an equitable adjustment to the Fees reflecting the defective portion of the Deliverable.  

  (d) If Contoso does not respond in writing within the Review Period, the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted as of the end of the Review Period.
