9.1 **Uncapped Liability (High‑Risk).** In deviation from **Section 9.2 (Aggregate Liability Cap)** of the Parent DPA, and solely with respect to claims arising from or relating to this Amendment and the Amendment Services, **there shall be no contractual monetary cap on either Party’s aggregate liability to the other Party**. The Parties acknowledge that this uncapped liability allocation is appropriate given the high‑risk nature of the Enhanced Data Processing Services.

9.2 **Consequential and Special Damages.** In further deviation from **Section 9.1 (Exclusion of Certain Damages)** of the Parent DPA, and solely with respect to claims arising from or relating to this Amendment:

  - **Neither Party excludes consequential, incidental, special, or punitive damages** as a category of recoverable damages.  

The Parties expressly intend that Contoso and Horizon may recover consequential and similar damages for breaches of this Amendment, subject to Applicable Law.

9.3 **Exceptions and Interaction with Parent DPA.** For clarity:

  (a) The limitations and cap in **Article IX of the Parent DPA** shall continue to apply to claims that arise exclusively under the Parent DPA and not from this Amendment.  

  (b) To the extent a claim spans both the Parent DPA and this Amendment, the Parties agree that such claim shall not be subject to any monetary cap and consequential damages shall not be excluded, but duplicative recovery shall not be permitted.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.** The Parties acknowledge that the uncapped liability and inclusion of consequential damages in this Article IX reflect an intentional allocation of risk based on the **High** risk rating, the nature of the Amendment Services, and the respective interests of the Parties.
