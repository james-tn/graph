## ARTICLE III. FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Fees.**  
In consideration of the Services and Deliverables provided by Vanguard under this Agreement, Contoso shall pay Vanguard fees in an aggregate amount not to exceed the **Contract Value** of **US$2,050,013**, unless otherwise agreed in a written amendment or additional SOW. The specific fees for each SOW may be structured as:

Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable SOW, partial completion of milestones may entitle Vanguard to proportionate invoicing based on work performed.

3.3 **Invoicing.**  
Vanguard shall invoice Contoso upon completion of the relevant milestone(s) or monthly in arrears for T&M services, as specified in the applicable SOW. Each invoice shall:

  (a) reference the contract number **NDA-VAN-202505-505** and the applicable SOW;

Payment shall be made in U.S. Dollars by wire transfer or other mutually agreed method. Contoso may withhold payment of any amounts that Contoso reasonably and in good faith disputes, provided that Contoso: (a) pays any undisputed portion in accordance with this Section 3.4; and (b) provides written notice of the dispute, specifying the basis for the dispute, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the disputed invoice. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to promptly resolve any such disputes.

3.5 **Late Payment.**  
Any undisputed amount not paid when due shall accrue interest at the lesser of: (a) one percent (1%) per month; or (b) the maximum interest rate permitted by applicable law, calculated from the date such amount was due until the date it is paid in full.

Vanguard shall provide written notice to Contoso of any late payment before suspending Services.

3.6 **Expenses and Reimbursement.**  
Contoso shall reimburse Vanguard for reasonable, pre‑approved out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred in connection with the performance of the Services, including travel, lodging, and meals, in accordance with Contoso’s then‑current corporate travel and expense policy (to be provided to Vanguard upon request). Vanguard shall provide supporting documentation (e.g., receipts) with each invoice for reimbursable expenses. Vanguard shall not be entitled to reimbursement for expenses that are not pre‑approved in writing by Contoso.

3.7 **Taxes.**  
All fees are exclusive of any sales, use, value‑added, or other similar taxes, duties, or charges imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, “**Taxes**”), except for taxes based on Vanguard’s net income, property, or employees. Contoso shall be responsible for all Taxes associated with the Services, other than Vanguard’s income‑related taxes. If Vanguard is required by law to collect and remit Taxes, Vanguard shall include such Taxes on the invoice, and Contoso shall pay such amounts unless Contoso provides a valid tax exemption certificate.
