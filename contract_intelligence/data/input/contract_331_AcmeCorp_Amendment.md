In the event any portion of the platform or Vendor Materials is, or in Vendor’s reasonable opinion is likely to be, the subject of an infringement Claim, Vendor may, at its option and expense:

(b) modify or replace the affected materials to make them non-infringing while ensuring substantially equivalent functionality; or  
(c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected Services and refund to Client any prepaid Fees for the terminated period on a pro rata basis.

8.5 **Exclusions.**  
Vendor shall have no indemnification obligation for infringement Claims to the extent arising from:  
(a) modifications to the platform or Vendor Materials made by or on behalf of Client without Vendor’s written approval;  
(b) combination or use of the platform or Vendor Materials with products, services, hardware, or software not supplied or approved by Vendor, where the infringement would not have occurred but for such combination or use; or  
(c) Client’s use of the Services in violation of this Amendment.
