**WHEREAS**, this Addendum **adds licensed users/modules dated November 18, 2024 (Ref: SLA-ATL-202411-617)** and is entered into **pursuant to** and as an **addendum to** the Parent Agreement **SLA-ATL-202411-617 (contract_617)**;

**WHEREAS**, pursuant to **Section 16.2 (Amendments)** of the Parent Agreement, amendments and addenda must be in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both Parties, and the Parties intend this Addendum to satisfy such requirement with respect to the subject matter hereof;

**WHEREAS**, the Parties acknowledge that the Parent Agreement has a scheduled expiration date of **October 06, 2027**, whereas the Parties wish this Addendum to have a defined subterm ending earlier, on **April 30, 2027**, within the existing Term of the Parent Agreement;

This Addendum functions as a formal written expansion of such scope, in accordance with **Article XIII (Change Management)** of the Parent Agreement and **Section 16.2 (Amendments)** thereof.

2.1.3 This Addendum does not replace any SOW under the Parent Agreement. Instead, it adds to and modifies the license and Services framework for the Software, including expansions that may be reflected in existing or future SOWs.
