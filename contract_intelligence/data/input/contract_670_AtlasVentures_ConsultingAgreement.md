9.2 **Aggregate Liability Cap.**  
Subject to Sections 9.3 and 9.4, the total aggregate liability of each Party to the other for all claims arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (including all SOWs), whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, shall be limited to an amount equal to **two (2) times** the total Fees actually paid by Contoso to Atlas under this Agreement during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

For any online or hosted tools or portals provided by Atlas as part of the Services:
