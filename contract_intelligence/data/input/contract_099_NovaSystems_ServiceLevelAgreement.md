## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. In particular, Service Provider acknowledges that, in processing Personal Data on behalf of Client, it may act as a “processor” or “service provider” under applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.2 **Data Processing.** Service Provider shall process Personal Data solely on documented instructions from Client, as set forth in this Agreement and any SOW, except where otherwise required by Applicable Law. Service Provider shall not “sell” or “share” Personal Data as such terms are defined under the CCPA.

11.3 **Security Measures.** Service Provider shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, commensurate with the nature of the Personal Data and the risks associated with processing.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Service Provider may engage subprocessors to process Personal Data on its behalf, provided that:

  (a) Service Provider enters into a written agreement with each subprocessor imposing data protection obligations substantially similar to those set out in this Article XI;  
  (b) Service Provider remains fully liable to Client for the performance of its subprocessors;  
  (c) Upon Client’s request, Service Provider provides a list of subprocessors that process Personal Data in connection with the Services.

11.5 **Cross-Border Transfers.** To the extent Personal Data is transferred from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions requiring data transfer mechanisms, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses) as required by Data Protection Laws.

11.6 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a confirmed unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personal Data processed by Service Provider on behalf of Client (a **“Data Breach”**):

  (a) Service Provider shall notify Client without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  
  (b) Such notice shall include, to the extent known at the time: the nature of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects affected, the categories and approximate number of Personal Data records affected, the likely consequences, and the measures taken or proposed to address the Data Breach;  
  (c) Service Provider shall cooperate with Client, at Client’s reasonable request and expense, in fulfilling any legal obligations that Client may have to notify affected individuals or regulators.

11.7 **Data Subject Requests.** To the extent legally permissible, Service Provider shall promptly notify Client of any request received from a data subject seeking to exercise rights under Data Protection Laws with respect to Personal Data processed under this Agreement. Service Provider shall not respond directly to such requests without Client’s prior written authorization, except as required by law. Service Provider shall assist Client in responding to such requests, at Client’s expense to the extent such assistance exceeds reasonable efforts.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Service Provider shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services and to fulfill its legal obligations. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Client’s written request, Service Provider shall, at Client’s choice, delete or return all Personal Data in its possession, except to the extent retention is required by Applicable Law, in which case Service Provider shall continue to protect such Personal Data in accordance with this Agreement.

11.9 **Audits.** Upon reasonable prior written notice, and no more than once per twelve (12) month period (unless required by a Data Protection Authority or following a Data Breach), Client may audit Service Provider’s compliance with this Article XI by reviewing Service Provider’s relevant third-party audit reports (e.g., SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001), or by conducting an on-site inspection during normal business hours, subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations. Client shall bear its own costs and any out-of-pocket costs incurred by Service Provider in connection with such audits.

  (d) Downtime caused by Force Majeure Events;  
  (e) Downtime resulting from Client’s breach of this Agreement or misuse of the Services.

12.6 **Measurement and Reporting.** Service Provider shall measure Service availability using its monitoring tools and shall, upon request, provide Client with monthly Service Level reports summarizing uptime, Incident statistics, and any Service Credits due under Section 12.8.

12.7 **Service Level Failures.** A **Service Level Failure** occurs when the Uptime Commitment or other Service Levels in this Article XII are not met in a given calendar month, excluding Permitted Downtime.

12.8 **Service Credits.** In the event of a Service Level Failure, Client shall be eligible to receive Service Credits as follows:

  (a) If monthly uptime falls below 99.9% but is equal to or greater than 99.0%, Client shall receive a Service Credit equal to **5%** of the monthly recurring fees for the affected Services;  
  (b) If monthly uptime falls below 99.0% but is equal to or greater than 98.0%, Client shall receive a Service Credit equal to **10%** of the monthly recurring fees for the affected Services;  
  (c) If monthly uptime falls below 98.0%, Client shall receive a Service Credit equal to **20%** of the monthly recurring fees for the affected Services.

To receive a Service Credit, Client must submit a written request within thirty (30) days following the end of the month in which the Service Level Failure occurred. Service Credits shall be applied to the next invoice and shall not be redeemable for cash.

12.9 **Chronic Service Level Failures.** If Service Provider fails to meet the Uptime Commitment in three (3) or more consecutive calendar months or in any four (4) months during a rolling twelve (12) month period, Client may, as an additional remedy, terminate the affected Services or the Agreement for cause upon thirty (30) days’ written notice, without early termination fees.

13.2 **Impact Assessment.** Upon receipt of a Change Request, the receiving Party shall, within a reasonable time, evaluate the request and provide an impact assessment that includes:

13.4 **Proceeding at Risk.** If Client requests that Service Provider proceed with a Change Request prior to execution of a formal change order, Service Provider may, at its sole discretion, do so, provided that Client acknowledges in writing (e.g., via email) that it will be responsible for the additional costs and any schedule impacts reasonably incurred as a result of such work.

13.5 **No Implied Changes.** The Parties agree that discussions, emails, or informal agreements shall not, by themselves, constitute a binding change to the Agreement or an SOW. All changes shall be governed by this Article XIII.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.** If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within ninety (90) days after initial notice of the Dispute (or such longer period as the Parties may agree in writing), either Party may pursue its rights:

  (b) In the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, if both Parties expressly agree in writing to waive arbitration for a particular Dispute.

Unless otherwise agreed, arbitration shall be the default mechanism. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

14.4 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm, including but not limited to breaches of Articles V (Confidentiality) and XI (Data Protection and Privacy), without first complying with the negotiation and mediation procedures set forth in this Article XIV.
