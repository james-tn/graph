As of the Addendum Commencement Date, the term “Premises,” as used in the Parent Agreement, shall be deemed to refer to the **Expanded Premises**, comprised of both the Original Premises and the Additional Premises, except where (i) the Parent Agreement expressly refers to the original square footage only, or (ii) this Addendum expressly provides a different treatment for the Additional Premises (for example, with respect to Addendum Base Rent, Additional Charges allocation, or specific service levels).

(c) **No Release of Original Obligations.**  
The expansion of the Premises under this Addendum does not release or modify Contoso’s existing obligations under the Parent Agreement with respect to the Original Premises.

Quantum Labs shall provide electricity, water, HVAC, and telecommunications infrastructure to the Additional Premises consistent with the standards set forth in **Section 2.3.2 of the Parent Agreement**.

3.3 **Additional Charges Allocation.**  

(a) **Utilities and Services.**  
Contoso shall pay its pro rata or metered share of utilities and services attributable to the Additional Premises as Additional Charges pursuant to **Section 3.5.1 of the Parent Agreement**.

(b) **Net 60 Payment Terms.**  
Notwithstanding **Section 1.10 and Section 3.4(b) of the Parent Agreement**, which provide for **Net 30** payment terms, the Parties agree that, with respect solely to amounts due under this Addendum, **all undisputed amounts shall be due and payable within sixty (60) calendar days** following the date of the applicable invoice (“Net 60”).

(c) **Disputed Amounts.**  
If Contoso disputes any portion of an invoice issued under this Addendum, it shall (i) pay the undisputed portion by the Net 60 due date, and (ii) notify Quantum Labs in writing within **twenty (20) days** of receipt of the invoice, specifying the nature of the dispute in reasonable detail. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve the dispute. Any agreed adjustment shall be reflected on a subsequent invoice or credited against future payments.

3.5 **Late Payment Penalties.**  
If Contoso fails to pay any undisputed amount due under this Addendum by the Net 60 due date, and such failure continues for more than **ten (10) days** after written notice from Quantum Labs (which may be combined with notice under **Section 3.6 of the Parent Agreement**), then:  
(a) such overdue amount shall accrue interest at the lesser of (i) **one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month**, or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law, from the original due date until paid; and  
(b) Quantum Labs may, after an additional **ten (10) days’** written notice, suspend non-essential Additional Services to the Additional Premises until all overdue amounts, including interest, are paid, provided that building access and critical safety systems shall not be unreasonably restricted, consistent with **Section 3.6(b) of the Parent Agreement**.

(b) **Use and Replenishment.**  
Quantum Labs shall hold and may apply the Additional Security Deposit in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as set forth in **Section 3.8 of the Parent Agreement**, including application to cure defaults and Contoso’s obligation to replenish any applied amounts within thirty (30) days of written notice.

(c) **Return of Additional Security Deposit.**  
Subject to the terms of **Section 3.8 of the Parent Agreement**, any remaining portion of the Additional Security Deposit shall be returned to Contoso within **sixty (60) days** after the later of (i) the Addendum Expiration Date or earlier termination of this Addendum, and (ii) the date Contoso vacates and surrenders the Additional Premises in the condition required by this Addendum, less any amounts properly applied to outstanding obligations relating to the Additional Premises.

(a) **By Contoso.**  
Contoso may terminate this Addendum for convenience (with respect to the Additional Premises only) upon at least **sixty (60) days’ prior written notice** to Quantum Labs, provided that (i) all amounts due and payable under this Addendum through the effective date of termination are paid in full, and (ii) Contoso surrenders the Additional Premises in accordance with Section 4.6 below.

(b) **By Quantum Labs.**  
Quantum Labs may terminate this Addendum for convenience upon at least **ninety (90) days’ prior written notice** to Contoso, but only if Quantum Labs reasonably demonstrates a compelling operational need (e.g., redevelopment of the relevant floor) and offers Contoso a commercially reasonable alternative space within the Building or an affiliated facility on terms not materially less favorable than those in this Addendum. Nothing in this subsection modifies Contoso’s rights under **Section 4.4(b) of the Parent Agreement** with respect to termination for cause.

4.5 **Termination for Cause.**  

(a) **By Quantum Labs.**  
Quantum Labs may terminate this Addendum upon written notice to Contoso if a default by Contoso specific to the Additional Premises or obligations hereunder would constitute a material breach under **Section 4.4(a) of the Parent Agreement** and such breach is not cured within the applicable cure period specified therein (e.g., failure to pay undisputed amounts within thirty (30) days after notice).

(b) **By Contoso.**  
Contoso may terminate this Addendum upon written notice if Quantum Labs materially fails to provide access to or core building services for the Additional Premises as required hereunder and under **Section 4.4(b)(i) of the Parent Agreement**, and such failure continues for more than thirty (30) days after Contoso’s written notice, subject to any extension due to Force Majeure under **Article XV of the Parent Agreement**.

Upon expiration or earlier termination of this Addendum:

(d) All undisputed amounts properly invoiced under this Addendum through the effective date of termination shall become immediately due and payable.

(e) Termination or expiration of this Addendum shall not, by itself, terminate or affect the continuing validity of the Parent Agreement with respect to the Original Premises unless the Parent Agreement is separately terminated in accordance with its terms.

4.7 **Effect of Termination of Parent Agreement.**  

If the Parent Agreement is terminated or expires for any reason, this Addendum shall automatically terminate simultaneously, and the lease of the Additional Premises shall end on the same effective date, without the need for separate notice. In such case, the obligations in **Section 4.6 of this Addendum** shall apply to the Additional Premises, and the survival provisions of **Section 4.6 and 4.6 (Survival) of the Parent Agreement** shall apply mutatis mutandis to obligations under this Addendum.

4.8 **Survival.**  
Those provisions of this Addendum that by their nature should survive expiration or termination (including payment obligations accrued prior to termination, confidentiality, IP rights, indemnification, limitation of liability, and dispute resolution) shall so survive, consistent with **Section 4.6 of the Parent Agreement** and the analogous Articles in this Addendum.

If the uptime commitment is not met due to outages materially affecting the Additional Premises, Contoso shall be entitled, upon written request, to a service credit calculated in accordance with **Section 12.4 of the Parent Agreement**, based on the portion of Addendum Base Rent attributable to the affected quarter. Such credits shall be applied against future invoices and constitute Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for service failures, subject to the limitation of liability in **Article IX**.
