14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the breach thereof (a “Dispute”), the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the Dispute through good-faith negotiations between their respective project managers.
