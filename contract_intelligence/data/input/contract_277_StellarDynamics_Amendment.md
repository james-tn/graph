## ARTICLE X  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (MEDIUM RISK ADJUSTMENT)

10.1 **Modification of Parent Agreement’s Article IX.** The Parties expressly agree that **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)** of the Parent Agreement, which provides for **no contractual cap** on liability and permits recovery of consequential damages due to the high-risk classification, shall **not apply** to the Extended Services and Additional Deliverables under this Amendment. Instead, the provisions of this **Article X** shall apply to all Claims arising out of or relating to this Amendment, the Extended Services, the Additional Deliverables, and the Enhanced SLA, reflecting the **Medium Risk Classification**.

10.2 **Aggregate Liability Cap.**  

Except for the exclusions specified in Section 10.4 below, the total aggregate liability of each Party to the other Party arising out of or relating to this Amendment, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, shall in no event exceed **two (2) times the total fees actually paid by Client to Stellar Dynamics under this Amendment during the **twelve (12) month period** immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

10.3 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  

SUBJECT TO SECTION 10.4, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF DATA, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AMENDMENT, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

10.4 **Exceptions to Limitations.** The limitations and exclusions set forth in Sections 10.2 and 10.3 shall not apply to:

(a) A Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct;  
(b) A Party’s confidentiality obligations under Article VI of this Amendment and Article V of the Parent Agreement;  
(c) A Party’s indemnification obligations under Article IX of this Amendment and Article VIII of the Parent Agreement;  
(d) A Party’s breach of its data protection obligations under Article XI of this Amendment and Article XI of the Parent Agreement;  
(e) Any amounts due and payable by Client under Article IV of this Amendment (fees and Taxes).

10.5 **Legal Limitations.** Nothing in this Article X shall be construed to limit or exclude any liability that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable law, including liability for death or personal injury caused by a Party’s gross negligence, or for fraud, consistent with **Section 9.3** of the Parent Agreement.

10.6 **Interaction with Parent Agreement.** For avoidance of doubt, the uncapped and broader liability provisions in **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement continue to apply to the original scope under the Parent Agreement, but **not** to the Extended Services and Additional Deliverables governed by this Amendment.

## ARTICLE XI  
## INSURANCE

13.2 **Relationship to Parent SLA.** The Uptime Commitment of **99.9%** set forth in **Section 12.1** of the Parent Agreement shall continue to apply to the original scope of Services; however, for the Extended Services under this Amendment, the Enhanced SLA in this Article XIII (including the 99.95% Uptime Target) shall govern.

13.3 **Incident Classification and Response.** Severity Levels and target initial response times shall align with **Section 12.4** of the Parent Agreement, with the addition that:

(a) For Severity 1 incidents impacting both Production Regions, Stellar Dynamics will target an initial technical engagement within **thirty (30) minutes**;  

(b) For Severity 2 incidents related to failover or replication performance, the Parties may escalate to joint architecture reviews as necessary.

13.4 **Service Credits.** In case of Service Level Failures relating to the Extended Services, Client shall be entitled to service credits calculated on a scale to be set forth in an updated **Schedule C** issued pursuant to this Amendment. Such credits will be applied against maintenance or subscription fees related to the Extended Services and shall remain the exclusive monetary remedy for SLA breaches, without prejudice to Client’s termination rights under **Section 4.6** of the Parent Agreement (Termination for Repeated SLA Failures), as applicable to Extended Services.
