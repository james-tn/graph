2.1 **Relationship to Parent Agreement.**  

2.1.1 The Parties acknowledge that **Article II (Scope of Services / Work)** of the Master Services Agreement establishes a general master framework for Services to be provided under individual SOWs. This Amendment **does not replace** Article II of the Master Services Agreement but **supplements and modifies** it solely with respect to the High‑Risk Program described herein.  

2.1.2 Except as expressly modified by this Amendment, all provisions of **Article II** of the Master Services Agreement (including Sections 2.1 through 2.9 concerning General Scope, Types of Services, Deliverables, Performance Standards, Governance, Dependencies, Acceptance, Subcontracting, and Service Location) shall continue to apply to the Amended Services.

2.2 **Description of High‑Risk Program.**  

2.2.1 Pinnacle shall provide a comprehensive, business‑critical managed services program for Contoso’s **Core Systems**, including but not limited to:  

  (a) **Production Order‑Management Platform Support.** 24x7 monitoring, incident management, problem resolution, and performance tuning for Contoso’s order‑management infrastructure, with specific attention to transaction integrity, latency thresholds, and peak‑period scaling;  

  (b) **Customer‑Facing Web Portal Operations.** Ongoing operational support of the customer portal that interfaces with Contoso’s back‑office systems, including web application server management, API gateway oversight, and security patching;  

  (c) **Integration and Data‑Flow Management.** Support for and oversight of integrations between the Core Systems and third‑party logistics, payment, CRM, and analytics providers, including proactive monitoring of message queues, ETL processes, and error‑handling routines;  

  (d) **Incident Response and Root Cause Analysis.** End‑to‑end incident triage, response, and root cause analysis for Priority 1 and Priority 2 incidents as refined in Section 12.2 of this Amendment; and  

  (e) **Continuous Improvement and Operational Governance.** Periodic service reviews, performance reporting, and recommendations for optimization, aligning with the **Project Management and Governance** concepts in **Section 2.5 (Project Governance and Communication)** of the Master Services Agreement.

2.2.2 The Parties expressly agree that the High‑Risk Program is categorized as **High risk**, and that this categorization **supersedes** the “Low risk level” reference in the Recitals of the Master Services Agreement **only with respect to** the Amended Services. The corresponding risk allocation changes are reflected in **Article VIII (Indemnification)** and **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)** of this Amendment.

2.3 **Core Systems and Environments.**  

Pinnacle’s responsibilities under the High‑Risk Program shall cover the following environments, each of which shall be considered part of the **Core Systems** for purposes of this Amendment:

  (a) **Production Environment** for the order‑management and customer‑facing portal platforms, including associated databases, middleware, and integrations deployed in Contoso’s designated hosting environment;  

  (b) **Pre‑Production/Staging Environment** used for testing of critical changes and patches prior to production deployment; and  

  (c) **Disaster Recovery / Failover Environment**, where applicable, for the Core Systems, to the extent such environment is made available and accessible to Pinnacle by Contoso.

2.4 **Deliverables.**  

Without limiting **Section 2.3 (Deliverables)** of the Master Services Agreement, the following Deliverables shall be created and maintained by Pinnacle under this Amendment:

  (a) **Operational Runbooks and Playbooks** for the High‑Risk Program, detailing incident response steps, escalation paths, and standard operating procedures;  

  (b) **Monthly Performance and SLA Reports** summarizing uptime, incident metrics, root cause analyses, pending risks, and remediation status;  

  (c) **Updated Architecture and Data‑Flow Diagrams** for the Core Systems, maintained quarterly or upon material architectural change;  

  (d) **Security Configuration Baseline Documentation** describing applied security controls, patching schedules, and access control models for the Core Systems; and  

  (e) **Quarterly Continuous Improvement Plans** outlining proposed enhancements, process refinements, and technology upgrades.

Acceptance of Deliverables shall be governed by **Section 2.7 (Acceptance of Deliverables)** of the Master Services Agreement, except that the Acceptance Period for Deliverables under this Amendment shall be **fifteen (15) Business Days** instead of ten (10) Business Days, and **Section 2.7.3** is hereby modified accordingly for Amended Services only.

2.5 **Performance Standards.**  

2.5.1 Pinnacle shall perform the Amended Services in accordance with the performance standards set forth in **Section 2.4 (Performance Standards)** of the Master Services Agreement, and in addition shall:

  (a) Ensure availability and response commitments as set out in **Article XII (Service Level Agreements)** of this Amendment;  

  (b) Maintain staffing levels, skill sets, and on‑call coverage sufficient to meet the enhanced Incident Priority Level response times specified herein; and  

  (c) Provide proactive monitoring and alerting for the Core Systems on a 24x7 basis, including automated alerts for system outages, critical errors, and threshold breaches.

2.5.2 For the avoidance of doubt, failure to meet the SLA commitments established in **Article XII** shall be treated as a Service Level failure in accordance with the SLA Addendum and may, in cases of chronic failure, constitute a material breach under **Section 4.4 (Termination for Cause)** of the Master Services Agreement as supplemented by this Amendment.

2.6 **Governance and Communication Enhancements.**  

In addition to **Section 2.5 (Project Governance and Communication)** of the Master Services Agreement, the following governance measures shall apply to the High‑Risk Program:

  (b) **Quarterly Executive Steering Committee Meetings** involving senior executives of both Parties (at least VP‑level) to review overall program performance, strategic roadmap, and risk posture; and  

  (c) **Real‑Time Status Dashboards** accessible to Contoso, providing current system status, open incidents, and key SLA indicators.

2.7 **Dependencies and Client Responsibilities.**  

The provisions of **Section 2.6 (Dependencies and Client Responsibilities)** of the Master Services Agreement shall apply in full to the Amended Services. In addition, Contoso shall:

  (a) Provide Pinnacle with continuous access to monitoring tools, logs, and administration interfaces necessary to perform the High‑Risk Program;  

  (b) Ensure that internal change management processes (including approvals for production changes) are executed within timelines that do not prevent Pinnacle from meeting its SLA commitments; and  

  (c) Designate a **24x7 internal escalation contact** for urgent matters relating to the Core Systems.

Pinnacle shall not be liable for delays or failures to meet SLAs to the extent directly attributable to Contoso’s failure to fulfill these obligations, provided Pinnacle has given prompt written notice in accordance with **Section 2.6** of the MSA and **Section 16.10 (Notices)** thereof.

2.8 **Subcontracting.**  

Any subcontracting for Amended Services shall remain subject to **Section 2.8 (Subcontracting)** of the Master Services Agreement. Given the High‑Risk nature of the program, Pinnacle shall not subcontract any material portion of the Amended Services outside of the United States **without Contoso’s prior written consent**, and any subcontractors involved in the High‑Risk Program shall be subject to specific security and confidentiality vetting consistent with the **Enhanced Security Controls** described in Article XI of this Amendment.

Compelled disclosure of Confidential Information shall be handled in accordance with **Section 5.4 (Compelled Disclosure)** of the Master Services Agreement.

## ARTICLE VI  
## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

6.1 **Relationship to MSA IP Provisions.**  

The Parties reaffirm and incorporate by reference **Article VI (Intellectual Property Rights)** of the Master Services Agreement, including Sections 6.1–6.7. The following provisions clarify and, in certain respects, modify the IP allocation solely as it pertains to the Amended Services.

6.2 **Pre‑Existing IP and Work Made for Hire.**  

6.2.1 The concept of Pre‑Existing IP as defined in **Section 6.1 (Pre-Existing IP)** of the Master Services Agreement applies in full to the Amended Services.  

6.2.2 **Section 6.2 (Ownership of Deliverables – Client-Friendly Work Made for Hire)** is acknowledged; however, due to the High‑Risk nature of the program and the shared operational character of certain artifacts (e.g., runbooks, monitoring configurations), the Parties agree that:  

  (a) All Deliverables created **exclusively** for Contoso under the Amended Services (excluding Pinnacle’s Pre‑Existing IP and Third‑Party Materials) shall remain subject to Section 6.2 of the MSA and, to the extent permitted by law, shall be deemed “work made for hire” owned by Contoso upon full and final payment of all undisputed Fees related to such Deliverables;  

  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pinnacle shall retain ownership of general operational methodologies, templates, and tools incorporated into the Deliverables that are not specific to Contoso, and Pinnacle may reuse such generalized components for other customers, provided that Pinnacle does not disclose Contoso’s Confidential Information or identify Contoso.

6.3 **License to Pinnacle Tools and Pre‑Existing IP.**  

6.3.1 Solely for the duration of the Extended Term and subject to Contoso’s timely payment of Fees, Pinnacle grants to Contoso a **non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, non‑sublicensable (except to Contoso’s Affiliates)** license to use Pinnacle’s Pre‑Existing IP and generic operational tools embedded in the Deliverables *only as necessary* to receive the benefit of the High‑Risk Program and the Amended Services.  

6.3.2 For the avoidance of doubt, this license is **more limited** than the perpetual license described in **Section 6.3 (License to Pinnacle Pre-Existing IP)** of the MSA and shall **supersede** Section 6.3 solely with respect to tools and Pre‑Existing IP used exclusively in the High‑Risk Program.

6.4 **Third‑Party Materials.**  

The provisions of **Section 6.4 (Third-Party Materials)** of the Master Services Agreement apply. Pinnacle shall identify and obtain licenses for any Third‑Party Materials embedded in the Core Systems support tooling for the High‑Risk Program and shall not introduce Third‑Party Materials that impose more restrictive terms on Contoso than those set out in this Amendment without Contoso’s prior written consent.

6.5 **License to Use Client Data and IP.**  

The license granted in **Section 6.5 (License to Use Client Data and IP)** of the Master Services Agreement applies to the Amended Services. Pinnacle may use Client Data and Contoso‑provided materials solely as necessary to perform the High‑Risk Program and shall not use such data for its own analytics or for any purpose other than providing the Amended Services.

6.6 **Residual Knowledge.**  

The residual knowledge rights described in **Section 6.6 (Residual Knowledge)** of the Master Services Agreement shall apply, provided that Pinnacle’s use of generalized knowledge, skills, and experience gained from the High‑Risk Program shall not (a) disclose Contoso’s Confidential Information, (b) identify Contoso or its clients, or (c) infringe Contoso’s Intellectual Property Rights.

6.7 **Open Source.**  

Use of open source components within any tooling or Deliverables for the High‑Risk Program shall be governed by **Section 6.7 (Open Source)** of the MSA. Pinnacle shall ensure that no open source components are introduced that would require Contoso to distribute source code or subject Contoso’s proprietary code to copyleft obligations without Contoso’s prior written approval.

## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Relationship to MSA Limitations of Liability.**  

The Parties acknowledge the limitations of liability set forth in **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)** of the Master Services Agreement, including **Section 9.1 (Exclusion of Consequential Damages)** and **Section 9.2 (Cap on Direct Damages)**, which reflect a client‑friendly allocation of risk for a Low‑risk engagement.

9.2 **Modified Liability Regime for High‑Risk Program.**  

Given the **High** risk level of the High‑Risk Program and the nature of the Amended Services, the Parties agree that **Article IX of the Master Services Agreement shall not apply to the Amended Services**, and the following liability regime shall apply instead:

  (a) **No Cap on Liability.** There shall be **no contractual cap** on either Party’s aggregate liability arising out of or relating to the Amended Services or this Amendment.  

  (b) **Consequential and Indirect Damages.** Contrary to Section 9.1 of the MSA, neither Party shall be excluded from liability for consequential, incidental, special, exemplary, or punitive damages arising from or relating to the Amended Services, provided that such damages are proven and are not speculative.

9.3 **Proportional Responsibility.**  

Each Party’s liability shall be determined in proportion to its relative fault and responsibility for the damages in question, taking into account the Parties’ respective obligations and the risk allocation reflected in this Amendment.

9.4 **No Limitation for Certain Claims.**  

In any event, there shall be no limitation (cap or exclusion) on either Party’s liability arising from: (a) its indemnification obligations under Article VIII of this Amendment; (b) its breach of **Article V (Confidentiality)** or **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)**; or (c) its gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct.

  (a) Uptime between 99.0% and 99.95%: credit equal to **10%** of the monthly Managed Services Fees for the affected service;  

  (b) Uptime between 98.0% and 99.0%: credit equal to **20%** of the monthly Managed Services Fees for the affected service;  

  (c) Uptime below 98.0%: credit equal to **30%** of the monthly Managed Services Fees for the affected service.

Service Level Credits shall be applied as a credit against subsequent invoices and shall not be deemed punitive but are intended as a contractual adjustment for reduced service performance.

12.6 **Chronic SLA Failures.**  

Chronic failure to meet the High‑Risk Uptime Commitment or other critical Service Levels in **three (3) or more months in any rolling six (6) month period** shall constitute a material breach, entitling Contoso to exercise its termination rights for cause under **Section 4.4** of this Amendment and the MSA.
