Zenith shall use commercially reasonable efforts to replace such Assigned Resource with a suitable alternative within ten (10) Business Days (or such other period as the Parties may agree in writing).

  2.5.3 Assigned Resources shall remain employees, contractors, or agents of Zenith (or its approved subcontractors) at all times.

## ARTICLE III – FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Fee Structures.** Fees for the Services shall be set forth in each SOW and may be based on one or more of the following models:

  (b) **Fixed-Fee:** A lump-sum amount for a defined scope of Services and Deliverables;  
  (c) **Milestone-Based:** Fixed amounts payable upon the achievement of specified milestones.

3.2 **Rate Cards.** If applicable, a rate card describing the standard T&M rates for various roles (e.g., Senior Software Engineer, Architect, QA Analyst, Project Manager) shall be attached to an SOW or schedule. Such rates may be adjusted annually upon mutual written agreement but shall not increase by more than a mutually agreed percentage per year unless otherwise specified.

3.3 **Expenses.** Zenith shall be responsible for its normal overhead expenses. Contoso shall reimburse Zenith for pre‑approved, reasonable, and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the Services (e.g., travel, lodging, per diem, specialized tools or licenses). Zenith shall comply with Contoso’s travel and expense policies provided in advance. Reimbursable expenses shall be itemized in the Invoice and accompanied by receipts or other supporting documentation.

3.4 **Invoicing.**

  3.4.1 Zenith shall submit Invoices on a monthly basis in arrears (unless an SOW specifies different invoicing frequency) to the billing address or email designated by Contoso. Each Invoice shall reference this Agreement’s Contract Reference Number AGR-ZEN-202312-239 and the relevant SOW number, and shall include:

  - a description of Services performed;  
  - the names or IDs of Assigned Resources;  
  - the dates and hours worked (for T&M);  
  - any milestone or Deliverable achieved (for fixed-fee or milestone-based billing); and  
  - any approved reimbursable expenses.

3.5 **Payment Terms.** Subject to **Section 3.4.2**, Contoso shall pay the undisputed amounts due under each properly submitted Invoice within **forty-five (45) calendar days** after receipt of such Invoice (**Net 45**). Payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars by wire transfer, ACH, or other mutually agreed method. Zenith shall provide appropriate banking details to Contoso in writing.

3.6 **Late Payment.** Any undisputed amount not paid when due shall accrue interest at the lesser of (a) one percent (1.0%) per month, or (b) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, from the due date until the date of actual payment. The accrual of interest shall not limit Zenith’s other rights or remedies under this Agreement; however, given the low-risk profile and client-friendly nature of this Agreement, Zenith shall not suspend Services for late payment unless any undisputed amounts remain unpaid for more than sixty (60) days after written notice from Zenith.

3.7 **Taxes.** Fees payable under this Agreement are exclusive of all sales, use, value-added, or similar taxes. Contoso shall be responsible for any such taxes (excluding taxes based on Zenith’s net income, property, or employment obligations). If Zenith is required by law to collect or remit any applicable tax on Contoso’s behalf, Zenith shall include such tax in the Invoice and Contoso shall pay it, provided that Zenith supplies appropriate documentation.

3.8 **No Withholding (Except as Required by Law).** Contoso shall not withhold or deduct any amounts from payments due to Zenith, except as required by applicable law or as expressly authorized in this Agreement or an SOW.
