WHEREAS, the SOW is categorized by the Company as **low risk** and accordingly includes **Client‑friendly limitations of liability and balanced commercial terms** in **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)** of the SOW, which provisions were expressly stated to prevail over **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement for SOW‑specific claims pursuant to **Section 2.2(b)** of the Parent Agreement and **Section 16.1** of the SOW;

2.1.1 This Amendment is executed pursuant to, and under the terms of, the **Parent Agreement (CSA-HOR-202406-206 / contract_206)** and the **SOW (SOW-HOR-202406-212 / contract_212)**. It constitutes an amendment and extension to the SOW as permitted under **Section 2.2(b)** of the Parent Agreement and **Article XIII (Change Management)** and **Section 16.3 (Amendments)** of the SOW.

2.1.2 The general categories of Services described in **Section 2.1(a)–(g)** of the Parent Agreement and further instantiated in **Article II** of the SOW apply to this Amendment. The scope below describes additional and modified Services that are part of the same overall Project but are funded and governed under this Amendment.

2.1.3 Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this Amendment reduces or limits the Services, Deliverables, or obligations already set forth in the SOW. Instead, the Amendment Services are additive and complementary.

2.2 **Overview of Amendment Services.**  

The objective of this Amendment is to extend and deepen the **Enterprise Value Acceleration Program** by adding a discrete, medium‑risk set of Services focused on:

- implementing automated KPI dashboards, predictive models, and data quality controls aligned to the Target Operating Model set out in **Section 2.3.2** and Deliverables in **Section 2.5(c)–(e)** of the SOW;
- strengthening program governance and PMO maturity beyond the baseline capabilities in **Section 2.3.3** and Deliverable **2.5(f)** of the SOW, through **Program Governance Enhancements**;

6.2.2 This license includes the right to use the analytics dashboards, KPI definitions, training materials, and governance artifacts created hereunder for internal decision‑making, performance management, and continuous improvement, but does not authorize Contoso to commercialize such Work Product as a product or service offering to third parties.
