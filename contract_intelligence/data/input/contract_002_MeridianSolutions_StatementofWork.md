8.3 **Indemnification Procedures.** The indemnified Party shall:

  (a) promptly notify the indemnifying Party in writing of any Claim for which indemnification is sought (provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the extent materially prejudiced thereby);  
  (b) permit the indemnifying Party to assume sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim, provided that the indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any liability or obligation on the indemnified Party (other than payment of amounts indemnified hereunder) without the indemnified Party’s prior written consent; and  
  (c) provide reasonable cooperation and assistance, at the indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defense and settlement of the Claim.

8.4 **Infringement Mitigation.** In the event any Deliverable or Service is subject to a Claim of infringement or, in Vendor’s reasonable opinion, is likely to become so, Vendor may, at its option and expense, (a) procure for Client the right to continue using the affected Deliverable or Service, (b) replace or modify the Deliverable or Service so that it is non‑infringing while retaining substantially equivalent functionality, or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected portion of the Services and refund to Client any prepaid, unused fees for such portion.

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with the performance of this Agreement.

  (a) the technical and functional impact of the proposed change;

Vendor shall clearly identify such work in its subsequent invoices.

13.5 **No Implied Changes.** The Parties agree that changes to the Services or Deliverables shall not be implied by conduct, email exchanges, or project meetings. Only a written Change Order executed by both Parties may modify the scope, fees, or other key terms of this Agreement.

14.3 **Mediation.** If the Dispute is not resolved through escalation within thirty (30) days, the Parties shall, prior to initiating litigation (except for injunctive relief as provided in Section 14.5), attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through non‑binding mediation conducted in **San Francisco County, California**, administered by JAMS (or another mutually agreed mediation provider), with each Party bearing its own costs and sharing equally the mediator’s fees.

14.4 **Litigation Venue and Governing Law.** If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days of the mediation request, either Party may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties agree that:

  (a) this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **State of California**, without regard to its conflict of law principles; and  
  (b) the state and federal courts located in **San Francisco County, California** shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any Dispute not resolved through mediation, and the Parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
