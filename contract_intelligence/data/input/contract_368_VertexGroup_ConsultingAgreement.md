## ARTICLE XI  
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its processing of Personal Data under this Agreement. To the extent Vertex processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso, Vertex shall act as a “processor” or “service provider” (as such terms are defined in GDPR and CCPA, respectively) and shall process such Personal Data solely as instructed by Contoso and as necessary to perform the Services.

11.2 **Data Processing Instructions.** Contoso shall be responsible for ensuring that its instructions to Vertex regarding the processing of Personal Data comply with Data Protection Laws. Vertex shall promptly inform Contoso if, in Vertex’s opinion, an instruction infringes Data Protection Laws.

11.3 **Security Measures.** Vertex shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, taking into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing and the risks to individuals.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized access to, or unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of, Personal Data processed by Vertex under this Agreement (a **“Data Breach”**), Vertex shall, without undue delay and in any event as soon as reasonably practicable: (a) notify Contoso of the Data Breach; (b) provide Contoso with reasonably available information about the nature and scope of the Data Breach, the affected data, and the steps taken or to be taken to mitigate its effects; and (c) cooperate with Contoso in Contoso’s investigation of the Data Breach and in the fulfillment of any legal or regulatory obligations related thereto. The Parties shall coordinate in good faith any notifications to data subjects or regulatory authorities.

11.5 **Subprocessors.** Vertex may engage subcontractors to process Personal Data on its behalf, provided that Vertex shall impose on such subcontractors data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Article XI and shall remain responsible to Contoso for the subcontractor’s performance.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.** Vertex shall, to the extent reasonably practicable and taking into account the nature of the processing, assist Contoso in responding to requests from individuals to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., access, rectification, deletion, restriction, data portability, and objection), in each case to the extent such requests relate to Personal Data processed by Vertex for Contoso.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vertex shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Contoso’s written request, Vertex shall, at Contoso’s option, delete or return to Contoso all Personal Data in its possession or control, except to the extent Vertex is required by Applicable Law to retain some or all of the Personal Data, in which case Vertex shall continue to protect such Personal Data in accordance with this Agreement.

SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Availability.** To the extent Vertex provides any hosted or managed service components as part of the Services (e.g., project portals, collaboration platforms, or analytics dashboards), Vertex shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make such services available with **99.9% uptime** on a monthly basis, excluding scheduled maintenance and Force Majeure Events.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.** Vertex may perform scheduled maintenance during off-peak hours, and will use reasonable efforts to provide Contoso with at least forty-eight (48) hours’ notice of scheduled maintenance that is expected to cause material downtime.

- Acknowledge receipt of non-critical issues within one (1) Business Day; and  
- Work diligently to resolve issues in a timeframe commensurate with their severity.

12.4 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.** If Vertex fails to meet the uptime commitments or other Service Levels specified in this Article XII or the applicable SOW, Contoso may be entitled to service credits as specified in the SOW.

## ARTICLE XIV  
DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, its interpretation, performance, or breach (a **“Dispute”**), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiations between executives of the Parties. Either Party may initiate such negotiations by providing written notice of the Dispute to the other Party.

14.2 **Escalation.** If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the initial notice under Section 14.1, either Party may escalate the Dispute to senior executives of each Party, who shall meet (in person or by teleconference) and attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute within an additional thirty (30) days.

14.3 **Mediation.** If the Dispute is not resolved through escalation as described in Section 14.2, the Parties shall attempt to resolve the Dispute through non-binding mediation administered by a mutually agreed mediator located in California. The mediation shall be conducted in accordance with the mediation rules of a recognized mediation service provider (e.g., JAMS or AAA). The costs of the mediation shall be shared equally by the Parties, except that each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs.

14.4 **Litigation or Arbitration.** If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days after appointment of the mediator, either Party may pursue its rights and remedies through litigation or, if the Parties mutually agree in writing, binding arbitration.

14.5 **Venue; Governing Law.** This Agreement and all Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **State of California**, without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles. Subject to the above mediation requirement, the Parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in **San Francisco County, California**, and waive any objection to venue or inconvenient forum.

14.6 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction at any time, without the need to post a bond, to protect its Confidential Information or Intellectual Property Rights or to prevent irreparable harm.

15.2 **Excused Performance.** Neither Party shall be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement (other than payment obligations) to the extent such delay or failure is caused by a Force Majeure Event, provided that the affected Party (a) uses commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event and resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable, and (b) provides prompt notice to the other Party describing the Force Majeure Event and its anticipated impact on performance.

15.3 **Prolonged Force Majeure.** If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and materially impairs the ability of a Party to perform its obligations under this Agreement, either Party may terminate the affected SOWs upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other Party.
