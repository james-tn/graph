11.2 **Data Processing.** To the extent Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of Client in connection with the Services, Vendor shall act as a “processor” or “service provider” (as those terms are defined under GDPR and CCPA, respectively), and Client shall be the “controller” or “business.” The Parties shall, if required by law, enter into a separate data processing agreement, the terms of which shall be incorporated herein by reference once executed.

  (a) scheduled maintenance, not to exceed eight (8) hours per month, with at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior notice to Client;

  - **Priority 2 (High):** Significant degradation affecting key features, but Platform remains operational. Target initial response within four (4) hours; work towards resolution during business hours.
