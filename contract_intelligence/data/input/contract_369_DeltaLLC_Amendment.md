9.2 **Liability Cap.**  

9.2.1 Subject to Sections 9.3 and 9.4 below, the **aggregate liability** of each Party to the other Party arising out of or in connection with this Amendment (whether in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, breach of statutory duty, or otherwise) shall be **capped at five (5) times the total fees actually paid or payable by the Client to the Vendor under this Amendment during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim**.

9.3 **Exclusions from Liability Cap.**  

9.3.1 The liability cap in Section 9.2 shall **not apply** to:  
  (a) Death or personal injury caused by a Party’s negligence;
