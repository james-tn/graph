## PREAMBLE

This **Work Order** (this "**Work Order**", "**WO**" or "**WO-PHO-202508-483**") is made and entered into as of **November 22, 2026** (the "**WO Effective Date**"), by and between:

- **Contoso Enterprises**, a [insert state of incorporation/formation] corporation, with its principal place of business at **1200 Contoso Way, Suite 500, Seattle, Washington 98101** (hereinafter referred to as "**Contoso**", the "**Client**" or the "**Company**"); and  

- **Phoenix Industries**, a [insert state of incorporation/formation] corporation, with its principal place of business at **8500 Phoenix Boulevard, Floor 9, Bellevue, Washington 98004** (hereinafter referred to as "**Phoenix**", the "**Vendor**" or the "**Service Provider**").

Contoso and Phoenix are each referred to herein individually as a "**Party**" and collectively as the "**Parties**."

This Work Order is entered into **pursuant to and under** that certain **Statement of Work**, **Contract Reference Number: SOW-PHO-202508-395**, dated **May 08, 2026**, by and between Contoso and Phoenix, which is identified internally by Contoso as **contract_395** (such Statement of Work, together with all exhibits and amendments thereto, the "**Parent SOW**").

This Work Order is expressly **executed pursuant to the Parent SOW dated May 08, 2026 (Ref: SOW-PHO-202508-395, contract_395)** and is subject to all of the terms and conditions thereof, except to the limited extent expressly modified herein in accordance with the amendment mechanisms described in **Article XVI (General Provisions)** of the Parent SOW and **Section 16.4 (Amendments)** of the Master Services Agreement referenced therein.

**This Work Order adds scope to the Statement of Work dated May 08, 2026 (Ref: SOW-PHO-202508-395, contract_395)** by defining additional Services, Deliverables, and Fees related to the ongoing **Contoso Data Analytics Modernization and Managed Support Program** (the "**Project**") described in **Article II (Scope of Services / Work)** of the Parent SOW. This Work Order supplements and refines the Services and Deliverables under **Workstream B (Platform Implementation and Configuration)**, **Workstream C (Data Migration and Integration)**, and **Workstream E (Managed Services & Support)** as set forth in **Section 2.2** of the Parent SOW.

Pursuant to the Parent SOW, which itself is executed under **Master Services Agreement MSA-PHO-202508-344 (contract_344)**, the Parties now desire to enter into this Work Order, identified as **WO-PHO-202508-483**, to establish a **separate, additional scope of work** with an estimated contract value of **US $546,676**, consistent with the fee framework in **Article III (Fees and Payment Terms)** of the Parent SOW.

The Parties acknowledge that while the Parent SOW is designated as a **“Low Risk Classification”** engagement under **Section 1.19** of the Parent SOW, this Work Order introduces a **“Medium” risk** profile due to expanded data migration, near-real-time integration, and enhanced managed service obligations. Accordingly, the risk allocation in this Work Order is **balanced** between the Parties, differing in certain respects from the more Client-favorable approach in **Article IX (Limitation of Liability)** of the Parent SOW, as expressly set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises set forth in this Work Order, the Parent SOW, and the Master Services Agreement, and intending to be legally bound, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

For the avoidance of doubt, the more Client-favorable allocation of ownership for SOW-specific Deliverables under **Section 6.3 of the Parent SOW** (assigning ownership of SOW-specific Deliverables to Contoso) is extended to WO Deliverables under this Work Order, except as otherwise expressly stated herein.
