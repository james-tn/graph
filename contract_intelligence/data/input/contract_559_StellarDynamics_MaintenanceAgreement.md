## ARTICLE IX. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and consistent with **Section 9.1 of the Parent Agreement**, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages (including loss of profits, revenue, data, or business interruption) arising out of or relating to this Maintenance Agreement, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

9.2 **Aggregate Liability Cap.**  
Notwithstanding **Section 9.2 of the Parent Agreement**, with respect solely to claims arising under or in connection with this Maintenance Agreement:

  a. Each Party’s total aggregate liability to the other Party for all claims arising out of or relating to this Maintenance Agreement shall not exceed **one (1) times** the total Maintenance Fees paid by Client to Vendor under this Maintenance Agreement during the **twelve (12) months** preceding the event giving rise to the claim;  

  b. For clarity, this liability cap for Maintenance Services is separate from, and shall not be aggregated with, the liability cap applicable to the Parent Agreement; however, where a claim arises both under the Parent Agreement and under this Maintenance Agreement from the same events, the higher applicable cap (but not both) shall apply.

9.3 **Exceptions.**  
The limitations and exclusions in this **Article IX** shall not apply to:

  a. A Party’s indemnification obligations under **Article VIII** of the Parent Agreement or this Maintenance Agreement;  

  b. Client’s payment obligations with respect to Maintenance Fees;  

  c. A Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under **Article V** hereof and **Article V of the Parent Agreement**; or  

  d. A Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.**  
The Parties acknowledge that the Maintenance Fees and the terms of this Maintenance Agreement reflect the allocation of risk set forth in this **Article IX** and the limitation and exclusion of damages in **Article IX of the Parent Agreement**, and that absent such allocation, the fees and terms would be substantially different.

Upon expiration or termination of this Maintenance Agreement, Vendor’s obligations with respect to Client Data, including data return and deletion, shall be governed by **Section 11.7 (Data Retention and Deletion)** of the Parent Agreement. For clarity, no separate data retention obligation arises solely from this Maintenance Agreement.

12.1 **Uptime Commitment.**
