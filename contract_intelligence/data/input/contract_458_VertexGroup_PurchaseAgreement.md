- Uptime below 98.0%: service credit equal to 20% of the monthly Fee for the affected Service.

Service credits shall be applied to future invoices and shall be the Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the Uptime Commitment, absent Vendor’s willful misconduct or gross negligence.

12.5 **Exclusions.** Service Levels shall not apply to: (a) any issues caused by the Client’s misuse or unauthorized modification of the Services; (b) outages resulting from Client’s network or infrastructure failures; (c) failures of third-party services or products not controlled by the Vendor; or (d) Force Majeure Events.
