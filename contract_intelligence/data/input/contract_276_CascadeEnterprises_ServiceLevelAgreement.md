Support shall be provided during the hours and with the response times set forth in Article XII.

2.1.5 **Security Management.** Cascade shall implement and maintain security controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Services and Client Data, including access controls, encryption (as appropriate), logging and monitoring, vulnerability management, and incident response, consistent with Article XI.

Additional professional services (e.g., major project work, custom integrations) may be ordered through subsequent SOWs.

2.2 **Specific Deliverables.**  
Without limiting the generality of Section 2.1, Cascade shall provide the following Deliverables:

2.2.1 A detailed **Service Implementation Plan**, including timelines, tasks, dependencies, and responsibilities, to be delivered within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date and approved in writing by Contoso.

2.2.3 **Operational Runbooks** covering standard operating procedures, escalation paths, incident handling, and disaster recovery procedures, to be kept up to date and provided to Contoso upon request.

2.3.3 Failure to meet agreed milestones due primarily to Cascade’s acts or omissions shall entitle Contoso to escalated governance review under Section 14.1, but, given the High Risk profile and negotiated allocations of risk, such failure shall not, by itself, constitute a material breach unless (a) Cascade fails to cure within a mutually agreed remediation plan, and (b) such failure substantially impairs Contoso’s use of the Services.

Cascade shall perform the Services:

2.4.1 In a professional and workmanlike manner, using personnel with appropriate skills, training, and experience;
