Each SOW shall be subject to and governed by the terms of this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and an SOW, the SOW shall prevail, but only with respect to the subject matter expressly addressed therein.

### 2.2 Nature of Services

Vendor shall provide Client with a combination of (a) staff augmentation services, whereby Vendor Personnel are assigned to work on-site at Client’s facilities or remotely on Client projects; (b) project-based consulting services, including planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, and transition; and (c) ongoing support and maintenance services, as applicable. Without limitation, the Services may include:

1. **Information Technology and Software Engineering Services**  
   - Design, development, configuration, and customization of software applications.  
   - Integration of third-party systems, APIs, and data sources.

### 2.3 Deliverables

For each SOW, the Parties shall specify the Deliverables to be produced by Vendor. Deliverables may include, but are not limited to:

- Source code, object code, configuration scripts, and deployment artifacts;  
- User guides, technical documentation, and training materials;  
- Operational runbooks and support documentation;  
- Analysis reports, dashboards, and decision-support tools.

Unless otherwise stated in the applicable SOW, Deliverables shall be deemed accepted upon the earlier of (a) Client’s written acceptance; or (b) ten (10) Business Days after delivery, provided Client has not delivered a written notice of material non-conformity specifying in reasonable detail the basis of rejection. If Client timely notifies Vendor of a material non-conformity, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct such non-conformity and resubmit the Deliverable. Acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by Client.

### 2.4 Performance Standards

Vendor shall perform the Services:  

1. In a professional and workmanlike manner, in accordance with generally accepted industry standards for similar professional services;  
2. In material compliance with the specifications, requirements, and Service Levels set forth in this Agreement and any SOW; and  
3. In compliance with Applicable Law and all Client policies that are provided in writing to Vendor and expressly acknowledged by Vendor in an SOW.

Given the High Risk nature of this engagement, the Parties acknowledge that Vendor is undertaking complex and potentially time-sensitive activities. Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the milestones and timelines agreed in each SOW. However, the Parties agree that:  

- Timelines are estimates unless expressly stated as “Firm Milestones” in the SOW;  
- Client shall provide timely feedback, approvals, and access to resources as reasonably required for Vendor to perform the Services; and  
- Delays caused by Client or its agents, or by Force Majeure Events (as defined in Article XV), shall entitle Vendor to schedule extensions and, where applicable, additional compensation under Article XIII (Change Management).

### 2.5 Client Responsibilities

Client acknowledges and agrees that Vendor’s ability to perform the Services and meet milestones is dependent upon Client’s timely performance of its obligations, including, without limitation:

1. Providing Vendor with access to Client’s facilities, systems, personnel, and data as reasonably necessary;  
2. Designating a project manager or primary point of contact with decision-making authority;  
3. Reviewing and providing feedback on Deliverables in a timely manner;  
4. Making timely payments in accordance with Article III (Fees and Payment Terms).

Any failure by Client to perform its obligations may result in delays, additional costs, and other impacts. Vendor shall not be liable for any failure to meet milestones or Service Levels to the extent resulting from Client’s failure to perform its obligations.

### 2.6 Subcontractors

Vendor may, in its sole discretion, use subcontractors or Affiliates to perform all or part of the Services, provided that Vendor shall remain responsible for the performance of such subcontractors and Affiliates as if they were Vendor Personnel. Vendor shall ensure that any subcontractors or Affiliates performing Services are bound by confidentiality and data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement.

### 2.7 Changes to Scope

Any modification to the scope, Deliverables, timeline, or fees for the Services shall be governed by Article XIII (Change Management). No oral statements or informal communications relating to scope changes shall be binding unless memorialized in a written Change Order executed by both Parties.

### 3.4 Late Payment; Suspension

If Client fails to pay any undisputed amounts when due:

If Vendor is required to collect and remit any such taxes, Vendor shall itemize such taxes on the applicable invoice, and Client shall remit payment accordingly.

### 3.7 Expenses

Subject to any limitations set forth in an SOW, Client shall reimburse Vendor for reasonable, actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing the Services, including travel, lodging, meals, and other necessary expenses, provided that:

1. Vendor complies with Client’s written travel and expense policies provided in advance; and
