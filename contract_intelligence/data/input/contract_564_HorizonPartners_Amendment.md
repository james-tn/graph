Except as expressly modified herein, such provisions remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and confirmed.

2.2 **Premises and Use Unchanged.** The Premises, as defined in Section 1.1.12 of the Parent Agreement (Suite 1010, approximately 4,500 rentable square feet at One Horizon Center), and the **Permitted Use** set forth in **Section 2.2** (general office, administrative, and related lawful commercial purposes), shall remain unchanged by this Amendment. Tenant’s use shall continue to adhere to all Applicable Laws and Building Rules and Regulations.

2.3 **Extension and Continuity of Services.** Landlord agrees that all **Landlord’s Services** described in **Section 2.3 (Landlord’s Services)** of the Parent Agreement (including HVAC, electricity and utilities, janitorial services, security and access, elevator service, and repairs and maintenance of Building Systems) shall continue throughout the Extended Term and shall be performed in accordance with the Parent Agreement as modified by this Amendment.

2.4 **Enhanced Landlord Services.** Effective as of the Amendment Effective Date and continuing throughout the Extended Term (and any Renewal Term exercised thereafter, if applicable), Landlord shall implement **Enhanced Landlord Services** as follows:

2.4.1 **HVAC Enhancements.**  
(a) During Business Hours (as defined in Section 1.1.17 of the Parent Agreement), Landlord shall maintain HVAC performance consistent with first-class office standards in New York City, but will also implement improved monitoring and control systems to respond more quickly to temperature variance complaints from Tenant.

The cost of such extended-hours HVAC shall be treated as **Additional Rent** under Section 3.2 of the Parent Agreement and billed in accordance with **Amended Payment Terms**.

2.4.2 **Security and Access Enhancements.**  
(a) In addition to **Section 2.3.4 (Security and Access)** of the Parent Agreement, Landlord shall implement enhanced access control measures to the floor on which the Premises is located, including upgraded card-access controls and expanded CCTV coverage in corridors immediately adjacent to the Premises.  
(b) Tenant shall continue to have twenty-four (24) hour access to the Premises, subject to security protocols and Force Majeure Events, as described in the Parent Agreement.

3.3 **Amended Payment Terms – Net 45.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in **Section 3.4 (Payment Terms; Method of Payment)** and **Section 1.1.19 (Payment Terms)** of the Parent Agreement, all amounts of Base Rent, Additional Rent, and other sums payable by Tenant under the Lease as amended shall be due and payable **Net 45** days from the date of Landlord’s invoice, except that recurring monthly Base Rent invoices shall be deemed issued on the first (1st) day of each calendar month during the Term and shall be due within forty-five (45) days thereafter.

3.4 **Late Payments; Interest; Administrative Fees.** **Section 3.5 (Late Payments; Interest)** of the Parent Agreement is hereby amended and restated as follows for all amounts due after the Amendment Effective Date:

3.4.1 Any amount due and not paid within **five (5) days** after the applicable Net 45 due date shall accrue interest at the lesser of (a) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, compounded monthly, or (b) the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law, from the original due date until paid in full.

3.4.2 In addition to interest, Landlord may assess a late payment fee equal to **seven and one-half percent (7.5%)** of the overdue amount to cover Landlord’s administrative and collection costs. Such fee shall constitute Additional Rent.

3.4.3 Repeated late payments (more than two (2) occurrences in any rolling twelve (12)-month period) shall constitute a material breach and may be treated as an event of default under **Section 4.4.1(a)** of the Parent Agreement (non-payment of Rent), subject to applicable notice and cure periods.

3.5 **Expenses and Reimbursements.** **Section 3.7 (Expenses and Reimbursements)** of the Parent Agreement remains in force, and Tenant acknowledges that:

3.5.1 All incremental costs associated with Enhanced Landlord Services (e.g., extended-hours HVAC, enhanced security, additional janitorial services beyond standard building services) shall be reimbursed by Tenant as Additional Rent, subject to reasonable documentation; and

3.5.2 Landlord may apply an administrative surcharge of up to **fifteen percent (15%)** on such incremental costs, as expressly authorized by Section 3.7 of the Parent Agreement.

3.7 **Security Deposit.** If Landlord previously required a Security Deposit pursuant to **Section 3.6** of the Parent Agreement, Landlord may, upon written notice to Tenant, require that such Security Deposit be increased to an amount equal to **two (2) months’ then-current Base Rent** at any time during the Extended Term, to reflect increased exposure and high-risk classification. Tenant shall fund any such increase within thirty (30) days of notice.

3.8 **Taxes on Rent.** Tenant’s obligations under **Section 3.8 (Taxes on Rent; Withholding)** of the Parent Agreement remain in full force and effect and shall apply to all Rent and other amounts payable during the Extended Term.

---

## ARTICLE IV  
TERM AND TERMINATION (AS AMENDED)

4.1 **Revised Term and Expiration.** Section 1.1.10 (“Lease Term” or “Term”) and **Section 4.1 (Term)** of the Parent Agreement are hereby amended such that the Term of the Lease shall now commence on the Commencement Date (December 1, 2025) and continue until the **Revised Expiration Date of March 31, 2030**, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the Lease as amended.

4.2 **Renewal Options – Clarification and Modification.** Section 4.2 (Renewal Options) of the Parent Agreement is modified as follows:

4.2.1 Tenant shall continue to have one (1) option to renew the Lease for an additional term of three (3) years (the “Renewal Term”), exercisable by written notice to Landlord not less than nine (9) months prior to the **Revised Expiration Date** (i.e., by no later than **June 30, 2029**).

4.2.2 The market-rate determination process for Renewal Term Base Rent as provided in Section 4.2 of the Parent Agreement remains unchanged; provided, however, that Landlord’s determination shall be given **prima facie** weight, and Tenant shall bear the burden of demonstrating that such determination is inconsistent with then-prevailing market rates for comparable space in the Building.

4.3 **Termination for Convenience.** Section 4.3 of the Parent Agreement is hereby amended as follows:

4.3.1 **By Tenant.** Tenant may terminate the Lease for convenience only upon not less than **one hundred eighty (180) days’** prior written notice to Landlord (replacing the original sixty (60) days’ notice), provided that (a) Tenant is not in material default as of the proposed termination date, and (b) Tenant pays all amounts due and owing through the effective date of termination. Landlord may require Tenant to pay an early termination fee equal to **six (6) months’ then-current Base Rent** (increased from up to three (3) months) as a condition to the effectiveness of such termination, plus reimbursement of any unamortized leasing commissions and Tenant improvement allowances, if any, to the extent actually incurred by Landlord.

4.3.2 **By Landlord.** Landlord’s termination for convenience rights under Section 4.3.2 of the Parent Agreement shall remain intact; however, the Parties acknowledge that Landlord may also terminate the Lease for convenience in the event of a sale or refinancing of the Building which, in Landlord’s reasonable business judgment, materially benefits from or requires Tenant’s relocation. In such event, Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to provide Tenant with comparable alternative space in the Building or another property under Landlord’s control, if available, on commercially reasonable terms.

4.4 **Termination for Cause.** **Section 4.4 (Termination for Cause)** of the Parent Agreement remains in full force and effect. For avoidance of doubt:

4.4.1 A failure by Tenant to comply with the Amended Payment Terms or to fund any required Security Deposit increase shall be treated as a failure to pay Rent under **Section 4.4.1(a)** of the Parent Agreement.

4.4.2 Any willful or repeated violation of Building Rules and Regulations that materially impacts building operations or safety shall constitute a material breach under **Section 4.4.1(b)** of the Parent Agreement.

4.5 **Effect of Termination of Parent Agreement on Amendment.** This Amendment is an integral part of the Lease. If the Parent Agreement is lawfully terminated or expires without renewal, this Amendment shall automatically terminate concurrently therewith, and no independent rights shall survive except those that expressly survive termination under the Parent Agreement or this Amendment (e.g., confidentiality, indemnification, accrued payment obligations).

4.6 **Survival.** The provisions of the Parent Agreement that by their nature are intended to survive termination (including **Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XIV, XV, and XVI**) shall continue to survive, and all corresponding provisions in this Amendment (especially those contained in Articles V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XIV, XV, and XVI below) shall survive for the periods specified herein.

## ARTICLE V  
CONFIDENTIALITY (SUPPLEMENTAL)

5.1 **Relationship to Parent Agreement.** The confidentiality obligations set forth in **Article V (Confidentiality)** of the Parent Agreement remain in full force and effect. This **Article V** of the Amendment supplements and clarifies such obligations.

5.3.2 Not disseminate or permit disclosure of any building security protocols or access control procedures to anyone other than Tenant’s employees and authorized contractors who have a need to know such information.

5.4 **Survival Period.** The confidentiality obligations of the Parties under the Parent Agreement and this Amendment shall survive for a period of **five (5) years** following the Revised Expiration Date or earlier termination of the Lease, except that trade secrets and security-sensitive information shall be kept confidential for as long as they remain protected under Applicable Law or as long as such information remains materially sensitive from a security perspective, whichever is later.

## ARTICLE VI  
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (SUPPLEMENTAL)

6.1 **Confirming Landlord IP Ownership.** The Parties reaffirm the provisions of **Article VI (Intellectual Property Rights)** of the Parent Agreement.

6.2 **Expanded License to Tenant.** The limited license granted to Tenant under Section 6.2.1 of the Parent Agreement is hereby expanded to include any additional software portals, security systems, and facility-management platforms implemented as part of the Enhanced Landlord Services; such license remains non-exclusive, non-transferable, and limited to Tenant’s use of the Premises and Building Services during the Term.
