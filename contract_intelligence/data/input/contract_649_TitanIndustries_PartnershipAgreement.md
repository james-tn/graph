To the extent any Titan Materials are embedded in the Deliverables, Titan hereby grants to Contoso a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as permitted under Section 16.7), non-sublicensable license to use such Titan Materials solely as incorporated into the Deliverables, and solely for Contoso’s internal business purposes, during the Term.

Titan shall obtain appropriate rights to use such Third-Party Materials for the benefit of Contoso as reasonably necessary for use of the Deliverables in accordance with this Agreement. Third-Party Materials shall be subject to their own license terms, which Titan shall make available to Contoso upon request. Contoso agrees to comply with any such third-party terms.

6.7 **Residual Knowledge.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Titan shall be free to use its general knowledge, skills, and experience, and any ideas, concepts, know-how, and techniques that are acquired or used in the course of providing the Services, on an unrestricted basis for any purpose, provided that Titan does not disclose Contoso’s Confidential Information in violation of Article V.

6.8 **Infringement Claims.** If any Deliverable, as provided by Titan, is finally adjudicated to infringe the Intellectual Property Rights of a third party, Titan may, at its option and expense: (a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using the Deliverable; (b) modify the Deliverable so that it becomes non-infringing without materially reducing its functionality; or (c) replace the Deliverable with a non-infringing alternative that materially preserves its functionality. If Titan determines that none of the foregoing options is commercially reasonable, Titan may terminate the affected portion of the Services and refund to Contoso any prepaid amounts for the affected Deliverable less a reasonable allowance for use.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.** In the event of any Dispute, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the matter informally. Either Party may initiate negotiations by providing written notice to the other Party describing the Dispute. Within ten (10) Business Days of such notice, the Parties’ respective project managers shall meet (in person or via teleconference) to attempt to resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute is not resolved within fifteen (15) Business Days thereafter, the Dispute shall be escalated to senior management of each Party.

The Parties shall share equally the mediator’s fees and expenses.

14.3 **Arbitration / Litigation Venue.** If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation or mediation as provided above, either Party may pursue legal remedies. Unless the Parties mutually agree to binding arbitration, any suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in **Dallas County, Texas**, and each Party irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

14.4 **Continued Performance.** During the pendency of any Dispute, Titan shall continue to perform the Services, and Contoso shall continue to pay any undisputed amounts due, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article IV.

14.5 **Injunctive Relief.** Nothing in this Article XIV shall prevent either Party from seeking immediate injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm, including with respect to breaches of confidentiality or misuse of Intellectual Property Rights.
