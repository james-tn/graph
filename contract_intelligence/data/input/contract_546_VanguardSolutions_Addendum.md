  (a) The general scope of Services described in **Section 2.1 (General Scope)** of the Parent Agreement—namely provision of a secure, cloud-based SaaS platform, hosting, storage, backup, integration, support, and professional services—continues to apply, and this Addendum adds new modules, features, and data-processing use cases.

  (b) Pursuant to **Section 2.2 of the Parent Agreement**, the categories of data subjects, types of Personal Data, purposes, and duration of processing are supplemented and expanded as set out in **Annex A (Processing Description Annex)** to this Addendum.

  - continuous behavioral profiling based on interaction logs and telemetry;  
  - anomaly and fraud detection across multiple systems and jurisdictions; and  
  - predictive modeling for operational and compliance risk indicators.

  This Enhanced Analytics Processing will involve the ingestion and Processing of Extended Data Sets including, where authorized, geolocation data, device fingerprints, transaction metadata, and behavioral event logs tied to pseudonymized identifiers.

  (b) **Cross-Platform Data Aggregation.** Vendor will implement and maintain integrations with additional Company and third-party systems, beyond those contemplated in the initial implementation under the Parent Agreement, including but not limited to enterprise ERP, CRM, and payment gateways.

2.4 **Performance Standards and Service Levels.**  

  (a) Vendor shall perform the Additional Services in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with **Section 2.4 of the Parent Agreement**. Given the high-risk nature of the processing, Vendor shall, where commercially reasonable, implement heightened operational controls and monitoring mechanisms.
