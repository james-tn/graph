9.2 **Exceptions and Survival.** The exceptions in Section 9.1 of the Master Agreement regarding indemnification, confidentiality, data protection, and gross negligence/willful misconduct remain applicable. All limitations and exceptions herein shall survive expiration or termination of this Work Order.
