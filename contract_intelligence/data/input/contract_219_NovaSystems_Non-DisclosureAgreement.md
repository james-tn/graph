## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute through negotiations between senior executives of each Party.

If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute through negotiations within thirty (30) days of initiation of negotiations, either Party may request that the dispute be submitted to non-binding mediation.

The Parties shall share the mediator’s fees equally and shall bear their own legal and other costs.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  
If the dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days after mediation is initiated, then, unless otherwise mutually agreed:

  - Alternatively, either Party may bring an action in the **state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California**, and the Parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

The choice between arbitration or litigation may be specified in the applicable SOW or agreed in writing at the time the dispute arises.
