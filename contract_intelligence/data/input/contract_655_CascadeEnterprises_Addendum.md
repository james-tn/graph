To the maximum extent permitted by law, and consistent with **Section 9.1** of the Parent Agreement, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill, arising out of or relating to this Addendum, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.
