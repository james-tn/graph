## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.** The Parties acknowledge that, in relation to Client Data that constitutes personal data under Data Protection Laws, Client is the “data controller” (or equivalent term under Applicable Law) and Vendor is the “data processor” (or equivalent). The Parties shall comply with their respective obligations under Applicable Law.

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.** Vendor shall process Client Data only: (a) in accordance with Client’s documented instructions as set out in this Agreement and the relevant SOWs; and (b) as necessary to perform the Services. Vendor shall not “sell” or “share” personal data (as those terms are defined under CCPA) or otherwise process Client Data for its own purposes, except as permitted under this Agreement (e.g., for internal analytics or service improvement in anonymized or aggregated form).

11.3 **Security Measures.** Vendor shall implement and maintain technical and organizational measures appropriate to the risk, including but not limited to:

  11.3.1 Access controls, authentication, and authorization mechanisms;

  11.3.2 Encryption of personal data in transit over public networks and at rest where commercially reasonable;

  11.3.3 Regular vulnerability management, patching, and security monitoring;

  11.3.4 Logical separation of Client Data from other customers’ data; and

  11.3.5 Regular security awareness training for Vendor personnel with access to Client Data.

11.4 **Subprocessors.** Vendor may engage subprocessors to process Client Data in connection with the Services, provided that:

  11.4.1 Vendor enters into a written agreement with each subprocessor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those contained in this Article XI; and

  11.4.2 Vendor remains fully liable for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors to the same extent as for its own acts and omissions.

Upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall provide a current list of subprocessors materially involved in the processing of Client Data.

11.5 **Cross-Border Transfers.** To the extent Vendor transfers Client Data outside the jurisdiction in which it was originally collected (e.g., from the EU to non-EU countries), Vendor shall ensure that such transfers comply with Data Protection Laws, including through the use of appropriate transfer mechanisms such as standard contractual clauses or other approved safeguards.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights and Assistance.** Vendor shall, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Vendor, assist Client in fulfilling its obligations to respond to requests from data subjects (e.g., access, correction, deletion, restriction, portability) and to comply with data protection impact assessments and consultation obligations with supervisory authorities, to the extent required by Data Protection Laws. Vendor may charge Client on a time-and-materials basis for such assistance, where legally permissible.

11.7 **Data Breach Notification.**  

  11.7.1 In the event of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized access, acquisition, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of Client Data or any security incident that materially compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of Client Data (a **“Data Breach”**), Vendor shall, without undue delay and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours of becoming aware of the Data Breach, notify Client in writing, providing details to the extent known, including:
  - Nature of the Data Breach, including categories and approximate number of data subjects and records affected;  
  - Likely consequences of the Data Breach; and  
  - Measures taken or proposed to address the Data Breach and mitigate its possible adverse effects.

  11.7.2 Vendor shall promptly investigate the Data Breach, take appropriate remedial actions, and cooperate with Client in fulfilling any legal obligations, including notifications to data subjects or authorities. Vendor’s notice of a Data Breach shall not be construed as an admission of fault or liability.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Client’s written request, Vendor shall, at Client’s option, either (a) return all Client Data (in a commonly used electronic format) to Client, or (b) securely delete or anonymize Client Data in Vendor’s possession or control, except to the extent Vendor is required to retain such data under Applicable Law or for legitimate business purposes (e.g., legal, accounting, or audit requirements). Any retained Client Data shall remain subject to the confidentiality and data protection obligations herein.

11.9 **Audit Rights.** Upon reasonable prior written notice and no more than once per twelve (12) month period (unless required by a supervisory authority or in the event of a confirmed Data Breach), Client may conduct, or appoint an independent third party to conduct, a security and data protection audit of Vendor’s relevant facilities, systems, and records solely as they relate to Client Data, provided that:

  11.9.1 Such audit shall be conducted during normal business hours, without unreasonable disruption to Vendor’s operations;

  11.9.2 Client and its auditors shall be bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective than those set forth herein; and

  11.9.3 Client shall bear all costs and expenses of such audit, and Vendor may charge reasonable fees for its assistance and time.

  12.4.2 Be applied against future Fees payable by Client for the affected services; and

  12.4.3 Not be redeemable for cash refunds.

12.5 **Exclusions.** Service Levels shall not apply to any beta, trial, or non-production environments, or to any issues arising from Client’s failure to comply with Vendor’s specifications, instructions, or reasonable recommendations.
