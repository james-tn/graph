11.1 **Compliance with Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, including, as applicable, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and any successor or related legislation, as well as other laws applicable to the processing of Personal Data under this Agreement.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  
(a) To the extent that Epsilon processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso in the course of providing the Services, Contoso shall be deemed the “data controller” (or analogous term under applicable law) and Epsilon shall be deemed the “data processor” (or analogous term).  
(b) The Parties shall execute any additional data processing agreement or addendum reasonably required under applicable law, which shall be incorporated into this Agreement.

11.3 **Epsilon Obligations as Processor.** To the extent Epsilon processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso, Epsilon shall:  
(a) Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso (including this Agreement), except where required by applicable law;  
(b) Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access;  
(c) Ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data are bound by confidentiality obligations;

## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)

12.1 **Uptime Commitment.** Epsilon shall ensure that critical Leased Assets (as identified in applicable SOWs) achieve a minimum monthly availability (uptime) of **99.9%**, measured on a 24x7 basis, excluding scheduled maintenance and Force Majeure Events as defined in Article XV.

12.2 **Response and Resolution Times.** Epsilon shall respond to and address service incidents in accordance with the following targets (unless otherwise specified in an SOW):

12.3 **Service Credits.**  
(a) If Epsilon fails to meet the uptime or response time commitments set forth in this Article XII during a given calendar month, Contoso shall be entitled to service credits as specified in the applicable SOW or, in the absence of such specification, as follows:  
- Availability between 99.0% and 99.9%: 3% credit on monthly Fees for affected Leased Assets.

- Availability below 98.0%: 10% credit on monthly Fees for affected Leased Assets.  
(b) Service credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall not entitle Contoso to a refund in cash, except upon termination of this Agreement when no further invoices remain, in which case credits may be refunded at Epsilon’s discretion or applied to other outstanding amounts.

12.4 **Exclusions from SLA Calculations.** The following shall be excluded from uptime and SLA calculations:  
(a) Scheduled maintenance with at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior notice and not exceeding agreed maintenance windows;

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may request changes to the scope of Services, Leased Assets, Service Levels, or other material aspects of this Agreement or any SOW (each, a “Change Request”). Change Requests shall be made in writing and shall describe the proposed change, rationale, and anticipated impact.

13.2 **Evaluation and Approval.**  
(a) Upon receiving a Change Request, the receiving Party shall promptly evaluate the request and, where the Change Request is initiated by Contoso, Epsilon shall provide an estimate of any impact on Fees, timelines, resource requirements, and Service Levels.  
(b) No Change Request shall be effective unless documented in a written change order or amended SOW signed by authorized representatives of both Parties.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Internal Escalation.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (“Dispute”), the Parties shall first attempt to resolve it through good-faith negotiations between their respective project managers or primary points of contact. If such individuals are unable to resolve the Dispute within ten (10) Business Days, the Dispute shall be escalated to senior management representatives of each Party for further good-faith negotiation.

14.2 **Mediation.** If the Dispute is not resolved through internal escalation within thirty (30) days, either Party may request non-binding mediation. The Parties shall jointly select a mutually acceptable mediator and shall share the mediator’s fees equally. Mediation shall take place in a location mutually agreed upon or virtually.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.**  
Given the Governing Law of Delaware and the nature of the Parties’ relationship, the Parties agree that:  
(a) Any Dispute not resolved through negotiation or mediation as described above shall be finally resolved by **binding arbitration** administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced.  
(b) The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator experienced in commercial and technology-related disputes. The place of arbitration shall be **Wilmington, Delaware**, unless otherwise agreed.  
(c) The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages consistent with the limitations in Article IX but shall have no authority to award punitive or exemplary damages.  
(d) Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

14.4 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information or Intellectual Property rights, without first resorting to mediation or arbitration.

14.5 **Continued Performance.** During the pendency of any Dispute, the Parties shall continue to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement to the extent reasonably practicable, unless and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article IV.

16.2 **Amendments.** No amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Email communications alone shall not constitute a valid amendment unless they clearly indicate an intent to amend and are confirmed by formal written execution.

16.3 **Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect, and the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid, enforceable provision that achieves, to the greatest extent possible, the original economic and legal intent.

16.4 **Waiver.** The failure of either Party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or limitation of that Party’s right to subsequently enforce and compel strict compliance with every provision of this Agreement. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by the waiving Party.

16.5 **Notices.**  
(a) All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, and other communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given: (i) when delivered personally; (ii) when sent by email with confirmation of transmission, provided that a copy is also sent by another method below; (iii) three (3) Business Days after being sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; or (iv) one (1) Business Day after being sent by nationally recognized overnight courier.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may assign this Agreement without consent to an Affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, provided that the assignee assumes all obligations under this Agreement in writing.
