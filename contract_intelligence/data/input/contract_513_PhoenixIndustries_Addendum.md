  (b) Service credits shall be calculated as a percentage of the **monthly Enhanced Managed Services Fees** for the affected month, as follows:  

   - Uptime between **99.0% and 99.9%**: **5% credit**  
   - Uptime between **98.0% and 99.0%**: **10% credit**  
   - Uptime below **98.0%**: **20% credit**  

  (c) In addition, repeated failure to meet response/resolution targets for Priority 1 incidents (more than three (3) instances in any rolling three-month period) will result in an additional **5% credit** for the affected month.
