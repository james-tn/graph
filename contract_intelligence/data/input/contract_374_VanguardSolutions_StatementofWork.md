  b. Permit the indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of the claim, provided that the indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim without the indemnified Party’s prior written consent if such settlement (i) imposes any obligation on the indemnified Party other than payment of amounts indemnified hereunder, or (ii) does not include a full and unconditional release of the indemnified Party; and
