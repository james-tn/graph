12.1 **Service Availability (Uptime).**  
12.1.1 The Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the production environment for the Client’s hosted applications and infrastructure is available at least **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and Excused Downtime as defined below.  

12.1.2 “Scheduled Maintenance” means planned maintenance activities that may result in temporary unavailability of the Services, for which the Vendor shall provide the Client with at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior notice.
