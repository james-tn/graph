Confidential Information includes, without limitation: business plans, financial data, product roadmaps, customer lists, pricing, marketing plans, technical data, system designs, security information, trade secrets, and any Personal Data or Client Data.

  (a) use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information solely for the purpose of performing or receiving the Services, or otherwise exercising its rights or fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement;  
  (b) not disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any third party except as expressly permitted herein; and

  (b) to the extent required by Applicable Law or by a valid order of a court or other governmental authority, provided that, to the extent legally permitted, the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prompt written notice of such requirement and cooperates reasonably with the Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Party’s expense, in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy.

5.4 **Return or Destruction.**  
Upon written request of the Disclosing Party or upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy (at the Disclosing Party’s election) all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in its possession or control, including all copies, except that the Receiving Party may retain: (a) one (1) archival copy solely for legal, regulatory, or compliance purposes; and (b) any copies that are maintained as part of routine electronic backup systems, provided such retained copies remain subject to the confidentiality obligations herein.

5.7 **Survival.**  
The obligations set forth in this Article V shall commence on the Effective Date and shall survive for a period of **five (5) years** following expiration or termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that trade secrets shall be protected for so long as they remain trade secrets under Applicable Law.
