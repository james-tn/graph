8.1.1 Meridian shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Contoso, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, “**Contoso Indemnified Parties**”) from and against any and all third‑party claims, actions, suits, proceedings, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) (collectively, “**Claims**”) arising out of or relating to:

(a) any allegation that the Deliverables or Meridian’s performance of the Services infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property right of a third party;

(c) Meridian’s material breach of this Agreement.

### 8.3 Indemnification Procedures  

8.3.1 The indemnified Party shall:

(a) promptly notify the indemnifying Party in writing of any Claim for which indemnification is sought (failure to provide such notice shall only relieve the indemnifying Party of its obligations to the extent it is materially prejudiced thereby);  
(b) provide the indemnifying Party with reasonable cooperation and assistance, at the indemnifying Party’s expense; and  
(c) grant the indemnifying Party sole control over the defense and settlement of the Claim, provided that the indemnifying Party may not settle any Claim that imposes any liability or obligation on the indemnified Party without the indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

8.3.2 The indemnified Party may participate in the defense of any Claim with counsel of its choosing, at its own expense.

### 8.4 Infringement Remedies  

8.4.1 If any Deliverable or Service is, or in Meridian’s reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement Claim, Meridian may, at its option and expense:

(a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using the Deliverable or Service;  
(b) replace or modify the Deliverable or Service to make it non‑infringing, provided that the replacement or modification does not materially diminish the overall functionality; or  
(c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected Deliverable or Service and refund to Contoso the Fees paid for the affected Deliverable or Service, on a pro‑rata basis.

8.4.2 This **Section 8.4** sets forth Meridian’s sole and exclusive obligations, and Contoso’s exclusive remedies, with respect to any infringement or misappropriation of Intellectual Property rights.
