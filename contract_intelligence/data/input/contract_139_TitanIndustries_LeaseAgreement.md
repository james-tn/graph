DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its performance under this Agreement.

SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Availability of Premises and Building Systems.** Titan shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Premises and critical building systems (e.g., electricity, HVAC, access control) are available **99.9%** of the time during any given calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance and Force Majeure Events.

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.** Titan shall provide Contoso with at least five (5) Business Days’ notice of any scheduled maintenance that may materially affect access to or use of the Premises or critical systems. Titan shall conduct such maintenance during off-peak hours where reasonably practicable.

  a. **Critical Incidents** (health/safety issues, complete loss of power, or building inaccessibility): response within **2 hours**, remediation commenced within **4 hours**;  
  b. **High Priority** (partial loss of critical services, significant water leaks, HVAC outages in large areas): response within **4 hours**, remediation commenced within **24 hours**;  
  c. **Standard Requests** (non-critical repairs, cosmetic issues): response within **1 Business Day**, remediation within **5 Business Days**, where reasonably feasible.

12.4 **SLA Credits.** If Titan fails to meet the availability target in Section 12.1 in any calendar month (excluding Force Majeure Events and Contoso-caused outages), Contoso shall be entitled, upon written request within sixty (60) days, to a credit against the next monthly Rent, calculated as follows:

  a. Availability between 99.0% and 99.9%: 2% of that month’s Base Rent;  
  b. Availability between 98.0% and 99.0%: 5% of that month’s Base Rent;

CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may request changes to the Premises, Services, or Service Levels by submitting a written change request describing the proposed change, rationale, and any required timelines.

## ARTICLE XIV  
DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Negotiation and Escalation.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (a “**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through negotiations between senior executives. Either Party may initiate such process by providing written notice to the other Party describing the Dispute. The Parties shall meet (in person or via teleconference) within fifteen (15) Business Days of such notice.

14.2 **Mediation.** If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through negotiation within thirty (30) days after initiation, either Party may request non-binding mediation. The Parties shall jointly select a mediator experienced in commercial lease disputes in California. Mediation shall occur in **San Francisco County, California**, unless otherwise agreed, and costs shall be shared equally.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.** If mediation does not resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after appointment of the mediator, either Party may pursue binding resolution as follows:

  a. **Arbitration Option.** Upon mutual written agreement, the Dispute shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, by a single arbitrator, in San Francisco County, California.  
  b. **Litigation.** In the absence of mutual agreement to arbitrate, either Party may bring an action in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

Contoso’s obligation to pay Rent shall continue, except to the extent the Premises are rendered wholly unusable for more than thirty (30) consecutive days due to a Force Majeure Event affecting the Premises, in which case the Rent shall be equitably abated for the period of such unusability.

15.4 **Extended Force Majeure.** If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than one hundred twenty (120) consecutive days and materially impairs Contoso’s use of the Premises, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice.
