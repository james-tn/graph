3.2.3 **Contingency / Success-Based Fees (Optional).** If the Parties agree to success‑based or performance‑linked fees associated with, for example, analytic‑driven cost savings or revenue uplift, such fees shall be documented in a Change Order or attached schedule. Any such amounts will count toward the Amendment Contract Value unless expressly agreed otherwise.

3.3 **Payment Terms – Net 30 (Modification of Parent SOW for Amendment).**  
Notwithstanding the **Net 45** payment terms set forth in **Section 1.17** and **Section 3.3** of the Parent SOW, the Parties agree that for **this Amendment only**:

3.4 **Expenses and Reimbursement.**  
The expense reimbursement provisions of **Section 3.6 (Expenses and Reimbursement)** of the Parent SOW and **Section 3.5 of the Consulting Agreement** apply to this Amendment, subject to the following clarifications:

3.5 **Late Payment; Suspension Rights.**  
Late payment and suspension rights under **Section 3.5 of the Parent SOW** and **Section 3.3 of the Consulting Agreement** apply to Amendment Invoices. Acme may suspend performance of Amendment Services if Contoso fails to pay undisputed amounts within the Net 30 period, after providing written notice and a cure period consistent with such provisions.

3.6 **Taxes.**  
All Fees under this Amendment are exclusive of Taxes, which shall be handled in accordance with **Section 3.7 (Taxes)** of the Parent SOW and **Section 3.6 of the Consulting Agreement**.
