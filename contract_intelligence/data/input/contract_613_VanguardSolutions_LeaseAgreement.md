To the extent either Party processes personal data of the other Party’s staff, visitors, or other individuals (e.g., CCTV footage, access logs, visitor records):

  (a) Each Party shall act as an independent controller (as defined under Data Protection Laws) with respect to personal data it collects and processes for its own purposes;

  (b) planned maintenance is scheduled, where reasonably possible, outside Working Hours; and  

  (c) Vendor uses reasonable endeavours to minimize disruption to Client’s operations.

Any agreed changes:

  (a) may result in adjustments to Rent, Service Charges, and other fees, which shall be clearly set out in the Change Order;

  (c) shall not relieve either Party from its existing obligations under this Agreement unless explicitly stated in the Change Order.

13.4 **Minor Operational Changes.**  
Vendor may implement minor operational changes (such as adjustments to cleaning schedules or security patrol routes) without a formal Change Order, provided such changes do not materially adversely affect Client’s use of the Premises or increase Client’s fees. Vendor shall notify Client of such changes as appropriate.

## ARTICLE XIV  
DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.**  
In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (a **“Dispute”**), the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the Dispute through good faith negotiations between their respective operational representatives.

14.2 **Escalation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved within twenty (20) Business Days of written notice of the Dispute, either Party may escalate the matter to senior management.

14.3 **Mediation.**  
If the Dispute remains unresolved thirty (30) days after escalation under Section 14.2, the Parties shall, prior to initiating litigation (except for urgent injunctive relief), attempt to resolve the Dispute through mediation under the auspices of the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) or another mutually agreed mediation body in London, United Kingdom.

## ARTICLE XV  
FORCE MAJEURE

15.1 **Definition.**

  (a) Client shall not be relieved of its obligation to pay Rent and Service Charges unless the Premises become wholly unfit for occupancy for a continuous period exceeding thirty (30) days due to a Force Majeure Event affecting the building (e.g., fire or structural damage), in which case Rent and Service Charges shall be equitably abated to reflect the extent and duration of the loss of use; and  

  (b) if the Premises are partially unusable, an equitable abatement shall apply to the proportional area and period affected.

15.4 **Prolonged Force Majeure.**  
If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than **ninety (90) days** and materially prevents Client’s use of the Premises or Vendor’s provision of the Services, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ written notice, without liability except for obligations accrued prior to the effective date of termination.
