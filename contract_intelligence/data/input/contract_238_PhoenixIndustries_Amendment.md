## ARTICLE XII  
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA) – ENHANCED SERVICES

12.1 **Relationship to Parent Service Levels.**  
The Service Levels set out in **Article XII** of the Parent Agreement continue to apply to the Premises generally. For the Amendment Premises Portion and Enhanced Services, the following additional or stricter Service Levels shall apply.

12.2 **Uptime Commitment.**  
For building systems essential to the operation of the Amendment Premises Portion (including power, HVAC, access control, and critical security systems), Phoenix shall use reasonable efforts to ensure an average **monthly uptime of 99.95%**, excluding scheduled maintenance and Force Majeure Events. This enhances the 99.9% uptime commitment in **Section 12.2** of the Parent Agreement.

12.3 **Response Times – Enhanced.**  
Phoenix shall adhere to the following **response time targets** for issues affecting the Amendment Premises Portion:

  (a) **Critical Issues** – response within **1 hour** during Business Days and within **2 hours** outside Business Days;  
  (b) **High Priority Issues** – response within **4 Business Hours**;  
  (c) **Routine Issues** – response within **1 Business Day**.

These targets supersede the response times in **Section 12.3** of the Parent Agreement solely with respect to the Amendment Premises Portion.

12.4 **Remedies for SLA Failures.**  
12.4.1 If Phoenix fails to meet the Enhanced Service Levels in any calendar month (excluding failures caused by Contoso or Force Majeure Events), Contoso shall be entitled to the following Service Credits with respect to the Amended Service Fees for that month:

  (a) Uptime below 99.95% but at or above 99.5%: **3%** of the monthly Amended Service Fee;  
  (b) Uptime below 99.5%: **7%** of the monthly Amended Service Fee.

12.4.2 These Service Credits supplement, and for the Amendment Premises Portion supersede, the credit percentages in **Section 12.4** of the Parent Agreement.

12.5 **Limitations on Service Credits.**  
12.5.1 Service Credits shall not exceed **25%** of the monthly Amended Service Fee in any single month with respect to the Amendment Premises Portion, but shall otherwise be applied as described in **Section 12.5** of the Parent Agreement (as a credit against future invoices, not refunded in cash).  
12.5.2 Service Credits are Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for SLA failures, without prejudice to its other contractual remedies for non-SLA breaches.

12.6 **Procedure for Claiming Service Credits.**  
The procedure for claiming Service Credits set forth in **Section 12.6** of the Parent Agreement shall apply, provided that references to Service Fee shall, in respect of the Amendment Premises Portion, be read as Amended Service Fee.
