  (a) Availability between 99.0% and 99.95%: credit equal to 10% of the monthly fees attributable to the Extended Modules;  

  (b) Availability between 98.0% and 99.0%: credit equal to 15% of such monthly fees;  

  (c) Availability below 98.0%: credit equal to 25% of such monthly fees.

To receive a service credit, the Company must request it in writing within thirty (30) days following the end of the month in which the service level shortfall occurred. Service credits shall be applied against future fees and shall be the Company’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for failure to meet these Enhanced SLA Commitments, without limiting any rights under the Parent Agreement.
