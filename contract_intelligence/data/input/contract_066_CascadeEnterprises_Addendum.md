11.2 **Roles of the Parties.** To the extent Contoso provides Personal Data to Cascade for processing in connection with the Services, Contoso shall be deemed the “controller” (or equivalent term under Applicable Law) and Cascade shall be deemed the “processor” (or equivalent term), except where otherwise mandated by law.

Upon termination or expiration of this Addendum, or upon Contoso’s written request, Cascade shall promptly delete or return to Contoso all Personal Data in its possession or control, except to the extent retention is required by Applicable Law, in which case Cascade shall continue to protect such Personal Data in accordance with this Addendum.

11.8 **Data Subject Rights.** Cascade shall reasonably assist Contoso, to the extent legally required and technically feasible, in responding to requests from data subjects for access, rectification, deletion, or restriction of Personal Data, or for data portability, provided that Contoso is responsible for handling such requests and for determining how to respond under Applicable Law.

Service credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall be Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the Service Levels, subject to the limitations in Article IX, unless such failure constitutes a material breach not cured in accordance with Section 4.4.
