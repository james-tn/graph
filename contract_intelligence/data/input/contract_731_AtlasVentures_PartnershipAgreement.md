## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all Data Protection Laws applicable to its processing of Personal Data under this Agreement. To the extent Vendor processes Personal Data on behalf of Client, Vendor shall be deemed a “processor” and Client a “controller” (as those terms are defined under GDPR), and the Parties shall enter into any additional data processing agreement reasonably required by Client to satisfy Data Protection Laws.

11.2 **Use and Processing of Personal Data.** Vendor shall process Personal Data solely for the purpose of performing the Services and in accordance with Client’s documented instructions, this Agreement, and any applicable data processing agreement. Vendor shall not sell Personal Data or otherwise process Personal Data for its own benefit or any third party’s benefit, except as expressly authorized by Client.

11.3 **Security Measures.** Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, damage, alteration, or disclosure, consistent with industry best practices and the sensitivity of the Personal Data.

11.4 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of a confirmed accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data processed by Vendor under this Agreement (“Data Breach”), Vendor shall:

  (a) Notify Client without undue delay and in no case later than seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  
  (b) Provide Client with sufficient information to allow Client to meet any obligations to report or inform individuals or regulators under Data Protection Laws; and  
  (c) Take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of and prevent recurrence of the Data Breach.

11.5 **Subprocessors.** Vendor shall not engage any subcontractor to process Personal Data on behalf of Client without Client’s prior written approval (which may be provided in general terms). Vendor shall ensure that any approved subcontractors are bound by written agreements imposing data protection obligations that are no less protective than those imposed on Vendor under this Agreement.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.** Vendor shall provide reasonable assistance to Client, at Client’s expense, in responding to any requests from data subjects or regulators relating to Personal Data processed under this Agreement, where such assistance is required by Data Protection Laws.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Vendor shall retain Personal Data only for as long as reasonably necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Vendor shall, at Client’s option, return or securely delete all Personal Data in its possession or control, except where retention is required by Applicable Law. Any retained Personal Data shall remain subject to this Article XI.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Applicability.** To the extent Vendor provides any ongoing, system-based services or platforms as part of the Services (e.g., analytics dashboards, reporting portals), this **Article XII** sets forth the minimum Service Levels applicable to such services.

12.2 **Availability/Uptime.** Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the covered services are available at least **99.9%** of the time during each calendar month, excluding: (a) scheduled maintenance; (b) emergency maintenance; and (c) downtime caused by factors outside Vendor’s reasonable control (including Force Majeure Events and Client’s systems).

12.3 **Response Times.** Vendor shall respond to Client’s service requests and incidents within the following timeframes:

  (a) **Critical Issues (P1):** Within two (2) Business Hours;  
  (b) **Major Issues (P2):** Within four (4) Business Hours;  
  (c) **Minor Issues (P3):** Within one (1) Business Day.

For purposes of this Section, “respond” means Vendor has acknowledged the issue and begun triage or remediation.

12.4 **Remedies for SLA Breaches.**  

  12.4.1 If Vendor fails to meet the availability target in **Section 12.2** in any given calendar month, Client shall be entitled, upon written request, to a service credit equal to a percentage of the monthly Fees attributable to the affected service, as follows:

  - Uptime < 99.9% and ≥ 99.0%: 5% credit  
  - Uptime < 99.0% and ≥ 98.0%: 10% credit  
  - Uptime < 98.0%: 20% credit

  12.4.2 Service credits shall be applied to future invoices and shall not be redeemable for cash. The service credits described herein constitute Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for Vendor’s failure to meet the Service Levels, without prejudice to Client’s rights to terminate for material breach if Vendor’s failures are persistent and material.
