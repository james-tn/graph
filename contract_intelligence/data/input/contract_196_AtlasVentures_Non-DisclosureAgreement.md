2.1.2 The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement is intended to serve as a **master framework** under which multiple projects or workstreams may be initiated. Each project may be described in a separate SOW referencing this Agreement and specifying the applicable Deliverables, milestones, timelines, resources, and Fees.

### 2.2 Deliverables

2.2.1 Vendor shall develop and deliver to Client the Deliverables identified in each SOW, which may include, by way of example and without limitation:

- Detailed business requirement documents and functional specifications;
- Solution architecture diagrams and integration design documents;

- Data models, ETL (extract, transform, load) processes, and associated documentation;
- Analytical dashboards and reports tailored to Client’s designated key performance indicators (KPIs);
- User training materials, user guides, knowledge base articles, and operational runbooks; and
- Periodic performance reports summarizing service levels, incidents, and remediation activities.

2.2.2 Each Deliverable shall be deemed accepted upon Client’s written confirmation of acceptance or, if no written confirmation is provided, upon the expiration of any mutually agreed-upon review period specified in the applicable SOW, provided that Client has not delivered a written notice specifying material deficiencies or nonconformities with the SOW. If Client reasonably rejects a Deliverable, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy such deficiency within a mutually agreed cure period and resubmit the Deliverable for Client’s review.

### 2.3 Performance Standards

2.3.1 Vendor shall perform the Services (a) in a professional and workmanlike manner, (b) in accordance with generally accepted industry standards for services of a similar nature, and (c) in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances, as further set forth in **Article VII**.

2.3.2 Vendor shall assign personnel with appropriate skills, experience, and qualifications for each project. Vendor shall be solely responsible for the supervision, direction, and compensation of its personnel, as well as the payment of all applicable taxes, social security contributions, and other statutory obligations related thereto.

2.3.3 Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet any timelines, milestones, and delivery dates specified in the applicable SOW. If Vendor anticipates that it may be unable to meet a specified milestone or delivery date, Vendor shall promptly notify Client in writing, explain the reason for the delay, and propose a revised delivery schedule. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to adjust project schedules, scope, or resources as appropriate, including through the change management process in **Article XIII**, where applicable.

2.3.4 Time is important but not of the essence, except where expressly stated in an SOW or where delay would materially impact Client’s critical business operations as stated in writing by Client in advance. In the event of delays materially caused by Client (for example, failure to provide timely access to systems, facilities, data, or decision-making), Vendor shall be entitled to a reasonable extension of time and an equitable adjustment to Fees, to be agreed in writing.

### 2.4 Cooperation and Client Responsibilities
