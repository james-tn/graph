## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 The general limitation of liability provisions in **Article IX** of the Parent Agreement are superseded solely as they apply to this Addendum and replaced with the following:

9.1.1 **NO CAP ON LIABILITY**. For Claims arising solely under or in connection with this Addendum, **there shall be no contractual cap on Phoenix’s or Contoso’s liability**. The aggregate limitation in **Section 9.2.1 of the Parent Agreement** (five (5) times the Fees paid or payable) shall **not** apply to this Addendum.

9.1.2 **CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES**. Unlike **Section 9.1.1 of the Parent Agreement**, the Parties agree that, in light of the high criticality of the HAPCE Project and the High Risk Level:

(a) Both Parties may be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, including lost profits, loss of business, and loss or corruption of data, arising out of or relating to this Addendum;  
(b) Any such damages must be proved in accordance with applicable law and shall not be speculative.

9.1.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that certain statutory or common-law limitations (e.g., duty to mitigate) may still apply and nothing herein shall be construed as a waiver of any non-waivable legal protections.

## ARTICLE X  
## INSURANCE

10.1 Phoenix shall maintain insurance coverage as described in **Article X (Insurance)** of the Parent Agreement, at the same or higher limits, throughout the Term of this Addendum.

10.2 Given the High Risk Level and the criticality of the HAPCE Project, Phoenix agrees to:

(a) Maintain Cyber Liability/Data Breach insurance with limits of not less than **US$5,000,000** per claim and in the aggregate (increased from the US$2,000,000 requirement in **Section 10.1.1(d)** of the Parent Agreement); and  
(b) Provide updated certificates of insurance upon Contoso’s request, explicitly referencing the HAPCE Project and this Addendum.

## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 The data protection and privacy obligations set forth in **Article XI** of the Parent Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and shall apply to all personal data processed by Phoenix in connection with this Addendum.

11.2 Phoenix acknowledges that Migration Services under this Addendum may involve access to and processing of personal data, and Phoenix shall:

(a) Process such data solely on documented instructions from Contoso, as required by **Section 11.2.1 of the Parent Agreement**;  
(b) Implement relevant technical and organizational measures as described in **Section 11.3.1** of the Parent Agreement.

11.3 In the event of a personal data breach related to systems or environments deployed under this Addendum, Phoenix shall notify Contoso in accordance with **Section 11.5 of the Parent Agreement**, and shall cooperate with Contoso in any legally required notifications to data subjects or regulators.

11.4 Upon termination or expiration of this Addendum, Phoenix shall, at Contoso’s written direction, return or securely delete personal data processed in connection with the HAPCE Project, consistent with **Section 11.7 of the Parent Agreement**.

12.2.1 For any private cloud management and orchestration components operated or managed by Phoenix under this Addendum, Phoenix shall use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve **99.95%** uptime per calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance and Force Majeure Events, which exceeds the 99.9% commitment in **Section 12.1.1 of the Parent Agreement**.

12.3 **Response and Resolution Times (Enhanced)**

12.3.1 Phoenix shall target the following response times for incidents related to the HAPCE Project:

- **Priority 1 (Critical – Production Outage)**: Response within **30 minutes**, continuous work until resolution or agreed workaround;  
- **Priority 2 (High – Major Degradation)**: Response within **2 hours**;  
- **Priority 3 (Normal – Non-Critical Issues)**: Response within **1 Business Day**.

12.4 **Service Credits (Addendum)**

12.4.1 If Phoenix fails to meet the uptime commitment or response time targets in a given month, Contoso shall be entitled to Service Credits (Addendum) equal to:

(b) One percent (1%) of the monthly Enhanced Support Services Fees for each Priority 1 response time failure, up to an additional 10%.

12.4.2 Service Credits (Addendum) shall be Contoso’s primary contractual remedy for SLA failures under this Addendum, but shall **not** be Contoso’s exclusive remedy given the High Risk Level and the uncapped liability arrangement under **Article IX**.

14.2 The Parties agree that, given the complexity and criticality of the HAPCE Project, they will use commercially reasonable efforts to expedite mediation and seek interim relief where appropriate to prevent irreparable harm, consistent with **Section 14.3.2 of the Parent Agreement**.
