For fixed-price implementation components, the Parties may agree on milestone-based payment schedules in the relevant SOW. Upon achievement of a milestone and acceptance of the associated Deliverables in accordance with **Section 2.5**, Meridian may issue an invoice for the corresponding milestone amount.

Any undisputed invoiced amounts not paid by Contoso within the payment terms specified in **Section 3.3** shall accrue interest at a rate of one percent (1%) per month or the maximum rate permitted under Applicable Law, whichever is lower, calculated from the date such amounts were due until the date of actual payment. Meridian shall provide written notice of any overdue payment prior to charging interest, and the Parties shall use good faith efforts to resolve any billing issues.

**3.8 Disputed Amounts.**  
If Contoso in good faith disputes any portion of an invoice, Contoso shall notify Meridian in writing within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt of the invoice, specifying the nature of the dispute.

Failure to dispute an invoice in good faith within the foregoing period shall constitute acceptance of the invoice.

**3.9 Adjustments to Fees.**  
Any adjustments to the Contract Value or Fees resulting from changes in scope, additional Services, or changes in assumptions shall be documented in a Change Order in accordance with **Article XIII**. No such adjustments shall be effective unless agreed upon in writing by both Parties.

## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

**11.1 Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Laws relating to data protection and privacy, including, where applicable, the **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**, the **California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)**, and the **EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, and any similar laws or regulations that may apply to the processing of Personal Data under this Agreement.

**11.2 Roles of the Parties.**  
For purposes of data protection laws, Contoso is generally the “controller” (or “business” under CCPA) of Client Data, and Meridian acts as a “processor” (or “service provider” under CCPA) to the extent it processes Personal Data on behalf of Contoso. Meridian shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Contoso, as set forth in this Agreement, the applicable SOW, or as otherwise expressly instructed in writing by Contoso.

**11.3 Data Processing Obligations of Meridian.**  
In relation to any Personal Data processed by Meridian on behalf of Contoso, Meridian shall:

  (a) process such Personal Data only for the purposes of performing the Services and in accordance with Contoso’s documented instructions and this Agreement;  

  (b) implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, such data;  

  (c) ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data are subject to confidentiality obligations;  

  (d) not sell Personal Data or otherwise use Personal Data in any manner that would cause Meridian to be considered a “third party” under the CCPA with respect to such data; and  

  (e) assist Contoso, to a reasonable extent, in responding to data subject requests and in complying with Contoso’s obligations under Applicable Law relating to security, breach notifications, impact assessments, and consultations with supervisory authorities.

**11.4 Subprocessors.**  
Meridian may engage subprocessors to process Personal Data on its behalf, provided that: (a) Meridian enters into a written agreement with each subprocessor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this **Article XI**; and (b) Meridian remains responsible for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors as if they were Meridian’s own. Upon request, Meridian shall provide Contoso with a list of its current subprocessors involved in the performance of the Services.

**11.5 Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed unauthorized access to, or acquisition, use, disclosure, or loss of Personal Data that Meridian processes on behalf of Contoso (a “Data Breach”), Meridian shall:

  (a) notify Contoso without undue delay, and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  

  (b) provide Contoso with reasonably sufficient information to enable Contoso to meet its own obligations under Applicable Law, including a description of the nature of the breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records concerned, and the likely consequences;  

  (c) take reasonable steps to contain, investigate, and remediate the Data Breach, and to prevent recurrence; and  

  (d) cooperate with Contoso in good faith, at Meridian’s expense to the extent the Data Breach was caused by Meridian’s breach of this Agreement, in any notifications to affected individuals or regulatory authorities as required by Applicable Law.

**11.6 Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Meridian shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon Contoso’s written request, Meridian shall, at Contoso’s option, securely delete or return all Personal Data in its possession or control, subject to the retention of archival copies as permitted under **Section 5.5** and any legal retention requirements.

**11.7 Cross-Border Transfers.**  
To the extent Meridian transfers Personal Data originating from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland to countries that do not provide an adequate level of data protection as determined by Applicable Law, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards, such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses or other lawful mechanisms, as may be required.

## ARTICLE XII – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

**12.1 Uptime Commitment.**  
If Meridian provides ongoing managed or hosted Services under any SOW, Meridian shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the covered Services are available 99.9% of the time during each calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and Permitted Downtime (as defined below).

**12.2 Scheduled Maintenance and Permitted Downtime.**  
“Scheduled Maintenance” means maintenance windows scheduled by Meridian that may result in temporary unavailability of the Services, provided that Meridian shall use reasonable efforts to schedule such maintenance during off-peak hours and shall provide at least seventy-two (72) hours prior notice to Contoso. “Permitted Downtime” includes Scheduled Maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) Contoso’s or its third parties’ systems, networks, or equipment; (b) force majeure events under **Article XV**; or (c) Contoso’s misuse or unauthorized modification of the Services.

**12.3 Incident Response Times.**  
Meridian shall respond to incidents reported by Contoso in accordance with the following target response times, measured from the time Meridian receives a properly logged ticket in Meridian’s support system:

  - **Severity 1 (Critical – System Down):** Response within one (1) hour, 24x7.  
  - **Severity 2 (High – Major Functionality Impacted):** Response within four (4) hours during Business Days.  
  - **Severity 3 (Medium – Minor Functionality Impacted):** Response within one (1) Business Day.  
  - **Severity 4 (Low – General Questions/Requests):** Response within two (2) Business Days.

**12.4 Remedies for SLA Breaches.**  
If the actual monthly uptime for the covered Services falls below 99.9% (excluding Permitted Downtime), Contoso may be eligible for service credits as follows:

  - Uptime between 99.0% and 99.9%: 5% of the monthly recurring Fee for the affected Service;  
  - Uptime between 98.0% and 99.0%: 10% of the monthly recurring Fee for the affected Service;  
  - Uptime below 98.0%: 15% of the monthly recurring Fee for the affected Service.

Service credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall not be redeemable for cash. To receive a service credit, Contoso must submit a written request within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the SLA breach occurred. Service credits, together with any other remedies expressly provided in this **Article XII**, shall constitute Contoso’s sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the Service Levels, except where such failure constitutes a material breach of this Agreement.

## ARTICLE XIII – CHANGE MANAGEMENT

**13.1 Change Requests.**  
Either Party may request changes to the scope of Services, Deliverables, timelines, or assumptions by submitting a written change request (“Change Request”) to the other Party. Each Change Request shall describe in reasonable detail the proposed change, justification, and any anticipated impacts.

**13.2 Evaluation of Changes.**  
Upon receipt of a Change Request, the receiving Party shall promptly review and evaluate the requested change. Meridian shall evaluate the technical and commercial impact of any change requested by Contoso and provide a written proposal, including any adjustments to Fees, timelines, resource requirements, and other affected terms.

**13.3 Change Orders.**  
If the Parties agree to implement a proposed change, they shall document such change in a Change Order, which shall be signed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties. No Change Request shall be binding upon the Parties unless and until formalized in a signed Change Order. Once executed, the Change Order shall form part of this Agreement and shall supersede any inconsistent provisions in the relevant SOW.

**13.4 Continuity of Services.**  
Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, Meridian shall continue performing the Services in accordance with the existing SOW and this Agreement during the evaluation and negotiation of any Change Request.

---

## ARTICLE XIV – DISPUTE RESOLUTION

**14.1 Negotiation and Escalation.**  
In the event of any Dispute, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the matter through informal discussions between the project managers. If the Dispute is not resolved within fifteen (15) Business Days, either Party may escalate the matter to senior management representatives of each Party, who shall confer in good faith to attempt to resolve the Dispute within an additional fifteen (15) Business Days.

**14.2 Mediation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through negotiation and escalation as described in **Section 14.1**, the Parties agree to attempt to resolve the Dispute through non-binding mediation before a mutually agreed mediator in California. The mediation shall occur within forty-five (45) days after a Party requests mediation in writing, unless the Parties agree otherwise. The Parties shall share equally the mediator’s fees and expenses.

**14.3 Arbitration or Litigation.**  
If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through mediation within sixty (60) days after the mediator is appointed, either Party may pursue final resolution as follows:

  (a) **Arbitration Option.** If both Parties agree in writing, the Dispute may be submitted to binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, with one (1) arbitrator, in San Francisco, California. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

  (b) **Litigation.** In the absence of a written agreement to arbitrate, the Dispute shall be resolved exclusively by the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and each Party irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

**14.4 Interim Relief.**  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary or preliminary injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or curtail any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement, particularly regarding Confidential Information or Intellectual Property Rights, without first engaging in the negotiation, mediation, or arbitration procedures above.

A “Force Majeure Event” means any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of a Party, including, but not limited to, acts of God, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics, war, terrorism, civil unrest, labor disputes (excluding strikes or work stoppages limited to a Party’s own workforce), governmental actions, interruptions or failures of telecommunications or power infrastructure not caused by a Party, or other similar events.

**15.2 Excused Performance.**  
Neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement (other than payment obligations) to the extent such failure or delay is caused by a Force Majeure Event, provided that the affected Party:

  (b) uses commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the Force Majeure Event and resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable.
