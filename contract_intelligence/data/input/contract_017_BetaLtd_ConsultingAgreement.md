(b) Each SOW shall be deemed incorporated into and governed by this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any SOW, the terms of this Agreement shall control unless the SOW expressly states that it is intended to supersede specific provisions of this Agreement, in which case the SOW shall prevail solely with respect to the subject matter thereof.

2.4 **Timelines and Milestones.**  
(a) The Service Provider shall perform the Services in accordance with the schedules and milestones set forth in the applicable SOW.  

(b) The Parties acknowledge that project timelines may be dependent on timely cooperation and inputs from the Company, including the provision of Client Materials, decisions, approvals, and access to relevant systems and personnel.

(c) If the Service Provider becomes aware that any milestone is unlikely to be met, the Service Provider shall promptly notify the Company in writing, stating the reasons for the delay and proposing a revised timeline. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to mitigate the impact of such delay and to agree upon any appropriate adjustments to the project schedule and Fees.

  (a) Provide timely access to its personnel, systems, facilities, and Client Materials reasonably required by the Service Provider to perform the Services;  

  (b) Designate a project manager or primary point of contact to coordinate communications with the Service Provider and to make decisions on behalf of the Company in connection with the Services;

2.7 **Acceptance of Deliverables.**  
(a) Each SOW shall specify the acceptance criteria and acceptance process for Deliverables. Unless otherwise provided in an SOW, the Company shall have fifteen (15) Business Days from receipt of a Deliverable to review and either (i) provide written notice of acceptance, or (ii) provide written notice of rejection specifying in reasonable detail the deficiencies in the Deliverable relative to the applicable acceptance criteria.

In the event of a claim of infringement covered by Section 8.1, the Service Provider may, at its option and expense: (a) procure for the Company the right to continue using the affected Services or Deliverables; (b) replace or modify the Services or Deliverables so that they are non-infringing but substantially equivalent in functionality; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected Services or Deliverables and refund to the Company any prepaid but unused Fees for such Services or Deliverables.

## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.**  
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

9.2 **Liability Cap.**  
EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS (DEFINED BELOW), AND SUBJECT TO SECTION 9.3, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED THREE (3) TIMES THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY THE COMPANY TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY.

9.3 **Excluded Claims.**  
The limitations and exclusions in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 shall not apply to: (a) a Party’s indemnification obligations under Article VIII; (b) a Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under Article V (excluding ordinary business damages, but including only direct damages for breach); (c) a Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (d) the Service Provider’s infringement of the Company’s Intellectual Property Rights (collectively, the “**Excluded Claims**”). For Excluded Claims, the total aggregate liability of a Party shall not exceed five (5) times the total Fees paid or payable under this Agreement during the twelve (12) months preceding the first event giving rise to the Excluded Claim, except to the extent that Applicable Law does not permit such limitation.

9.4 **Allocation of Risk.**  
The Parties acknowledge that the limitations of liability set forth in this Article IX are an essential element of the bargain between the Parties and that, were such limitations not included, the economic terms of this Agreement would be substantially different.

## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in the performance of its obligations and the exercise of its rights under this Agreement.

11.2 **Processing of Personal Data.**  
The Service Provider shall:

  (a) Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from the Company, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by Applicable Law;
