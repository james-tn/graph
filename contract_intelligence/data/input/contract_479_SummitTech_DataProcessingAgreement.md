## ARTICLE XI  
### DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with Data Protection Laws applicable to its role. Summit Tech shall provide reasonable cooperation and assistance to enable Contoso to comply with its obligations as Controller/Business, including in relation to data subject rights, security, and Data Breach notifications.

11.2 **Security Measures.**  
Summit Tech shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access, as required by Article 32 of the GDPR and comparable provisions under other Data Protection Laws. Such measures shall include, at a minimum:

  (a) access controls and authentication mechanisms (including role-based access controls);  
  (b) encryption of Personal Data in transit and at rest using industry standard encryption protocols;  
  (c) regular security patching and vulnerability management;  
  (d) data backup and disaster recovery procedures designed to ensure timely restoration of availability; and  
  (e) security awareness training for personnel with access to Personal Data.

11.3 **Sub-processors.**  
Summit Tech may engage Sub-processors to Process Personal Data, provided that:

  (a) Summit Tech enters into a written agreement with each Sub-processor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this DPA;  
  (b) Summit Tech remains fully liable for any acts or omissions of its Sub-processors; and  
  (c) Summit Tech maintains an up-to-date list of Sub-processors and, upon Contoso’s written request, shall provide such list. Where required by Data Protection Laws, Summit Tech shall notify Contoso of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of Sub-processors, thereby giving Contoso the opportunity to object on reasonable grounds. If Contoso reasonably objects and no alternative solution can be agreed, Contoso may terminate the affected Services without penalty.

11.4 **Data Subject Requests.**  
To the extent Contoso is unable to fulfill data subject requests by itself, Summit Tech shall, taking into account the nature of the Processing, provide reasonable assistance to Contoso by appropriate technical and organizational measures, in responding to requests from Data Subjects exercising their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, and objection). Summit Tech shall promptly notify Contoso if it receives a data subject request directly and shall not respond except as instructed by Contoso or as required by Applicable Law.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed Data Breach, Summit Tech shall:

  (a) notify Contoso without undue delay and, in any event, no later than **seventy-two (72) hours** after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  
  (b) provide Contoso with information reasonably required to meet its obligations under Data Protection Laws, including the nature of the incident, categories and approximate number of Data Subjects affected, categories and approximate volume of data records affected, likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to address the breach;  
  (c) take reasonable steps to contain, mitigate, and remediate the Data Breach; and  
  (d) cooperate with Contoso, at Contoso’s cost (unless the Data Breach is attributable to Summit Tech’s breach of this Agreement, in which case costs shall be borne by Summit Tech), in any investigation, notification, or remediation efforts.

11.6 **Data Protection Impact Assessments and Audit Rights.**  
Summit Tech shall provide reasonable assistance to Contoso with any data protection impact assessments and prior consultations with supervisory authorities that are required under Data Protection Laws, taking into account the nature of Processing and the information available to Summit Tech. Contoso may, no more than once annually (unless required more frequently by a supervisory authority or due to a Data Breach), conduct a security and data protection audit of Summit Tech’s relevant facilities and systems, either by Contoso’s internal auditors or by an independent third-party auditor, subject to:

  (a) reasonable advance written notice (at least thirty (30) days, unless shorter notice is required by a supervisory authority);  
  (b) mutual agreement on the scope, timing, and duration of the audit;  
  (c) execution of a confidentiality agreement by the auditor; and  
  (d) ensuring that any audit does not unreasonably interfere with Summit Tech’s business operations or compromise other customers’ data.

Summit Tech may charge a reasonable fee for audits beyond one (1) per year, except where an additional audit is required by a supervisory authority or is directly triggered by a Data Breach attributable to Summit Tech.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Summit Tech shall retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the Services or as required by Applicable Law. At Contoso’s written election upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Summit Tech shall either:

  (a) securely delete all Personal Data (including existing copies) in its possession or control; or  
  (b) return all Personal Data to Contoso in a commonly used, machine-readable format and then securely delete remaining copies.

Summit Tech may retain Personal Data solely to the extent and for such period as required by Applicable Law or for legitimate archiving/backup purposes, in which case Summit Tech shall ensure that such Personal Data is protected in accordance with this Agreement and is not actively Processed for any other purpose.

11.8 **International Data Transfers.**  
To the extent Summit Tech’s Processing of Personal Data involves a Restricted Transfer, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards as required by Data Protection Laws, which may include execution of the SCCs or adoption of another lawful transfer mechanism. If the SCCs are utilized:

  (a) Contoso shall act as “data exporter” and Summit Tech as “data importer”;  
  (b) the details of Processing set forth in **Article II** shall be deemed incorporated into the relevant annexes of the SCCs; and  
  (c) if there is any conflict between this DPA and the SCCs, the SCCs shall prevail with respect to the Restricted Transfer.

11.9 **CCPA/CPRA Specific Provisions.**  
For Personal Data subject to the CCPA/CPRA:

  (a) Summit Tech shall act as a “Service Provider” or “Contractor” and acknowledges that it receives Personal Data from Contoso for the Business Purpose of providing the Services;  
  (b) Summit Tech is prohibited from: (i) selling or sharing Personal Data; (ii) retaining, using, or disclosing Personal Data for any purpose other than the Business Purpose specified in this Agreement, including retaining, using, or disclosing Personal Data for a commercial purpose other than the Business Purpose; and (iii) retaining, using, or disclosing Personal Data outside the direct business relationship between Summit Tech and Contoso;  
  (c) Summit Tech shall comply with applicable obligations under the CCPA/CPRA and shall provide the same level of privacy protection as is required of businesses under the CCPA/CPRA; and  
  (d) Contoso has the right to take reasonable and appropriate steps to help ensure that Summit Tech uses Personal Data in a manner consistent with Contoso’s obligations under the CCPA/CPRA, including through audit rights described in **Section 11.6**.

Upon receipt of a Change Request, the receiving Party shall review and, within a reasonable period (typically ten (10) Business Days), provide a written response stating whether it accepts, rejects, or proposes modifications to the Change Request.
