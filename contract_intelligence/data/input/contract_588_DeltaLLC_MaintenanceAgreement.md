Any increase beyond such threshold shall require the Client’s prior written consent.

The Vendor shall provide at least ten (10) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intent to apply such interest. If any undisputed amounts remain unpaid for more than sixty (60) days after the due date, and after at least one written reminder to the Client, the Vendor may, without liability and upon ten (10) Business Days’ written notice, suspend the performance of non-critical Services until such amounts are paid, provided that suspension shall not apply to critical Services needed to maintain basic operational stability.

The Vendor shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Client and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, the “**Client Indemnified Parties**”), from and against any and all third-party claims, demands, suits, actions, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) (collectively, “**Claims**”) arising out of or relating to:

  (a) any bodily injury, death, or damage to tangible property to the extent caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of the Vendor or its personnel in the performance of the Services;  
  (b) any allegation that the Services, Deliverables (excluding Client Materials and Third-Party Materials), or Vendor Pre-existing IP, when used in accordance with this Agreement, infringe any third party’s Intellectual Property Rights; and  
  (c) the Vendor’s material breach of its obligations under **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)** that results in a confirmed unauthorized disclosure of Personal Data caused by the Vendor’s failure to comply with this Agreement.

8.2 **Client Indemnification.**  
The Client shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Vendor and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, the “**Vendor Indemnified Parties**”), from and against any and all Claims arising out of or relating to:

  (a) any bodily injury, death, or damage to tangible property to the extent caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of the Client or its personnel;

8.3 **Indemnification Procedures.**  
The obligations of the indemnifying Party (the “**Indemnitor**”) under this **Article VIII** are conditioned upon the indemnified Party (the “**Indemnitee**”):

  (a) providing the Indemnitor with prompt written notice of any Claim (provided that failure to provide such prompt notice shall only relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations to the extent it is materially prejudiced thereby);  
  (b) granting the Indemnitor sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim (except that the Indemnitor shall not settle any Claim without the Indemnitee’s prior written consent if the settlement imposes any admission of liability or obligation on the Indemnitee); and  
  (c) providing the Indemnitor with reasonable assistance, at the Indemnitor’s expense, in connection with the defense and settlement of the Claim.

8.4 **Infringement Mitigation.**  
In the event of any claim of infringement covered by **Section 8.1(b)**, or if, in the Vendor’s reasonable opinion, the Services or Deliverables are likely to become subject to such a claim, the Vendor may, at its expense and in its discretion: (a) procure for the Client the right to continue using the Services or Deliverables; (b) modify or replace the Services or Deliverables so that they are non-infringing but functionally equivalent; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate the affected Services or Deliverables and refund to the Client any prepaid Fees for Services not yet performed or Deliverables not yet provided. The foregoing states the Client’s exclusive remedy and the Vendor’s exclusive liability for any infringement of Intellectual Property Rights under this Agreement.

## ARTICLE XI. DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with its performance of this Agreement.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.**  
The Vendor shall process Personal Data only on documented instructions from the Client, including with respect to transfers of Personal Data to a third country, unless required to do so by applicable law, in which case the Vendor shall inform the Client of such requirement before processing, unless such law prohibits such disclosure.

11.3 **Security Measures.**  
The Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, taking into account the state of the art, costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing.

11.4 **Subprocessors.**  
The Vendor may engage subprocessors to assist in the processing of Personal Data, provided that: (a) the Vendor imposes data protection obligations on such subprocessors that are no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement; and (b) the Vendor remains fully liable for the acts and omissions of such subprocessors.

11.5 **Data Subject Requests.**  
To the extent legally permitted, the Vendor shall promptly notify the Client of any request received from a data subject regarding access, rectification, erasure, or restriction of processing of Personal Data processed under this Agreement.

## ARTICLE XII. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

12.1 **Uptime Commitment.**  
Subject to the exclusions in **Section 12.4**, the Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the critical components of the Maintained Environment for which the Vendor has full maintenance responsibility achieve an uptime of at least **99.9%** during each calendar month (“**Uptime Commitment**”).

12.2 **Incident Priority Levels and Response/Resolution Times.**  
The Parties agree to classify incidents according to the following priority levels, with associated Response and Resolution Targets:

  (a) **Priority 1 (Critical):** Complete outage or severe degradation of a critical system with no workaround, causing significant business disruption.  
  - Response Time: within 1 hour (24x7)  
  - Resolution Target: within 4 hours or workaround that materially mitigates the issue  

  (b) **Priority 2 (High):** Major functionality impaired with business impact, but partial workarounds exist.  
  - Response Time: within 2 Business Hours (during Standard Support Hours)  
  - Resolution Target: within 1 Business Day or workaround that significantly reduces the impact  

  (c) **Priority 3 (Medium):** Limited impact issues; non-critical functions affected; acceptable workarounds exist.  
  - Response Time: within 4 Business Hours  
  - Resolution Target: within 3 Business Days  

  (d) **Priority 4 (Low):** Minor issues, cosmetic defects, or general service requests.  
  - Response Time: within 1 Business Day  
  - Resolution Target: as scheduled, typically within 10 Business Days

12.3 **SLA Remedies.**  
If the Vendor fails to meet the Uptime Commitment in any calendar month (other than due to an exclusion under **Section 12.4**), the Client may be entitled to service credits as follows:

  - Uptime between 99.5% and 99.9%: credit equal to 5% of the monthly base maintenance fee;  
  - Uptime between 99.0% and 99.49%: credit equal to 10% of the monthly base maintenance fee;  
  - Uptime below 99.0%: credit equal to 15% of the monthly base maintenance fee.

Service credits shall be applied against the next invoice(s) issued to the Client. Service credits shall not, in the aggregate, exceed 20% of the base maintenance fee for the applicable month. The Client must request any applicable service credits in writing within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the failure occurred. Service credits are the Client’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for SLA failures, without prejudice to the Client’s termination rights under **Section 4.5**.

12.4 **SLA Exclusions.**  
The Uptime Commitment and related SLA metrics shall not apply to downtime or failures resulting from:

  (a) scheduled Maintenance Windows agreed in advance with the Client, provided the Vendor uses reasonable efforts to minimize impact;  
  (b) Client-caused outages or misconfigurations, including breaches of Client responsibilities in **Section 2.6**;  
  (c) failures of third-party services or infrastructure (e.g., public internet, Client’s external network providers) outside the Vendor’s reasonable control;  
  (d) Force Majeure Events, as defined in **Article XV**; or  
  (e) any suspension of Services in accordance with **Section 3.5** due to the Client’s non-payment of undisputed Fees.

Absent an effective Change Order, the Parties shall continue to perform their obligations in accordance with the then-current scope.

13.4 **Emergency Changes.**  
In urgent circumstances where immediate action is required to prevent or mitigate a critical incident, the Vendor may implement emergency changes to the Maintained Environment without a prior written Change Order, provided that the Vendor uses reasonable efforts to obtain verbal or email approval from the Client’s authorized contact and documents the change as soon as practicable. Any such emergency change shall be documented in a subsequent written Change Order, if it has material impact on scope, Fees, or schedule.

14.4 **Litigation.**  
If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through mediation within sixty (60) days after the mediator is appointed, either Party may pursue any remedies available at law or in equity.
