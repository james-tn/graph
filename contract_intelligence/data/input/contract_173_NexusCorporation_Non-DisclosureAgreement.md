## ARTICLE II  
## SCOPE OF SERVICES AND WORK

2.1 **General Scope.** Nexus shall provide to Contoso the Services and Deliverables described in this Agreement and in one or more Statements of Work entered into by the Parties. Each SOW shall reference **NDA-NEX-202507-173**, be signed by authorized representatives of both Parties, and shall set forth: (a) a detailed description of the Services and Deliverables; (b) project milestones and timelines; (c) applicable Service Levels; (d) Fees and payment schedule; and (e) any additional terms and conditions specific to that SOW.

2.2 **Project Overview.** The Parties anticipate that the Services shall include, without limitation:

  2.2.1 **Discovery and Requirements Gathering.** Nexus shall work with Contoso to understand Contoso’s existing technology environment, data architecture, business processes, and strategic objectives. Nexus shall conduct workshops, interviews, and technical assessments as required to document functional and technical requirements for the Project.

  2.2.2 **Solution Design.** Based on requirements, Nexus shall design an integrated data analytics and reporting solution, which may include: (a) data ingestion pipelines; (b) data transformation and normalization logic; (c) integration with Contoso’s existing platforms; (d) user interface and dashboard specifications; and (e) security and access controls. Nexus shall provide design documentation and architecture diagrams as part of the Deliverables.

  2.2.3 **Implementation and Configuration.** Nexus shall configure and implement the designed solution using Nexus Technology, Third‑Party Materials (if applicable), and Contoso’s systems. This may include custom development, configuration of software modules, setup of APIs, configuration of data connectors, and implementation of user roles and permissions.

  2.2.4 **Testing and Quality Assurance.** Nexus shall perform unit testing, system testing, and integration testing of the Deliverables. With Contoso’s participation, Nexus shall conduct user acceptance testing (“UAT”) to validate that Deliverables meet the agreed specifications and acceptance criteria set forth in the applicable SOW. Nexus shall remediate any material defects identified during testing within mutually agreed timeframes.

  2.2.5 **Training and Knowledge Transfer.** Nexus shall provide training sessions to Contoso’s designated personnel on the operation, administration, and maintenance of the Deliverables, as described in the applicable SOW. Training may be conducted onsite or remotely. Nexus shall also provide documentation, user guides, and technical references to facilitate ongoing use and support.

  2.2.6 **Support and Maintenance.** Where specified in an SOW, Nexus shall provide ongoing support and maintenance services, including incident management, bug fixes, updates, and minor enhancements, subject to the Service Levels defined in **Article XII** and/or the applicable SOW.

2.3 **Deliverables and Milestones.** Each SOW shall include a detailed description of the Deliverables, including any intermediate deliverables, and shall specify milestones and target completion dates. The Parties agree that:

  2.3.1 **Acceptance Criteria.** For each Deliverable, the relevant SOW shall define objective acceptance criteria. Contoso shall review each Deliverable within the review period specified in the SOW (or, if not specified, within fifteen (15) Business Days of delivery). If Contoso reasonably determines that a Deliverable does not meet the acceptance criteria, it shall provide Nexus with written notice describing the deficiencies. Nexus shall then promptly use commercially reasonable efforts to correct such deficiencies and resubmit the Deliverable for acceptance. If Contoso fails to provide notice of rejection within the review period, the Deliverable shall be deemed accepted.

  2.3.2 **Dependencies.** Nexus’s performance of the Services and delivery of Deliverables is subject to Contoso’s timely provision of necessary information, access, approvals, and resources as reasonably requested by Nexus. Any delays caused by Contoso’s failure to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement or an SOW may result in corresponding extensions of timelines and may entitle Nexus to equitable adjustments in Fees, as further governed by **Article XIII (Change Management)**.

2.4 **Performance Standards.** Nexus shall perform the Services: (a) in a professional and workmanlike manner, in accordance with generally accepted industry standards; (b) in conformity with the specifications and requirements set forth in the applicable SOW; and (c) in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Nexus shall assign adequately skilled and experienced personnel to perform the Services. If Contoso reasonably determines that any personnel assigned by Nexus are not performing to a professional standard, Contoso may request replacement of such personnel, and Nexus shall use commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate such request.

2.5 **Subcontractors.** Nexus may engage subcontractors to perform portions of the Services, provided that: (a) Nexus remains fully responsible for the performance of the Services and compliance with this Agreement by any subcontractor; (b) any subcontractor with access to Contoso’s Confidential Information or Contoso Data is bound by written obligations of confidentiality and data protection no less protective than those set forth herein; and (c) Nexus shall, upon Contoso’s reasonable request, identify its subcontractors involved with the Project, subject to confidentiality obligations.

2.6 **No Exclusivity.** Unless expressly stated in an SOW, this Agreement does not create an exclusive relationship between the Parties. Each Party is free to enter into similar agreements with third parties, provided that such relationships do not result in a breach of this Agreement or misuse of the other Party’s Confidential Information.

2.7 **Compliance with Policies.** To the extent Nexus personnel perform Services on Contoso’s premises or within Contoso’s systems, Nexus shall cause such personnel to comply with Contoso’s reasonable security, confidentiality, health and safety, and site access policies as communicated in advance and in writing, provided that such policies do not conflict with this Agreement.

Nexus shall submit itemized expense reports with supporting receipts, and Contoso shall reimburse approved expenses in accordance with the payment terms in Section 3.4.

3.8 **No Withholding or Set‑Off.** Except for amounts reasonably disputed in good faith, Contoso shall not withhold, set‑off, or deduct any amounts from payments due to Nexus under this Agreement, unless required by applicable law, in which case Contoso shall gross‑up such payments as necessary to ensure Nexus receives the full amount of Fees invoiced.

  - **Severity 1 (Critical)** – Complete loss of service or major incident that severely impacts Contoso’s core operations with no workaround available.  
    - Initial response: within 1 hour (24x7 for critical systems, if specified in SOW)  
    - Target resolution or workaround: within 8 hours

13.4 **Disputed Changes.** If the Parties cannot agree on a Change Request, the existing SOW shall remain in effect without modification, and Nexus shall continue performing the Services as originally agreed, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing.

13.5 **Emergency Changes.** In the event of an emergency that threatens the stability or security of the Services or Contoso’s systems, Nexus may implement temporary changes as necessary to address the emergency, provided that Nexus uses commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any adverse impact on Contoso and notifies Contoso promptly thereafter. Any lasting changes shall be documented and, if necessary, formalized through a Change Request.

## DISPUTE RESOLUTION; GOVERNING LAW

14.1 **Governing Law.** This Agreement, including **NDA-NEX-202507-173**, and any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of **New York**, without giving effect to any choice‑of‑law or conflict‑of‑law rules that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

14.2 **Good Faith Negotiations.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof (a “**Dispute**”), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through informal discussions between operational contacts. If the Dispute is not resolved within ten (10) Business Days, either Party may escalate the Dispute by providing written notice to the other Party.

14.3 **Executive Escalation.** Within ten (10) Business Days after such escalation notice, each Party shall appoint a senior executive with decision‑making authority who shall meet (in person, by videoconference, or teleconference) to attempt to resolve the Dispute. The executives shall negotiate in good faith for a period of up to thirty (30) days following their initial meeting.

14.4 **Mediation (Optional).** If the Dispute remains unresolved after executive escalation, the Parties may mutually agree to attempt to resolve the Dispute through non‑binding mediation conducted by a mutually agreed mediator in New York, New York, or another location agreed by the Parties. The costs of mediation shall be shared equally, except that each Party shall bear its own attorney’s fees and costs.

14.5 **Arbitration or Litigation.** If the Parties do not resolve the Dispute through negotiation or mediation within a reasonable period, either Party may pursue final resolution as follows:

  14.5.1 **Court Proceedings.** Unless the Parties agree in writing to binding arbitration, the Dispute shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in **New York County, New York**, and each Party irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection based on inconvenient forum.

  14.5.2 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek interim or injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Confidential Information or Intellectual Property Rights, or to prevent irreparable harm, without first complying with the escalation and mediation procedures set forth above.

14.6 **Attorney’s Fees.** In any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, in addition to any other remedies to which it may be entitled.
