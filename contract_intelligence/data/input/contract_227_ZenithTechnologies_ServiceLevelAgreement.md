Suspension shall not relieve the Client of its obligation to pay all fees due under this Agreement.

3.5 **Disputed Amounts.**  
If the Client disputes any portion of an invoice in good faith, the Client shall: (a) pay the undisputed portion of the invoice by the due date; and (b) provide written notice of the dispute, including reasonable details, within fifteen (15) days of the invoice date.

The Vendor shall provide reasonable documentation for reimbursable expenses.

3.8 **Fee Adjustments.**  
The Vendor may adjust recurring fees no more than once per calendar year, effective upon at least sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to the Client.

The Client shall pay all amounts due under this Agreement without set-off, counterclaim, deduction, or withholding, except as may be required by applicable law. If any deduction or withholding is required, the Client shall pay such additional amounts as necessary so that the net amount received by the Vendor equals the full amount that the Vendor would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required.

## ARTICLE XI  
### DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with all applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with the performance of this Agreement. To the extent the Vendor processes personal data on behalf of the Client, the Parties shall execute a separate data processing addendum (“**DPA**”), which shall supplement and form part of this Agreement.

11.2 **Roles of the Parties.**  
For purposes of GDPR and similar laws, the Client is the “controller” (or equivalent term) and the Vendor is the “processor” (or equivalent term) with respect to personal data processed in the context of the Services, except where the Vendor determines the purposes and means of processing for its own legitimate business purposes.

11.3 **Data Security.**  
The Vendor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, consistent with the nature of the data and the risks presented by the processing. Such measures shall be described in the DPA or separate security documentation provided to the Client.

11.4 **Subprocessors.**  
The Client authorizes the Vendor to engage subprocessors to process personal data in connection with the Services, subject to the Vendor entering into written agreements with such subprocessors imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set forth in this Agreement and any DPA. The Vendor shall remain responsible for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a confirmed breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data processed by the Vendor on behalf of the Client (“**Data Breach**”), the Vendor shall:

  a. Notify the Client without undue delay and, in any event, within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  
  b. Provide the Client with reasonable information about the nature of the Data Breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records concerned, and likely consequences; and  
  c. Take reasonable steps to contain, investigate, and remediate the Data Breach and cooperate with the Client in meeting any obligations to notify affected individuals or supervisory authorities.

11.6 **Data Subject Rights.**  
To the extent the Vendor receives a request from a data subject seeking to exercise rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., access, deletion, portability) in relation to personal data processed on behalf of the Client, the Vendor shall promptly notify the Client and shall direct the data subject to submit such request to the Client. The Vendor shall reasonably assist the Client, at the Client’s expense, in responding to such requests.

11.7 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
The Vendor shall retain Client personal data for the duration of the Term and thereafter as necessary for legitimate business purposes, including legal, regulatory, and audit requirements. Upon the Client’s written request and subject to applicable law, the Vendor shall delete or return personal data within a reasonable timeframe following termination or expiration, provided that the Vendor may retain copies for backup or archival purposes or as required by law.

11.8 **International Transfers.**  
To the extent the Services involve the transfer of personal data outside the jurisdiction from which it was collected, the Vendor shall implement appropriate safeguards to ensure an adequate level of protection for such personal data, including standard contractual clauses, certification mechanisms, or other lawful transfer mechanisms.

## ARTICLE XII  
### SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Availability.**  
The Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the production environment for the Services is available at least **99.9%** of the time during each calendar month, excluding Scheduled Maintenance and Excluded Downtime (the “**Uptime Commitment**”).

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  
The Vendor may perform scheduled maintenance during designated maintenance windows. The Vendor shall provide the Client with at least five (5) Business Days’ prior notice for planned maintenance expected to cause service unavailability exceeding thirty (30) minutes. Scheduled Maintenance shall not count as downtime for purposes of the Uptime Commitment.

12.3 **Incident Classification and Response.**  
Incidents shall be classified by severity as follows:

  a. **Severity 1 (Critical):** Complete loss of service or severe degradation impacting all users with no available Workaround. Target initial response time: thirty (30) minutes; target Workaround or restoration: four (4) hours.  
  b. **Severity 2 (High):** Significant functionality impaired impacting a substantial subset of users, with limited Workaround. Target initial response time: one (1) hour; target Workaround or restoration: eight (8) hours.  
  c. **Severity 3 (Medium):** Partial loss of non-critical functionality or performance issues with acceptable Workaround. Target initial response time: four (4) hours; target Workaround or restoration: three (3) Business Days.  
  d. **Severity 4 (Low):** Minor issues, cosmetic defects, or general inquiries. Target initial response time: one (1) Business Day; target resolution: best efforts within subsequent release or maintenance cycle.

Response and resolution times are targets and not guarantees; however, repeated or material failures to achieve such targets may trigger Service Credits as described in **Section 12.5**.

12.4 **Measurement and Reporting.**  
Service availability shall be measured by the Vendor’s monitoring tools and logs. On a monthly basis, the Vendor shall provide the Client with a report detailing actual uptime, Incidents, and performance against Service Level Targets.

12.5 **Service Credits.**  
If, in any calendar month, the Vendor fails to meet the Uptime Commitment, the Client shall be eligible to receive Service Credits as follows:

  a. Uptime between 99.0% and 99.9%: 5% of the monthly recurring fee for the affected Service;  
  b. Uptime between 98.0% and 99.0%: 10% of the monthly recurring fee for the affected Service;  
  c. Uptime below 98.0%: 20% of the monthly recurring fee for the affected Service.

Service Credits shall be applied against future invoices and shall not be redeemable for cash. The Client must request Service Credits in writing within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the SLA breach occurred; failure to do so waives the Client’s right to Service Credits for that month.

12.6 **Excluded Downtime.**  
Downtime shall not include unavailability or performance issues caused by:  
  a. Scheduled Maintenance;  
  b. Force Majeure Events pursuant to **Article XV**;  
  c. Internet or network outages outside the Vendor’s control;  
  d. Misuse of the Services by the Client or its users; or  
  e. Incidents attributable to Third-Party Materials or Client systems not managed by the Vendor.

12.7 **Exclusive Remedy for SLA Breaches.**  
The Service Credits provided in this **Article XII** constitute the Client’s sole and exclusive remedy, and the Vendor’s sole and exclusive liability, for any failure to meet the Service Level Targets.

## ARTICLE XIII  
### CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.**  
Either Party may propose changes to the scope of Services, Service Level Targets, Deliverables, or other aspects of this Agreement or an SOW (a “**Change Request**”). Each Change Request shall be submitted in writing and shall, where applicable, include a description of the requested change, rationale, and any relevant technical or operational details.

13.2 **Impact Assessment.**  
Upon receipt of a Change Request from the Client, the Vendor shall perform a reasonable impact assessment and provide the Client with a written response, including:

  a. A description of the impact on scope, timelines, and resources;  
  b. Any proposed adjustments to fees or payment schedules;  
  c. Any modifications to Service Level Targets; and  
  d. Any risks or dependencies associated with the change.

13.3 **Approval Process.**  
No Change Request shall be binding unless and until agreed in writing by both Parties, either by executing an amendment to this Agreement, an updated SOW, or a signed change order. The Vendor shall have no obligation to commence work on any requested change until such written approval is obtained.

13.4 **Deemed Acceptance of Minor Changes.**  
The Vendor may implement minor changes that do not materially alter the scope of Services, Service Level Targets, or fees (e.g., version updates, minor configuration changes) without requiring a formal Change Request, provided that such changes do not adversely affect the functionality of the Services. The Vendor shall notify the Client of such changes as appropriate.

13.5 **Emergency Changes.**  
In the event of an emergency affecting service availability, security, or compliance, the Vendor may implement changes as necessary without prior approval; provided that the Vendor shall notify the Client as soon as practicable and cooperate with the Client to address any resulting issues.

If the Dispute is not resolved within fifteen (15) days, the Dispute shall be escalated to senior management of each Party for further discussions.

The Parties shall share equally the mediator’s fees and expenses, and each Party shall bear its own legal and other costs.

14.3 **Arbitration / Litigation.**  
If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within ninety (90) days after commencement of mediation, either Party may pursue legal remedies as follows:

  a. Any Dispute seeking monetary damages in excess of US $500,000 shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall take place in Wilmington, Delaware, before a panel of three (3) arbitrators. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  
  b. Any Dispute seeking injunctive or equitable relief, or involving claims of misuse or infringement of Intellectual Property Rights, may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware, and the Parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

14.4 **Confidentiality of Proceedings.**  
All negotiations, mediations, and arbitration proceedings related to a Dispute shall be confidential and shall be treated as settlement negotiations, and evidence of them shall be inadmissible in any subsequent litigation or arbitration, to the maximum extent permitted by law.

14.5 **Continued Performance.**  
During the pendency of any Dispute, and to the extent practicable, the Parties shall continue to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.

  c. Keep the other Party reasonably informed of the status and expected duration of the Force Majeure Event.

15.3 **Suspension of Performance.**  
The obligations of the affected Party shall be suspended to the extent and for the duration of the Force Majeure Event, provided that the affected Party continues to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform such obligations to the extent not impacted by the Force Majeure Event.
