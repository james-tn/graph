12.1 **Incorporation of Parent Data Protection Provisions.**  
The data protection obligations set forth in **Article XI (Data Protection and Privacy)** of the Parent Agreement are incorporated by reference and apply fully to this Amendment. The roles of the Parties (Contoso as data controller and Delta as data processor) under **Section 11.2** of the Parent Agreement remain unchanged.

12.2 **Scope of Processing for Additional Quantities.**  
To the extent that the Additional Quantities involve increased processing of Personal Data (e.g., through expanded monitoring of endpoints, additional logs, or new supported sites), such processing shall be within the scope and purposes described in the existing data processing arrangements under the Parent Agreement and any applicable SOWs, as may be further detailed in Schedule 1 or a separate data processing annex, if required by law.

12.3 **Security Measures and Breach Notification.**  
Delta shall ensure that its technical and organisational measures (as required under **Section 11.4** of the Parent Agreement) remain adequate and appropriately scaled to address the increased volume or sensitivity of Personal Data processed in connection with the Additional Quantities. The breach notification procedures under **Section 11.6** of the Parent Agreement continue to apply.

12.4 **Retention and Deletion.**  
Data retention and deletion obligations under **Section 11.9 of the Parent Agreement** apply equally to any Personal Data processed under this Amendment. Upon termination or expiry of this Amendment, relevant Personal Data shall be returned or deleted in accordance with Contoso’s instructions and applicable law.
