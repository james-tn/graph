## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.**  
For the purposes of this Agreement and Data Protection Laws, Contoso is the Controller (or “business” under CCPA/CPRA) and Horizon is the Processor (or “service provider” under CCPA/CPRA) with respect to the Processing of Personal Data.

11.2 **Processing on Documented Instructions.**  
Horizon shall Process Personal Data only on Contoso’s Documented Instructions, as set forth in this DPA, the Master Agreement, applicable SOWs, and any written instructions reasonably agreed by the Parties. If Horizon believes that an Instruction conflicts with Data Protection Laws, Horizon shall promptly notify Contoso.

11.3 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with Data Protection Laws applicable to it in the context of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing:

  (a) Horizon shall, where directly applicable to Horizon as a Processor or service provider, comply with GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, and similar laws with respect to its Processing of Personal Data on behalf of Contoso; and  

  (b) Contoso shall be responsible for ensuring that it has all necessary consents, notices, and legal bases for the Processing of Personal Data by Horizon.

11.4 **Security Measures.**  
Horizon shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, as appropriate:

  (a) encryption of Personal Data in transit over public networks and at rest where feasible;  

  (b) access controls based on the principle of least privilege;  

  (c) regular vulnerability assessments and patch management;  

  (d) physical security controls at data centers and facilities;  

  (e) business continuity and disaster recovery procedures; and

11.5 **Sub-Processors.**  
Contoso hereby authorizes Horizon to engage Sub-Processors to Process Personal Data, provided that:

  (a) Horizon shall maintain a list of current Sub-Processors and make such list available to Contoso upon request;  

  (b) Horizon shall require Sub-Processors to be bound by written data processing terms that are no less protective than those set forth in this DPA; and  

  (c) Horizon shall remain liable to Contoso for the performance of its Sub-Processors’ obligations under such agreements.

11.6 **Audit and Inspection Rights.**  
Upon Contoso’s reasonable written request no more than once annually, and subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations and scheduling, Horizon shall:

  (a) provide Contoso with applicable third-party security or compliance reports (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001 certificate) or other documentation sufficient to demonstrate Horizon’s compliance with this DPA; and  

  (b) allow for a reasonable audit by Contoso or its designated auditor (not being a competitor of Horizon) of Horizon’s relevant facilities and records related to the Processing of Personal Data, provided that such audit (i) is conducted during normal business hours; (ii) does not unreasonably interfere with Horizon’s operations; (iii) is subject to prior written notice of at least thirty (30) days; and (iv) is limited to once every twelve (12) months, unless required by a supervisory authority or following a confirmed Security Incident.

11.7 **Data Subject Requests.**  
Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Horizon shall assist Contoso by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as possible, in fulfilling Contoso’s obligations to respond to requests from Data Subjects to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (such as access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, or objection). Horizon shall promptly notify Contoso if it receives a direct request from a Data Subject relating to Personal Data and shall not respond except on Contoso’s documented instructions or as required by law.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Horizon shall retain Personal Data only for the duration necessary to provide the Services and fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, or as required by Applicable Law.

  (b) provide Contoso with reasonable information available to Horizon regarding the nature of the incident, the categories and approximate number of Data Subjects and records concerned, the likely consequences, and measures taken or proposed to be taken to mitigate possible adverse effects; and  

  (c) cooperate with Contoso in good faith to investigate, mitigate, and remediate the Security Incident, and to comply with any notification obligations to supervisory authorities or affected Data Subjects as required under Data Protection Laws, provided that Contoso shall retain responsibility for making such notifications unless otherwise agreed or required by law.

11.10 **International Data Transfers.**  
To the extent Personal Data subject to GDPR, UK GDPR, or similar laws is transferred by Contoso to Horizon in a third country that does not ensure an adequate level of protection, the Parties shall implement appropriate safeguards, such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses or the UK International Data Transfer Addendum, as applicable. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to execute any additional documentation required to legitimize such cross-border transfers.
