(c) provide reasonable cooperation and assistance, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, in the defense and settlement of the Claim.

8.4 **IP Infringement Remedies.**  
In the event of any Claim alleging that the Deliverables or Vendor Materials infringe third-party Intellectual Property Rights, Vendor may, at its option and expense:  
(a) procure for Client the right to continue using the allegedly infringing Deliverables or Vendor Materials;  
(b) modify the Deliverables or Vendor Materials so that they become non-infringing while retaining substantially equivalent functionality; or  
(c) replace the Deliverables or Vendor Materials with non-infringing items of substantially equivalent functionality.  

If none of the foregoing options is commercially reasonable, Vendor may terminate the affected SOW and refund to Client any prepaid, unused Fees for the impacted Deliverables or Services, which shall be Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for such infringement claim, subject to Vendor’s indemnity obligations under Section 8.1.

## ARTICLE IX  
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **High-Risk Engagement – No Cap on Liability.**  
IN LIGHT OF THE PARTIES’ EXPRESS RECOGNITION OF THE HIGH-RISK NATURE OF THE ENGAGEMENT DESCRIBED HEREIN (SEE SECTION 2.8), AND IN CONSIDERATION OF THE FEES AND OTHER TERMS NEGOTIATED BY THE PARTIES, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IX, THERE SHALL BE **NO CONTRACTUAL CAP** ON EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY’S LIABILITY MAY INCLUDE, AND IS NOT EXCLUDED WITH RESPECT TO, ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR LOSS OF DATA), WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES, OR THE DELIVERABLES, EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE OR THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  

The foregoing is a deliberate departure from standard exclusions of consequential damages, reflecting the High Risk designation and the Parties’ negotiated allocation of risks.
