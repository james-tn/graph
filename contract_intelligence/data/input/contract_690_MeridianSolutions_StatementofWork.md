8.4 **Mitigation for IP Infringement.**

  (b) replace or modify the Work Product so that it becomes non-infringing while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or  
  (c) if (a) and (b) are not commercially reasonable, terminate the license to the affected Work Product and refund to Client the portion of fees paid by Client allocable to the affected Work Product, depreciated on a straight-line basis over a three (3) year period from acceptance.

8.5 **Exclusions.**  
Service Provider’s obligations under Section 8.1(a) shall not apply to the extent the alleged infringement arises from:  
  (a) modifications to the Work Product made by or on behalf of Client without Service Provider’s authorization;  
  (b) combination or use of the Work Product with materials, software, or systems not supplied or approved in writing by Service Provider; or
