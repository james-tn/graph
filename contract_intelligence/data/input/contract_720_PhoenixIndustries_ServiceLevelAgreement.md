Phoenix shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the core production environment for the Services (excluding scheduled maintenance) achieves a minimum monthly uptime percentage of **99.9%** (“Availability SLA”). Uptime shall be calculated as:

> Uptime % = (Total Minutes in Month – Unscheduled Downtime) / (Total Minutes in Month) × 100

12.2 **Scheduled Maintenance.**  
Phoenix may perform Scheduled Maintenance during non-peak hours as reasonably determined by Phoenix. Phoenix shall provide Contoso with at least five (5) Business Days’ prior notice of Scheduled Maintenance that is expected to cause material downtime. Scheduled Maintenance of up to four (4) hours per month shall not count as downtime for purposes of uptime calculation.

12.3 **Incident Response and Resolution.**  

Phoenix shall adhere to the following target response and resolution times:

- **Severity 3 (Medium)** – Limited impact, non-critical failure:
  - Initial response: within 4 Business Hours

- Uptime between 98.0% and 99.0%: 10% credit  
- Uptime below 98.0%: 15% credit

Service Credits shall be applied against the next invoice(s) issued to Contoso. Service Credits are Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for breaches of the Availability SLA, without limiting Contoso’s right to terminate for chronic SLA failures under Section 4.5.

12.5 **SLA Exclusions.**  
SLA calculations shall exclude downtime or performance issues caused by: (a) Contoso’s or its third-party vendors’ hardware, software, networks, or systems not managed by Phoenix; (b) misuse or unauthorized use of the Services by Contoso; (c) Scheduled Maintenance and emergency maintenance (where Phoenix has used reasonable efforts to notify Contoso); and (d) Force Majeure Events as described in Article XV.
