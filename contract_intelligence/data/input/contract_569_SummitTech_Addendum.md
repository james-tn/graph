  2.2.1 **Discovery and Requirements Phase.** Summit Tech shall conduct discovery workshops with designated Contoso stakeholders to identify business requirements, technical constraints, integration points, and security and compliance needs. Summit Tech shall prepare a **Requirements Specification** document outlining functional and non-functional requirements, dependencies, assumptions, and acceptance criteria. Contoso shall review and approve the Requirements Specification in writing, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  2.2.2 **Design and Architecture Phase.** Based on the approved Requirements Specification, Summit Tech shall produce a **Solution Design Document**, including architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, integration points, security controls, user roles and permissions, and high-level configuration details. Summit Tech shall also propose an implementation timeline, resource plan, and indicative cutover strategy. Contoso shall provide timely feedback and approvals as reasonably requested.

  2.2.3 **Implementation and Configuration Phase.** Summit Tech shall configure its platform and related components to meet the approved Solution Design. Activities shall include set-up of environments (development, staging, production), configuration of modules, mapping of data fields, integration development, and implementation of security controls. Summit Tech shall adhere to industry-standard practices for change control, version management, and documentation.

  2.2.4 **Data Migration and Testing Phase.** Summit Tech shall assist Contoso with data extraction, transformation, loading, and validation. Summit Tech shall develop test plans, test cases, and scripts to validate functionality, performance, and security. The Parties shall jointly conduct unit testing, system integration testing, and user acceptance testing (“UAT”). Summit Tech shall remediate material defects identified during testing within mutually agreed timeframes.

  2.2.5 **Go-Live and Stabilization Phase.** Upon successful completion of UAT and Contoso’s written go-live authorization, Summit Tech shall support cutover to the production environment. Summit Tech shall provide enhanced support during the initial stabilization period, including rapid response to critical issues, monitoring key performance indicators, and fine-tuning configurations as needed.

  2.2.6 **Ongoing Support and Maintenance Phase.** Following stabilization, Summit Tech shall provide ongoing support, maintenance, monitoring, and optimization in accordance with the Service Levels (Article XII). Such Services may include incident management, problem management, routine maintenance, patching, and minor enhancements as specified in the applicable SOW.

  (d) Configuration documentation and system configuration files;  
  (e) Integration specifications and code snippets (if contractually agreed);  
  (f) Test plans, test cases, and test results summary;  
  (g) Training materials and user guides;  
  (h) Go-live readiness checklist and cutover plan; and  
  (i) Operational runbooks and support procedures.

Each Deliverable shall be provided in a mutually agreed format (e.g., electronic, PDF, or native format) and shall be deemed accepted when Contoso provides written acceptance or fails to reject the Deliverable within ten (10) Business Days of delivery, stating in reasonable detail the basis for rejection.

2.5 **Timelines and Milestones.** The Parties shall mutually agree upon the Project Plan, including detailed milestones and target completion dates. While certain milestones may be designated as “target” or “soft” dates, any critical milestone expressly identified in an SOW or the Project Plan as a “firm” or “binding” date shall be subject to the Service Levels and remedies described in Article XII and Article III (including potential fee adjustments or Service Credits, as applicable). The Parties acknowledge that timely completion of milestones is dependent on:

  (e) maintain appropriate backup and disaster recovery processes for its own systems, except to the extent explicitly included in the Services.

Summit Tech shall not be responsible for delays or failures to meet deadlines or Service Levels caused by Contoso’s failure to perform its responsibilities, provided Summit Tech has notified Contoso in writing and used commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any resulting impact.

2.7 **Subcontractors.** Summit Tech may use subcontractors to perform portions of the Services, provided that (a) Summit Tech remains fully responsible for the acts and omissions of its subcontractors, (b) subcontractors are bound by written obligations of confidentiality, data protection, and security no less protective than those set forth herein, and (c) Summit Tech shall not subcontract any material portion of the Services to a direct competitor of Contoso without Contoso’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

  (b) granting the indemnifying Party sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim, provided that the indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim in a manner that imposes any admission of wrongdoing, liability, or non-monetary obligations on the indemnified Party without the indemnified Party’s prior written consent; and  
  (c) providing the indemnifying Party with reasonable cooperation and assistance at the indemnifying Party’s expense.

8.4 **Mitigation for IP Claims.** If the Services, Deliverables, or Work Product become, or in Summit Tech’s reasonable opinion are likely to become, the subject of an IP infringement Claim, Summit Tech may, at its sole option and expense: (a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using the Services or Deliverables; (b) modify the Services or Deliverables so that they become non-infringing, provided such modification does not materially degrade functionality; or (c) replace the Services or Deliverables with a functionally equivalent non-infringing alternative. If none of the foregoing options is commercially reasonable, Summit Tech may terminate the affected Services or Deliverables and refund to Contoso any prepaid fees for the unused portion of the Term for such Services or Deliverables.

8.5 **Exclusions.** Summit Tech shall have no liability under Section 8.1(a) to the extent that an infringement or misappropriation Claim arises from:

  (a) Contoso’s modification of the Deliverables or Work Product not authorized by Summit Tech;  
  (b) combination of the Deliverables or Work Product with products, services, or data not provided or approved by Summit Tech;  
  (c) use of the Deliverables or Work Product in a manner not contemplated by this Addendum; or  
  (d) compliance by Summit Tech with Contoso’s specific written instructions, where such compliance is the cause of the infringement.

8.6 **Exclusive Remedy.** This Article VIII sets forth each Party’s sole and exclusive obligations, and the other Party’s sole and exclusive remedies, with respect to any third-party Intellectual Property infringement Claims, without limiting any rights or remedies for other types of Claims expressly provided under this Addendum.
