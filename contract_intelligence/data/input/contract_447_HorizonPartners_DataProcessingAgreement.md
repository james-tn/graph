## ARTICLE XI – DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Roles of the Parties.**  
For purposes of Applicable Data Protection Laws, the Company shall generally act as Controller and the Service Provider shall act as Processor (or service provider/contractor under CCPA) with respect to Company Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.

11.2 **Processing Instructions.**  
The Service Provider shall process Company Personal Data only (a) on documented instructions from the Company as set forth in this Agreement and the applicable SOWs; (b) as necessary to provide the Services; and (c) as required by applicable law, in which case the Service Provider shall inform the Company of such legal requirement before processing, unless prohibited by law.

11.3 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.**  
Each Party shall comply with its respective obligations under Applicable Data Protection Laws. Without limiting the foregoing:

  (a) The Company shall ensure that it has obtained all necessary consents, provided all necessary notices, and otherwise has a lawful basis for processing Company Personal Data and for engaging the Service Provider as Processor;  
  (b) The Service Provider shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, as appropriate, encryption, pseudonymization, access controls, logging, and regular testing of security measures; and  
  (c) The Service Provider shall provide reasonable assistance to the Company in ensuring compliance with the Company’s obligations regarding security, data protection impact assessments, and consultations with supervisory authorities, to the extent required by Applicable Data Protection Laws.

11.4 **Confidentiality of Personnel.**  
The Service Provider shall ensure that persons authorized to process Company Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality and that such persons process Company Personal Data only on instructions from the Service Provider consistent with this Agreement.

11.5 **Sub-processors.**  
The Company hereby authorizes the Service Provider to engage Sub-processors to process Company Personal Data, provided that:

  (a) The Service Provider enters into a written contract with each Sub-processor imposing data protection obligations no less protective than those set out in this Agreement;  
  (b) The Service Provider remains fully liable to the Company for the performance of each Sub-processor’s obligations; and  
  (c) The Service Provider maintains an up-to-date list of Sub-processors and shall provide such list to the Company upon request. Where required by Applicable Data Protection Laws, the Service Provider shall notify the Company of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of Sub-processors, thereby giving the Company the opportunity to object on reasonable, data protection–related grounds.

11.6 **International Transfers.**  
To the extent the Service Provider or any Sub-processor transfers Company Personal Data outside the jurisdiction in which it was originally collected (e.g., outside the EEA, UK, or Singapore), the Service Provider shall ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with Applicable Data Protection Laws, including, where applicable, by entering into standard contractual clauses or other legally approved transfer mechanisms. The Service Provider shall make copies of such transfer mechanisms available to the Company upon request, subject to reasonable redactions.

11.7 **Data Subject Rights.**  
Taking into account the nature of the processing, the Service Provider shall assist the Company, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, to respond to requests from Data Subjects to exercise their rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws (e.g., access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection). If the Service Provider receives a request directly from a Data Subject relating to Company Personal Data, it shall promptly notify the Company and shall not respond to the request except as instructed by the Company, unless otherwise required by law.

11.8 **Data Breach Notification.**  
In the event of a Data Breach affecting Company Personal Data, the Service Provider shall:

  (a) Notify the Company without undue delay and, where feasible, within forty-eight (48) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  
  (b) Provide the Company with information reasonably available at the time to assist the Company in meeting its reporting obligations, including, where possible: (i) the nature of the Data Breach, including categories and approximate number of Data Subjects and data records affected; (ii) the likely consequences; and (iii) measures taken or proposed to address the Data Breach; and  
  (c) Cooperate with the Company and take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any adverse effects of the Data Breach and to prevent its recurrence.

11.9 **Data Retention and Deletion.**  
Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or upon the Company’s written request at any time, the Service Provider shall, at the Company’s option and subject to applicable law:

  (a) Return all Company Personal Data and other Company Data to the Company in a commonly used, machine-readable format; or  
  (b) Securely delete or anonymize all Company Personal Data and other Company Data, except to the extent the Service Provider is required by law to retain such data, in which case the Service Provider shall continue to protect such data in accordance with this Agreement.

11.10 **CCPA Terms (Service Provider/Contractor).**  
To the extent CCPA applies, the Parties agree that the Service Provider shall act as a “service provider” and/or “contractor” as such terms are defined under CCPA, and:

  (a) The Service Provider shall not sell or share (as defined under CCPA) Company Personal Data;  
  (b) The Service Provider shall not retain, use, or disclose Company Personal Data for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of providing the Services to the Company, or as otherwise permitted by CCPA; and  
  (c) The Service Provider shall not combine Company Personal Data with personal information that it receives from or on behalf of another person or from its own interactions with a consumer, except as permitted by CCPA.
