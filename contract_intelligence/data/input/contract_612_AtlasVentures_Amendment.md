2.2 **Additional License Scope.**  
(a) **Expanded Authorized Users.** In addition to the Authorized Users granted access under **Section 2.2 (License Grant)** of the Parent Agreement, Atlas hereby grants Client the right, during the Amendment Term, to provision up to an **additional 600 Authorized Users** across Contoso’s finance, supply chain, and operations business units. These additional Authorized Users shall be subject to the same usage limitations and compliance obligations as set forth in the Parent Agreement, including **Section 6.6 (Restrictions on Use)**.  
(b) **Additional Modules.** Atlas shall enable the following additional modules of the **Atlas Insight Suite** for Client’s use:  
   - Advanced Predictive Analytics Module;  
   - Vendor Risk Scoring Module; and  
   - Workforce Optimization Module.  
These modules are integrated into the Software as defined in **Section 1.18 (Software)** of the Parent Agreement and shall be subject to the License rights and restrictions in **Article VI (Intellectual Property Rights)** of the Parent Agreement, as modified by **Article VI** of this Amendment.  
(c) **Non-Production Environments.** Atlas shall provision one additional staging environment and one additional training sandbox environment for Client’s internal use, in alignment with **Section 2.3(b)(i)** of the Parent Agreement. These environments shall be used solely for testing, training, and quality assurance, and shall not be used for production data processing except as reasonably necessary for testing.

2.3 **Additional Services.**  
Atlas shall perform Additional Services, which extend those described in **Section 2.3 (Implementation and Configuration Services)**, **Section 2.4 (Training Services)**, and **Section 2.6 (Maintenance and Support)** of the Parent Agreement, including:

(a) **Global Rollout Implementation.**  
Atlas shall design and execute a multi-phase global rollout of the newly added modules across Contoso’s North America, EMEA, and APAC operations. This shall include:  
  (i) conducting requirements gathering workshops per region,  
  (ii) designing region-specific workflows and dashboards,  
  (iii) configuring integrations with regional ERP, CRM, and HR systems (e.g., SAP, Salesforce, Workday) consistent with **Section 2.3(b)(iv)** of the Parent Agreement, and  
  (iv) coordinating cutover and go-live activities.

(b) **Data Migration and Enrichment.**  
Building upon the data migration responsibilities outlined in **Section 2.3(c)** of the Parent Agreement, Atlas shall:  
  (i) assist with mapping and migrating historical transactional data relevant to the new modules (minimum three years of historical data per region);  
  (ii) implement data quality and enrichment scripts; and  
  (iii) provide guidance on master data governance, while Client remains responsible for overall data quality and timely provision of data.

(c) **Optimization and Advisory Services.**  
Atlas shall provide ongoing optimization services, including quarterly performance reviews of the Software’s usage and recommendations on configuration improvements, report optimization, and automation opportunities. Such services shall be deemed “professional services” under **Section 3.2(b)** of the Parent Agreement and shall be billable as described in **Article III** of this Amendment.

(d) **Training and Change Management.**  
Supplementing **Section 2.4 (Training Services)** of the Parent Agreement, Atlas shall provide:  
  - Up to twelve (12) remote training sessions annually;  
  - Two (2) on-site training workshops per contract year during the Amendment Term; and  
  - Access for Contoso’s designated “super users” to Atlas’s advanced training curriculum and knowledge base.  
Client shall remain responsible for travel and lodging expenses of its own personnel.

2.4 **Timelines and Project Plan Addendum.**  
(a) The Parties anticipate an implementation and rollout period for the Additional Services of approximately **nine (9) months** from the Amendment Effective Date for full go-live of the added modules across all regions, subject to Client’s timely cooperation consistent with **Section 2.7 (Client Responsibilities)** of the Parent Agreement.  
(b) Within thirty (30) days after the Amendment Effective Date, the Parties shall mutually finalize the **Project Plan Addendum**, which shall include key milestones, deliverables, dependencies, and resource assignments. The Project Plan Addendum shall be attached to one or more New SOWs and shall be governed by **Article XIII (Change Management)** of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment.

2.5 **Performance Standards.**  
(a) Atlas shall perform the Additional Services in a professional and workmanlike manner, consistent with **Section 2.8 (Performance Standards)** and **Section 7.4 (Services Warranty)** of the Parent Agreement.  
(b) Given the increased complexity and high-risk nature of the expanded scope, Client acknowledges that certain target dates are estimates and not strict deadlines, and that delays caused by Client, third-party vendors, or Force Majeure Events (as defined in **Article XV** of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment) may result in corresponding adjustments to timelines.  
(c) Persistent failure by Atlas to materially achieve major milestones in the Project Plan Addendum, not caused by Client or Force Majeure Events and not cured within a reasonable period following written notice, may constitute a material breach under **Section 4.4(a) (Material Breach)** of the Parent Agreement.

2.6 **Hosting and Access; Security Enhancements.**  
(a) Hosting shall continue to be provided in a secure cloud environment in accordance with **Section 2.5 (Hosting and Access)** and **Article XII (Service Level Agreements)** of the Parent Agreement.  
(b) As part of the Security Enhancements, Atlas shall, during the Amendment Term:  
  - Provide Client with quarterly security posture reports summarizing penetration testing results and vulnerability remediation; and  
  - Support Client’s annual security audits by making documentation reasonably available, subject to confidentiality restrictions under **Article V** of the Parent Agreement and this Amendment.

2.7 **Relationship to Existing SOWs and New SOWs.**  
The Additional Services described herein may be further detailed in one or more New SOWs that expressly reference the Parent Agreement and this Amendment. In the event of any conflict between this Amendment and an existing SOW executed under the Parent Agreement prior to the Amendment Effective Date, this Amendment shall prevail with respect to the Additional Services and Additional License Scope only, unless such SOW expressly states that it supersedes conflicting terms in this Amendment.

9.5 **Exceptions.**  
The exceptions set forth in **Section 9.3 (Exceptions to Limitations)** of the Parent Agreement remain applicable, including for confidentiality breaches, indemnification obligations, payment obligations, gross negligence, willful misconduct, and violation of license restrictions.
