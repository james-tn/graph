The structure is defined by the interplay between the main confidentiality provisions, permitted disclosure conditions, survival obligations, exclusions, and jurisdictional requirements, all of which are interconnected through specific rights, obligations, and exceptions. The relationships among these entities ensure robust legal compliance, technical safeguards, and extended protection for sensitive information, including trade secrets and personal data, under applicable data protection laws.\",\"rating\":8.5,\"rating_explanation\":\"The impact severity rating is high due to the critical role these confidentiality provisions play in legal compliance, data protection, and risk management for organizations handling sensitive information.\",\"findings\":[{\"summary\":\"Comprehensive Scope of the Confidentiality Article (Article V)\",\"explanation\":\"The 'Confidentiality Article' (Article V) serves as the cornerstone of this community, providing a detailed definition of 'Confidential Information' and establishing the obligations, exceptions, and remedies related to its handling. It specifies procedures for permitted and compelled disclosures, requirements for the return or destruction of confidential materials, and remedies for breaches, including injunctive and equitable relief. The article also ensures that confidentiality obligations survive the termination or expiration of the agreement, thereby offering extended protection for sensitive information. This comprehensive approach is supported by multiple relationships that link the article to key concepts such as exclusions, rights to retain copies, and legal or regulatory requirements [Data: Entities (659); Relationships (920, 7223, 930, 931, 932, 933, 10020, 10023, 10026, +more)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Permitted Disclosure Conditions and Legal Compliance\",\"explanation\":\"The 'Permitted Disclosure Condition' entity outlines the specific circumstances under which confidential information may be disclosed, such as to authorized individuals or when required by law, regulation, or court order. These conditions are governed by the relevant jurisdiction, which establishes the legal framework for such disclosures. The Receiving Party must adhere to safeguards, including notice and cooperation obligations, to ensure that disclosures are made only to authorized persons and that confidentiality is maintained. This legal compliance is reinforced by relationships that connect permitted disclosure conditions to jurisdictional requirements and procedural safeguards [Data: Entities (1654); Relationships (2754, 682, 681)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Survival of Confidentiality Obligations Beyond Agreement Term\",\"explanation\":\"Confidentiality and non-use obligations persist for five years following the disclosure of confidential information or the termination/expiration of the agreement, as specified in Clause 5.5. For trade secrets and personal data, these obligations continue for a longer period, specifically as long as the information remains a trade secret or as required by applicable law for personal data. This extended protection is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information and is governed by applicable data protection laws and survival period clauses. The relationships highlight the ongoing nature of these obligations and their legal underpinnings [Data: Entities (2718, 6433, 2728, 2729, 4188); Relationships (4930, 4931, 4932, 7679, 12676)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Exclusions from Confidential Information\",\"explanation\":\"Not all information is considered confidential under the agreement. Exclusions include information that is publicly available, already known prior to disclosure, obtained from third-party sources, or independently developed. These exclusions are defined within the Confidentiality Article and further detailed in Section 5.3, which lists exceptions to the definition and obligations regarding confidential information. Understanding these exclusions is essential for determining the scope of protection and the applicability of confidentiality obligations [Data: Entities (3914, 704); Relationships (7223, 1584)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Rights to Retain Archival and Backup Copies\",\"explanation\":\"The Confidentiality Article grants the Receiving Party the right to retain one archival copy of confidential information solely for monitoring rights and obligations, as well as the right to retain information stored in routine computer backup systems, subject to ongoing confidentiality obligations. These rights ensure that organizations can maintain necessary records for compliance and monitoring purposes while still upholding confidentiality requirements. The relationships between the article and these rights underscore the balance between operational needs and legal safeguards [Data: Entities (679, 680); Relationships (930, 931)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Obligation to Use Confidential Information Solely for Agreement Purposes\",\"explanation\":\"The Receiving Party is obligated to use confidential information only as necessary to perform obligations or exercise rights under the agreement. This restriction limits the potential misuse of sensitive information and reinforces the purpose-driven nature of confidentiality provisions. The relationship between the Confidentiality Article and this obligation highlights the importance of restricting the use of confidential information to legitimate, contractually defined activities [Data: Entities (5167); Relationships (10020)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Obligation to Bind Recipients to Confidentiality\",\"explanation\":\"The Receiving Party must ensure that employees, contractors, and advisors who receive confidential information are bound by confidentiality obligations that are no less protective than those in the agreement. This requirement extends the scope of confidentiality protections to all individuals who may access sensitive information, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized disclosure. The relationship between the Confidentiality Article and this obligation emphasizes the need for comprehensive internal controls [Data: Entities (5166); Relationships (10023)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Procedures for Disclosure Required by Law\",\"explanation\":\"When disclosure of confidential information is required by law, regulation, or court order, the Receiving Party must provide prompt written notice and reasonable cooperation to the Disclosing Party. This procedural safeguard ensures that the Disclosing Party is informed and can take appropriate action to protect its interests. The relationships between the Confidentiality Article, the right to disclose required by law, and the obligation for notice and cooperation illustrate the legal and procedural rigor embedded in the framework [Data: Entities (681, 682); Relationships (932, 933)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Legal and Regulatory Requirements for Disclosure\",\"explanation\":\"The Confidentiality Article addresses the conditions under which the Receiving Party may be compelled to disclose confidential information due to legal or regulatory requirements. These requirements are referenced in the Compelled Disclosure Clause and are governed by the relevant jurisdiction. The relationships highlight the interplay between legal mandates and contractual obligations, ensuring that disclosures are managed in accordance with applicable laws [Data: Entities (5163); Relationships (10026, 2754)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Jurisdictional and Data Protection Law Considerations\",\"explanation\":\"The legal framework governing the treatment of personal data and trade secrets under the agreement is established by the relevant jurisdiction and applicable data protection laws. These laws determine the duration and scope of confidentiality obligations, particularly for sensitive categories of information. The relationships between survival obligations, jurisdictional requirements, and data protection laws underscore the importance of legal compliance and the evolving nature of data protection standards [Data: Entities (4188); Relationships (4930, 7679)].\"}]}", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1427, "prompt_tokens": 4025, "total_tokens": 5452, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 1536, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
