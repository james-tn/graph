This agreement outlines the terms of rent, services, risk allocation, and obligations, ensuring clarity and mutual understanding between the parties.

These risk mitigation strategies are essential for maintaining the integrity of the agreements and protecting the interests of all parties involved [Data: Entities (2130, 3806, 4071, 4530, 4752, 4753, 6968); Relationships (3648, 7026, 7423, 8471, 8942, 8939)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Remedies and Service Credits for Breach\",\n      \"explanation\": \"In the event of a breach or failure to meet service levels, the agreements provide for remedies such as service credits, which are described as the sole and exclusive remedy except in cases of material breach.
