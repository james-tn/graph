This mechanism provides tangible proof that the notice has been received by the intended party, which is essential for legal compliance and dispute resolution. The explicit inclusion of this term in the Notice Clause demonstrates a proactive approach to risk management, reducing the likelihood of claims regarding non-receipt of critical communications.

This method requires not only the use of certified or registered mail services but also mandates that such notices be sent with return receipt requested and prepaid postage. The use of certified or registered mail ensures that the sender has a record of mailing and delivery, which is crucial for legal enforceability.
