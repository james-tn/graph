It requires Acme to obtain and maintain specified insurance coverages, provide certificates of insurance, and clarifies that the existence of insurance does not limit Acme's liability. Vanguard is similarly mandated to maintain specified types and minimum amounts of insurance coverage throughout the agreement term and for one year thereafter. This clause is pivotal in ensuring that both parties uphold their respective insurance responsibilities, thereby reducing exposure to legal and financial risks [Data: Entities (4025); Relationships (7318, 7323)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Professional Indemnity Insurance requirement for Acme\",\"explanation\":\"Article X specifically requires Acme to maintain professional indemnity or errors & omissions insurance. This type of insurance is crucial for protecting Acme against claims arising from professional negligence or mistakes, which could otherwise result in significant financial liabilities. The explicit inclusion of this requirement demonstrates a proactive approach to risk management and legal compliance, safeguarding both Acme and its counterparties from potential disputes and losses [Data: Relationships (7318); Entities (4025)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Notification obligations for material changes in insurance\",\"explanation\":\"A key aspect of Article X is the obligation for Acme to notify Contoso of any material reduction, cancellation, or non-renewal of insurance. This notification requirement ensures transparency and allows Contoso to respond appropriately to changes in risk exposure. Such obligations are essential for maintaining trust and operational continuity, as they provide early warning of potential gaps in coverage that could impact contractual obligations or business operations [Data: Entities (4054); Relationships (7323)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Employers’ Liability Insurance and minimum coverage requirements\",\"explanation\":\"The agreement mandates that Acme maintain employers’ liability insurance with a minimum coverage amount of GBP 10,000,000, or as required by applicable law.

The specification of a minimum amount underscores the importance of robust risk management and compliance with legal standards [Data: Entities (4027, 4036); Relationships (7327)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Vanguard’s ongoing insurance obligations\",\"explanation\":\"Vanguard is required to maintain specified types and minimum amounts of insurance coverage not only during the term of the agreement but also for one year thereafter.
