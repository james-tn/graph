The structure is defined by a network of contractual clauses, severity classifications, and response/resolution obligations that collectively ensure service reliability and business continuity for clients like Contoso. The relationships between incident priority terms, response times, and risk mitigation are governed by detailed service level agreements and support clauses, with a strong emphasis on minimizing service downtime and business outages.

These obligations are codified in clauses like the Incident Response and Resolution Clause and Incident Response Clause, which specify response and resolution targets for each incident category. The obligations ensure that critical incidents receive immediate attention, with response times as short as one hour for Severity 1 (Critical) cases, and resolution or workaround targets within four hours.

Severity 2 (High) and Severity 3 (Medium) incidents have defined response and resolution targets, such as four-hour responses for high-severity issues and one business day for medium-severity cases. Low-severity incidents, such as cosmetic defects or general inquiries, are addressed within two business days and resolved on a commercially reasonable efforts basis.
