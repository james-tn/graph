The Holdover Clause establishes a framework for continued possession, increasing the Base Rent and defining the rights of both parties during the holdover period. The relationships among these entities ensure clarity in rent obligations, tenancy status, and termination procedures, which are critical for both landlords and tenants in managing post-lease scenarios.\",\n  \"rating\": 7.5,\n  \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is high due to the significant financial and legal implications for both landlords and tenants during holdover periods, affecting rent, tenancy rights, and termination procedures.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Holdover Clause establishes post-lease tenancy and rent increase\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Holdover Clause is a pivotal provision that governs the tenant's continued possession of the premises after the expiration or termination of the lease. It automatically converts the tenancy to a month-to-month arrangement and stipulates an increase in the Base Rent to 150% of the original amount, thereby incentivizing timely lease renewal or termination. This mechanism protects the landlord's interests by ensuring higher compensation for extended occupancy and provides a clear legal framework for the tenant's rights and obligations during the holdover period.

The Holdover Clause mandates a 150% increase in Base Rent for month-to-month tenancies, reflecting the increased risk and administrative burden for the landlord. Additionally, Base Rent may be adjusted to fair market value during renewal terms and can be abated as a remedy for service level breaches that impact the tenant’s business. These provisions ensure that rent remains equitable and responsive to changing circumstances, safeguarding both parties' interests.

This arrangement is governed by the same terms as the original lease, except for the increased rent, providing continuity and legal certainty for both parties. The month-to-month tenancy offers flexibility but also subjects the tenant to higher rental costs, encouraging resolution of the tenancy status.

This provision ensures that neither party is indefinitely bound to the arrangement and can plan for transition or re-letting of the premises.
