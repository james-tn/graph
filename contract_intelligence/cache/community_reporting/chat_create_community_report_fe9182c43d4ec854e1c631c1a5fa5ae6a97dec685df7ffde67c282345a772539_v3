The key entities include the risk of service interruption and the specific contractual clause (Section 15.1) that defines and governs Force Majeure Events. Relationships between these entities clarify that service interruption is conditional upon the occurrence of such events, and that the clause provides the legal framework for excusing parties from performance when uncontrollable circumstances arise.
