The core structure revolves around the 'Data Retention and Deletion Clause,' which mandates the responsible retention, return, and deletion of data, subject to exceptions for legal, compliance, and archival purposes. Key relationships are established between clients (such as Contoso) and service providers, with explicit roles as data controllers and processors, and with obligations triggered by contract termination, expiration, or written requests. The community's impact is heightened by the risks of non-compliance, data breaches, and improper retention, as well as the technical and legal mechanisms in place to mitigate these risks. The entities are interlinked through shared obligations for confidentiality, security, and lawful data processing, with additional provisions for data transfers, backup systems, and the use of residual knowledge.
