Key entities include Contoso, which retains ownership of its data, and Atlas, which is granted a limited license to use Contoso Data solely for service provision. The community is structured around contractual clauses and obligations that define the scope of data rights, risks, and mitigation strategies, particularly focusing on Section 6.5 and the risk of unauthorized data use. The relationships are primarily legal and technical, with significant implications for compliance, risk management, and operational integrity.\",\n  \"rating\": 7.5,\n  \"rating_explanation\": \"The impact severity rating is high due to the critical importance of data ownership, licensing, and risk mitigation in contractual and operational contexts between Contoso and Atlas.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Contoso's Retention of Data Ownership\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Contoso retains full ownership of all data, content, or information it supplies and that is processed by the software or services. This foundational right is explicitly affirmed in both the entity description and the contractual relationship, ensuring that Contoso maintains control over its proprietary information. The retention of data ownership is a key legal safeguard for Contoso, protecting its interests and enabling it to dictate terms of use and access. This arrangement is supported by multiple records, including the entity 'RIGHT TO RETAIN DATA OWNERSHIP' and the relationship between Contoso and this right [Data: Entities (4214); Relationships (7704, 7720)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Atlas's Limited License to Use Contoso Data\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Atlas is granted a specific and limited license to use, host, store, transmit, display, and process Contoso Data, but only as necessary to provide services and fulfill its contractual obligations. This license is not a transfer of ownership but a permission strictly bounded by the terms of the agreement.

This obligation acts as a critical compliance mechanism, restricting Atlas's actions and reducing the risk of unauthorized data use.
