The risk of latent defects—flaws not discovered during the initial review period—is also addressed, with clients retaining rights to assert claims for such defects post-acceptance. These risks are managed through contractual mechanisms such as warranty provisions, acceptance procedures, and obligations for vendors to correct nonconformities at no additional cost. The presence of these risks and the associated remedies underscore the importance of robust project management and quality assurance practices [Data: Entities (5577, 6160, 1633, 2613, 616, 3371, 952, 2163, 5829, 5830, 5831, 5832, 6158, 1631, 2160, +more); Relationships (10791, 4743, 2665, 12040, 12041, 12044, 8597, 8097, 9955, 3222, 11427, 11428, 11429, 11430, 11431, 2674, 3756, 12587, +more)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Obligations and Rights of Clients and Vendors\",\"explanation\":\"The contractual landscape defines clear obligations for vendors to deliver, correct, and resubmit deliverables in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) and acceptance criteria. Vendors such as Vanguard, Acme, and Gamma are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy nonconformities and ensure compliance with contractual standards, often at no additional cost to the client. Clients, including Contoso and the Company, have rights to review, test, and reject deliverables, provide feedback, and assert claims for latent defects. They may also accept deficient deliverables with fee reductions or treat persistent nonconformity as a material breach.

Acceptance may be formal (written) or deemed (by expiry of the review period or use in production). If nonconformities are identified, vendors are obligated to correct and resubmit deliverables within agreed timeframes, and clients may provide written notice of material nonconformity. Iteration limits may apply to the correction process, and fee adjustments or termination may be triggered if issues persist. The use of defect logs, test summary reports, and administrative manuals supports the documentation and resolution of nonconformities.
