This clause mandates a comprehensive evaluation of how changes affect scope, fees, timeline, and resources, and obligates the Service Provider to provide a written assessment to the Company. Its presence ensures that all stakeholders are informed of the potential consequences of changes before any approval is granted, thereby reducing the risk of unforeseen disruptions or cost overruns.

This right is a critical control point in the change management process, allowing Contoso to safeguard its interests and ensure that any changes align with strategic objectives and contractual requirements. The relationship between approval and feedback mechanisms reinforces the community’s emphasis on oversight and due diligence [Data: Entities (3307); Relationships (8605)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Interconnected Workflow for Change Management\",\"explanation\":\"The relationships among the 'IMPACT ASSESSMENT CLAUSE', 'WRITTEN IMPACT ASSESSMENT', 'FEEDBACK OR APPROVAL ON DELIVERABLES', and 'APPROVAL' establish a tightly integrated workflow for managing change requests.
