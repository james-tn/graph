These damages encompass a wide range of financial compensation, such as costs, attorneys’ fees, and various forms of consequential losses. However, the data highlights that monetary damages are often considered inadequate, especially in cases of irreparable harm from unauthorized disclosure. This limitation is reflected in the relationship between monetary damages and the risk of irreparable harm, suggesting that equitable relief may be necessary to fully address certain breaches.
