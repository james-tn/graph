[Data: Entities (757); Relationships (992)]\"},{\"summary\":\"Role of Section 7.3 in Mitigating Third-Party Rights Risk\",\"explanation\":\"Section 7.3 of the client contract plays a critical role in addressing the risk of third-party rights breaches. This clause requires the client to make representations and warranties that they possess all necessary rights to grant licenses and that the vendor’s use of client materials will not infringe third-party rights. By formalizing these assurances, Section 7.3 serves as a legal safeguard, shifting responsibility to the client and providing a basis for recourse if a breach occurs. This contractual mechanism is essential for managing risk and ensuring compliance.
