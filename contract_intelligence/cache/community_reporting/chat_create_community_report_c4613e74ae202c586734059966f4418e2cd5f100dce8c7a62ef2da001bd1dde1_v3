The key entities include 'Operating Expenses,' 'Additional Rent Clause,' 'Proportionate Share,' and 'Obligation to Pay Additional Rent.' These entities are interconnected through relationships that define how tenants are required to pay a proportionate share of building expenses, calculated based on the rentable square footage of their premises.

The relationships and clauses described form the backbone of commercial lease agreements, directly impacting the financial responsibilities and legal compliance of both landlords and tenants.\",\"rating\":7.5,\"rating_explanation\":\"The impact severity rating is high due to the significant financial and legal implications these clauses have for both landlords and tenants in commercial real estate.\",\"findings\":[{\"summary\":\"Central Role of Operating Expenses in Lease Agreements\",\"explanation\":\"'Operating Expenses' are a foundational element in commercial lease agreements, encompassing all costs related to the ownership, operation, maintenance, repair, and management of the building and its common areas. These expenses are not only critical for the upkeep and functionality of the property but also directly influence the financial obligations of tenants, as they are included in the calculation of Additional Rent. The explicit connection between Operating Expenses and the Premises highlights the direct impact on tenants occupying the building [Data: Entities (6999); Relationships (13875)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Function and Impact of the Additional Rent Clause\",\"explanation\":\"The 'Additional Rent Clause' is a pivotal legal provision requiring tenants to pay a proportionate share of operating expenses and taxes. This clause ensures that the landlord can recover costs associated with building management and maintenance, distributing these expenses among tenants based on their occupancy. The clause's enforcement creates a binding financial obligation for tenants, which can significantly affect their operational budgets and long-term financial planning [Data: Entities (7050); Relationships (13970, 13973)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Calculation of Tenant's Financial Responsibility via Proportionate Share\",\"explanation\":\"The concept of 'Proportionate Share' is used to determine each tenant's share of operating expenses and taxes. It is calculated as the ratio of the rentable square footage of the tenant's premises to the total rentable square footage of the building. This method ensures an equitable distribution of costs, aligning each tenant's financial responsibility with the size of their leased space. The relationship between Proportionate Share and Operating Expenses is crucial for transparency and fairness in commercial leasing [Data: Entities (7051); Relationships (13974)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Legal Obligation to Pay Additional Rent\",\"explanation\":\"Tenants are legally obligated to pay a proportionate share of operating expenses and taxes as Additional Rent, as determined by the landlord.
