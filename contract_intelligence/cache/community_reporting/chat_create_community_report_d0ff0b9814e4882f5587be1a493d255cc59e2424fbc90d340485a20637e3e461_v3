The clause establishes incident priority levels, such as 'PRIORITY 1 (CRITICAL)' and 'PRIORITY 3 (MEDIUM/LOW),' and sets specific target response and resolution times for each. Key entities include obligations to respond to incidents, commercially reasonable efforts to resolve them, and the mitigation of system outage risks. The relationships among these entities ensure that service quality and reliability are maintained, with Atlas's obligations and defined terms like 'SERVICE INCIDENT' and 'TARGET RESOLUTION TIME' playing crucial roles in the community's structure and compliance.\",\"rating\":8.5,\"rating_explanation\":\"The impact severity rating is high due to the clause's central role in ensuring business continuity, mitigating critical risks, and enforcing service reliability standards.\",\"findings\":[{\"summary\":\"Central Role of the Response and Resolution Times Clause\",\"explanation\":\"The 'RESPONSE AND RESOLUTION TIMES CLAUSE' is the foundational entity in this community, defining the obligations of service providers to respond to and resolve incidents based on their severity.
