The clause grants the Client a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual license to use, reproduce, and internally modify Deliverables, contingent upon full payment of all fees and expenses. Additionally, Clause 6.2.2 explicitly prohibits service bureau use of Deliverables unless such use is specifically authorized in a Statement of Work (SOW). These relationships establish the legal and operational boundaries for the Client's use of Deliverables, with significant implications for compliance, technical deployment, and risk management.\",\"rating\":7.5,\"rating_explanation\":\"The impact severity rating is high due to the clause's central role in defining legal rights, obligations, and restrictions that directly affect the Client's ability to use and deploy Deliverables.\",\"findings\":[{\"summary\":\"Clause 6.2.2 as the foundational licensing provision\",\"explanation\":\"Clause 6.2.2 is the key contractual provision governing the Client's rights to use Deliverables. It provides a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual license, but only upon full payment. This structure ensures that the Client has broad rights to utilize and internally modify Deliverables, but only after fulfilling all financial obligations. The perpetual nature of the license means the Client retains these rights indefinitely, which is significant for long-term planning and operational stability. [Data: Entities (1352); Relationships (2165)]\"},{\"summary\":\"Obligation to pay fees as a prerequisite for license rights\",\"explanation\":\"The license rights granted under Clause 6.2.2 are contingent upon the Client's payment of all fees and expenses. This creates a direct legal and financial obligation, making compliance with payment terms essential for the Client to secure and maintain their license. Failure to meet these obligations could result in loss of rights or exposure to legal claims, underscoring the importance of robust financial controls and contract management. [Data: Relationships (2165)]\"},{\"summary\":\"Prohibition of service bureau use without explicit authorization\",\"explanation\":\"Clause 6.2.2 specifically prohibits the Client from using Deliverables for service bureau purposes unless such use is explicitly authorized in a Statement of Work (SOW). Service bureau use typically involves providing services to third parties using the Deliverables, which could pose risks related to intellectual property, liability, and compliance. By restricting this type of use, the clause protects the provider's interests and ensures that any expansion of use is subject to additional negotiation and agreement. [Data: Entities (1372); Relationships (2169)]\"},{\"summary\":\"Technical capabilities limited to internal use and modification\",\"explanation\":\"The license granted by Clause 6.2.2 allows the Client to use, reproduce, and internally modify Deliverables, but does not extend to external distribution or third-party use. This limitation shapes the technical deployment of Deliverables, requiring the Client to maintain usage within their own organization unless further rights are negotiated. Such restrictions are common in software and technology contracts to safeguard proprietary technology and control downstream risks. [Data: Entities (1352); Relationships (2169)]\"},{\"summary\":\"Legal compliance risks associated with unauthorized service bureau use\",\"explanation\":\"Unauthorized service bureau use of Deliverables could expose the Client to significant legal risks, including breach of contract and potential damages. Clause 6.2.2's explicit prohibition serves as a clear compliance boundary, and any deviation from this requirement must be carefully managed through formal amendments or SOWs. Clients must ensure that all internal stakeholders are aware of these restrictions to avoid inadvertent violations.
