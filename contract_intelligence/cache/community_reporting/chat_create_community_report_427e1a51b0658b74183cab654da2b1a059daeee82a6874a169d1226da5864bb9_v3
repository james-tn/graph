The central focus is on the maintenance of specified insurance coverage, particularly Professional Liability/Errors and Omissions Insurance, and the legal provisions that ensure these requirements do not limit the parties’ broader obligations or liabilities under the agreement.

This article is directly linked to the Insurance Coverage Clause, which details the types and limits of required insurance, ensuring that all parties are aware of their obligations and the standards to be met. The explicit connection between the Insurance Article and the Insurance Coverage Clause establishes a clear legal framework for risk mitigation and contractual compliance [Data: Entities (3452); Relationships (6383)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Professional Liability/Errors and Omissions Insurance as a Key Requirement\",\"explanation\":\"Professional Liability/Errors and Omissions Insurance is specifically required under the Insurance Coverage Clause, with minimum limits of US$2,000,000 per claim and in the aggregate. This requirement is designed to protect against liabilities arising from the provision of services, ensuring that Acme and other service providers are financially equipped to address potential claims.

This clause, often referenced in sections such as Clause 10.3 and Section 10.4, ensures that entities like Acme and Gamma remain fully responsible for their contractual obligations, regardless of the existence or extent of insurance coverage. The relationship between the No Limitation Clause and the Obligation to Maintain Insurance reinforces this principle, safeguarding the interests of all parties [Data: Entities (2029); Relationships (3484)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Obligation to Maintain Insurance Extends Beyond Contract Term\",\"explanation\":\"The Obligation to Maintain Insurance requires entities such as Acme, Gamma, Service Providers, and Vendors to maintain specified insurance policies not only during the term of the agreement but also for at least one year thereafter. This extended obligation ensures ongoing protection against potential claims that may arise after the contract has ended, providing a safety net for all parties involved. The detailed requirements for maintaining insurance, including the types and limits, are outlined in the agreement and referenced in Article X [Data: Entities (2034, 3452)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Interconnected Clauses Create a Comprehensive Risk Management Framework\",\"explanation\":\"The relationships among the Insurance Article, Insurance Coverage Clause, No Limitation Clause, and Obligation to Maintain Insurance form a tightly integrated framework for managing contractual risk.
