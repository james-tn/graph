These definitions ensure that the Agreement aligns with relevant statutes and regulations, particularly in areas such as data protection and confidentiality. This mitigates legal risks and supports the parties in adhering to regulatory requirements, which is essential for contracts involving sensitive information or cross-jurisdictional operations [Data: Entities (5647, 5650, 5652, 5659); Relationships (11012, 11015, 11017, 11024)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Technical and operational precision\",\"explanation\":\"Definitions of terms like 'Business Day,' 'Change Order,' 'Deliverables,' and 'Contract Price' provide the technical and operational backbone for the Agreement.
