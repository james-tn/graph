This clause establishes the PO as a central document for initiating and formalizing transactions, ensuring clarity and mutual agreement on the terms. The PO's role in specifying both the items and the financial terms is critical for legal compliance and operational efficiency [Data: Entities (31); Relationships (64)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Definition and Role of Statements of Work\",\"explanation\":\"Clause 1.18 defines 'Statement of Work' (SOW) as a written document executed by both parties, describing specific services and/or deliverables to be provided by Acme to Contoso. The SOW includes scope, milestones, timelines, responsibilities, and applicable fees, making it essential for project management and accountability.
