The entities are bound by a comprehensive agreement that establishes Contoso’s ownership of work product, Gamma’s responsibilities for data protection and privacy, and detailed procedures for incident response and remediation. The structure is defined by clear roles, rights, and obligations, with significant emphasis on compliance with GDPR and CCPA, risk mitigation, and technical service commitments.

This framework defines the roles of Contoso as the controller and Gamma as the processor, and sets forth obligations for processing, protecting, and retaining personal data. It also establishes procedures for data breach notification, data subject rights, and the use of subprocessors, ensuring that both parties adhere to stringent legal requirements.

Additionally, Gamma grants Contoso a perpetual, royalty-free license to use Gamma’s pre-existing IP as integrated into deliverables, while Contoso provides Gamma a limited license to use work product solely for service performance.
