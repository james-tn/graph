The structure is defined by the requirement that both parties equally share the mediator’s fees and general mediation expenses, while each party remains individually responsible for their own attorney’s fees and related legal costs. The relationships between these entities clarify the boundaries of shared and individual financial responsibilities during dispute resolution, ensuring transparency and fairness in cost allocation.\",\"rating\":6.5,\"rating_explanation\":\"The impact severity rating is above moderate due to the direct influence these provisions have on legal compliance, financial planning, and dispute resolution outcomes for involved parties.\",\"findings\":[{\"summary\":\"Clear division of mediation and legal costs\",\"explanation\":\"The community is anchored by the explicit separation between shared mediation costs and individual attorney’s fees. The 'Obligation to Share Mediation Costs' mandates equal sharing of mediator’s fees and general mediation expenses, but specifically excludes each party’s own legal representation costs, which are covered individually. This clear delineation helps prevent disputes over cost allocation and ensures that parties are aware of their financial responsibilities during mediation.

This ensures that both parties are equally invested in the process and that the financial burden of mediation is not disproportionately placed on one party. The exclusion of attorney’s fees from shared costs further reinforces the principle that legal representation is a personal choice and responsibility. [Data: Relationships (2395)]\"},{\"summary\":\"Legal compliance and transparency\",\"explanation\":\"By clearly defining which costs are shared and which are borne individually, these provisions promote legal compliance and transparency. Parties entering mediation are provided with a straightforward framework for cost allocation, reducing the risk of misunderstandings or non-compliance. This clarity is essential for upholding the integrity of the dispute resolution process and protecting the interests of all parties involved. [Data: Entities (1472, 1830); Relationships (2395, 3063)]\"},{\"summary\":\"Financial planning implications for parties\",\"explanation\":\"The distinction between shared and individual costs has significant implications for financial planning. Parties must budget not only for their share of mediation expenses but also for their own attorney’s fees, which can be substantial. This encourages parties to consider the financial impact of mediation and legal representation before entering into dispute resolution, potentially influencing their approach and willingness to mediate. [Data: Entities (1472, 1830)]\"},{\"summary\":\"Potential for reduced conflict over cost allocation\",\"explanation\":\"By establishing a clear framework for cost sharing, these provisions help minimize potential conflicts over financial responsibilities during mediation. When parties understand in advance what costs they will share and which they must bear alone, there is less room for disagreement or surprise, contributing to a smoother and more effective mediation process.
