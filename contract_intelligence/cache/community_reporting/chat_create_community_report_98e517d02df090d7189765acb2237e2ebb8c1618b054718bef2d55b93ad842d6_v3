The structure is defined by a Statement of Work and a series of legal clauses, obligations, rights, and risks that govern the provision of professional, technical, and managed services. Key entities include Pinnacle Services, Contoso Enterprises, and a set of contractual provisions such as service levels, change orders, force majeure, and payment rights. The relationships are formalized through obligations to deliver services and deliverables, rights to amend agreements and receive payments, and clauses that address service scope, quality standards, and risk management.
