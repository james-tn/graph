This exclusion is critical as it delineates the circumstances under which tenants are not liable for repairs, shifting the burden to landlords or insurance. The explicit reference to Section 4.7 of the lease further clarifies the legal framework governing such events, reducing ambiguity and potential conflicts between parties.

This provision protects tenants from unforeseen governmental actions and ensures that they are not held responsible for repairs or maintenance in such scenarios. The relationship between the clause and condemnation is clearly defined, providing legal certainty and risk mitigation for tenants.
