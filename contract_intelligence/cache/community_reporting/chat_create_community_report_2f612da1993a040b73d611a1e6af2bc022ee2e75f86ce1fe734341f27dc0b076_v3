Its inclusion in agreements ensures that vendors are legally bound to provide specific consulting, solution design, and architecture services to clients. This clause is referenced in multiple relationships, underscoring its importance in structuring vendor-client interactions and setting clear expectations for service delivery. The clause's presence can mitigate risks related to service ambiguity and enforce accountability for technical deliverables [Data: Entities (1265); Relationships (1959, 1991)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Vendor's Legal Obligation to Provide Consulting Services\",\"explanation\":\"The Obligation to Provide Technology Consulting entity explicitly details the vendor's responsibilities, as imposed by the Technology Consulting Clause.
