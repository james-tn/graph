This clause is a central element in the community, directly imposing a financial obligation on Contoso and setting expectations for timely payment. The relationship between this clause and the obligation to pay is explicit, ensuring that Contoso's payment practices are governed by clear contractual terms.

This amount must be paid promptly and by the due date, as specified in the agreement, such as under Net 60 or Net 30 terms. By distinguishing between disputed and undisputed amounts, the community ensures that only uncontested charges are settled within the designated timeframe, reducing the risk of payment delays and legal disputes.
