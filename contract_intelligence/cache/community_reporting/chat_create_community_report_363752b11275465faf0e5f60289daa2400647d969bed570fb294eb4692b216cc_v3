Key entities include the clause itself, prior agreements and understandings, schedules, and change orders, all of which are interconnected through explicit legal relationships. The clause ensures that only the current agreement and its incorporated documents govern the parties' rights and obligations, rendering any previous or contemporaneous arrangements void. Supplementary documents such as schedules and change orders are explicitly included within the scope of the agreement, further reinforcing the clause's comprehensive nature.
