The entities are closely linked, with Clause 15.3 explicitly granting the right to terminate a Statement of Work (SOW) or the entire agreement if a force majeure event continues for more than sixty consecutive days and materially affects performance.

This clause is designed to address situations where unforeseen events, such as natural disasters or other major disruptions, prevent the fulfillment of contractual obligations for an extended period. By specifying a sixty-day threshold and requiring thirty days’ prior written notice, the clause provides a structured process for termination, balancing the interests of both parties. [Data: Entities (6542)]\"},{\"summary\":\"Right to terminate agreement for extended force majeure is explicitly granted.\",\"explanation\":\"The right to terminate the agreement or SOW in the event of an extended force majeure is explicitly stated as a legal entitlement for either party. This right is directly linked to Clause 15.3, which formalizes the conditions under which termination can occur. The clarity of this provision helps reduce ambiguity and potential disputes, ensuring that both parties understand their options in the face of prolonged disruptions. [Data: Entities (6553); Relationships (12856)]\"},{\"summary\":\"Direct relationship between Clause 15.3 and termination rights.\",\"explanation\":\"There is a direct and explicit relationship between Clause 15.3 and the right to terminate the agreement for extended force majeure. The relationship data confirms that Clause 15.3 is the source of the termination right, making it a central element in the community’s legal structure. This linkage underscores the importance of well-defined contractual clauses in managing risk and providing remedies for parties affected by force majeure events. [Data: Relationships (12856)]\"},{\"summary\":\"Material impact on performance is a key trigger for termination.\",\"explanation\":\"The ability to terminate the agreement is contingent not only on the duration of the force majeure event but also on its material impact on performance. This requirement ensures that termination is reserved for situations where the event significantly impairs the ability of either party to fulfill their contractual obligations, rather than for minor or temporary disruptions. This focus on materiality helps maintain contractual stability while allowing for necessary flexibility in extreme circumstances. [Data: Entities (6542)]\"},{\"summary\":\"Structured notice period protects both parties.\",\"explanation\":\"Clause 15.3 requires thirty days’ prior written notice before termination can take effect. This notice period provides both parties with time to prepare for the consequences of termination, seek alternative solutions, or negotiate adjustments to the agreement. The structured approach to notice helps prevent abrupt or unilateral actions, promoting fairness and transparency in the contractual relationship.
