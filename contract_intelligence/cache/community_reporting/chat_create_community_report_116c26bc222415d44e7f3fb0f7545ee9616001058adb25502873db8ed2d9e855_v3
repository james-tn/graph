This right provides significant legal protection for Contoso, ensuring that it is not financially penalized for software failures or legal disputes. The explicit mention of this right in the contract strengthens Contoso's negotiating position and risk management capabilities [Data: Entities (6259)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Monetary Value of the Refund Right\",\"explanation\":\"The monetary value associated with Contoso's right is the prorated refund of any prepaid, unused fees for affected software.
