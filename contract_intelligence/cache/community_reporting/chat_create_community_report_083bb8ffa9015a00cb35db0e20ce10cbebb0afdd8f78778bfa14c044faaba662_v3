It specifies key terms such as financial charges, subscription periods for cloud services, and the ability to partially terminate individual SOWs without ending the entire agreement. This structure provides flexibility and risk mitigation for both parties, allowing for tailored project management and dispute resolution. The Agreement's clauses ensure that overarching terms take precedence over SOW-specific provisions unless explicitly superseded, maintaining legal clarity and consistency across engagements [Data: Entities (3837, 4113, 4794, 6628); Relationships (7093, 7506, 9031, 12922)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Detailed Scope and Governance in Statements of Work\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Each Statement of Work (SOW) is a mutually executed document that defines the specific scope, deliverables, milestones, timelines, and payment terms for individual projects.
