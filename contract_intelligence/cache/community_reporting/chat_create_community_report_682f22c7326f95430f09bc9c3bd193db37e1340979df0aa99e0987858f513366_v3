The key entities include the 'Obligation to Provide Transition Assistance,' 'Monetary Value: Thirty Days,' and 'Monetary Value: Thirty (30) Days,' all of which are interconnected through legal clauses that define the scope, duration, and financial terms of post-termination support.

This dual timeframe is critical for both parties, as it provides a window for remedying breaches and for ensuring a smooth transition after contract termination. The explicit definition of these periods in the contract reduces ambiguity and helps manage expectations regarding service continuity and legal compliance.
