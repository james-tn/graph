This provision is crucial for long-term contracts, as it allows service providers to account for inflation, market changes, and evolving cost structures. For companies, this clause introduces a variable element in cost forecasting and necessitates ongoing review of contract terms to ensure continued alignment with budgetary constraints. The requirement for notice provides a measure of predictability and an opportunity for renegotiation, balancing the interests of both parties.

This approach incentivizes timely delivery and quality performance, aligning financial rewards with project progress. It also provides companies with greater control over cash flow and risk, as payments are contingent on verifiable deliverables. For service providers, milestone-based fees can enhance reputation and client trust by demonstrating commitment to results. The explicit inclusion of this structure in the contract supports robust project management practices.

Additionally, any fixed-fee components are clearly identified in the SOW, with associated milestones and assumptions. These provisions enhance transparency in billing and facilitate accurate cost estimation for both parties. By clearly delineating the basis for charges, the contract minimizes the risk of misunderstandings and disputes over payment.
