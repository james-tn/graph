This obligation forms the foundation of the community's structure and directly affects Contoso's legal compliance and operational readiness. Failure to fulfill this obligation could result in legal liabilities, operational disruptions, or breaches of contract, making it a central concern for decision-makers.

This definition clarifies the boundaries of Contoso's responsibilities and helps prevent ambiguity in contractual interpretation. Understanding this scope is essential for risk assessment and resource allocation, as it determines which assets and permissions must be proactively managed by Contoso.

If Contoso fails to obtain the necessary licenses or permissions, it may face regulatory penalties, litigation, or loss of operational rights. This risk is heightened in industries with strict licensing requirements or where hardware dependencies are critical to service delivery.

Any lapse in hardware maintenance or license renewal could disrupt business processes, impact service delivery, or result in downtime. This operational risk necessitates robust asset management and compliance tracking systems within Contoso.

Ambiguities in what is 'expressly provided' by Vanguard versus what Contoso must obtain could lead to disagreements, especially if operational failures occur due to unmet obligations. Clear documentation and communication are essential to mitigate this risk.
