This classification has substantial implications for risk management, contract drafting, and dispute resolution, as organizations must account for the possibility of such events disrupting supply chains, international trade, and service delivery.

This connection clarifies that such trade barriers are not merely economic tools but are also regulatory actions with legal consequences, especially in the context of Force Majeure clauses. Organizations operating in international markets must remain vigilant to regulatory changes, as these acts can trigger contractual protections or liabilities, affecting cross-border transactions and long-term strategic planning.

The recognition of these risks as Force Majeure Events provides a legal framework for excusing non-performance, but also requires organizations to maintain robust compliance programs and contingency plans to mitigate exposure. Failure to comply with such regulations can result in penalties, reputational damage, and loss of market access.
