It specifies acceptable delivery methods, including confirmed email (if expressly allowed), overnight courier, and certified mail, and details the designated addresses for each party. This ensures that all parties have clear instructions regarding the acceptable methods and addresses for official communications, thereby supporting legal compliance and reducing ambiguity in contractual obligations [Data: Entities (1504, 1517, 1534, 3334, 3335, 3336, 3345, 1848); Relationships (2470, 6091, 6092, 6093, 6094, 6117, 3069, +more)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Specification of Permitted Delivery Methods and Address Designation\",\"explanation\":\"The Notice Clause explicitly outlines the permitted methods for delivering notices, including personal delivery, confirmed email (with additional requirements), overnight courier, and certified/registered mail. It also imposes an obligation for each party to designate and update its address for receipt of notices, ensuring that communications are sent to the correct location and reducing the risk of misdelivery. These specifications are critical for maintaining the integrity of contractual communications and ensuring that all parties are properly informed of important developments [Data: Entities (1504, 3334, 3335, 3336, 3345, 4531, 4532, 6978, 6984); Relationships (6091, 6092, 6093, 6094, 8472, 8473, 13773, 13774, +more)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Jurisdictional Relevance and Legal Affairs Responsibilities\",\"explanation\":\"The Notice Clause specifies the legal jurisdictions relevant to the parties, including Seattle, Washington for Contoso Enterprises and Bellevue, Washington for Atlas Ventures LLC.

By specifying acceptable delivery methods, deemed receipt times, and the obligation to designate and update notice addresses, the clause reduces the likelihood that a notice will be lost, delayed, or sent to the wrong address. This risk management is essential for ensuring that contractual rights and obligations are triggered in a timely and reliable manner [Data: Entities (3346, 4070, 6971, 6986); Relationships (6119, 7425, 13772, 13775)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Exclusion of Third-Party Rights and Remedies\",\"explanation\":\"Section 16.9 of the Agreement, which is part of the Notice Clause, establishes that the agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties involved and their successors and permitted assigns.

These protocols ensure that all parties understand the procedures for official communications, reducing the risk of disputes and misunderstandings [Data: Entities (1504, 3334, 6984, 1848); Relationships (6092, 13774)].\"},{\"summary\":\"Prepaid Postage Requirement for Certain Delivery Methods\",\"explanation\":\"The Notice Clause requires that postage be prepaid for certain delivery methods, such as overnight courier and certified mail.
