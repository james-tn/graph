This term is commonly applied to entities such as Contoso, Tenant, and Client, and may specify payment within sixty days either from the date of the invoice or from the date of receipt of a valid and undisputed invoice. The intent of \"NET 60\" is to ensure that the payer—whether Contoso, Tenant, or Client—settles all undisputed amounts owed to the vendor or landlord within sixty days of receiving a correct invoice or from the invoice date, as stipulated in relevant agreements or clauses (such as Clause 3.4). This payment term is widely used in business contracts to establish clear expectations for timely payment of invoices.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 403, "total_tokens": 562, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
