This clause establishes that interest will accrue on such overdue payments, specifying the applicable interest rate. It also outlines the requirement for written notice and a cure period before interest is assessed or further actions are taken. Additionally, the clause grants the Service Provider (which may be referred to as Atlas, Vendor, Acme, or Gamma, depending on the context) the right to suspend services if payments remain delinquent after the notice and cure period. The clause is referenced in various sections (such as Clause 3.3, 3.4, 3.6, and Section 3.7) and consistently details the process for interest accrual, notice requirements, cure periods, and the conditions under which the Service Provider may suspend services for overdue undisputed amounts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 191, "prompt_tokens": 387, "total_tokens": 578, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
