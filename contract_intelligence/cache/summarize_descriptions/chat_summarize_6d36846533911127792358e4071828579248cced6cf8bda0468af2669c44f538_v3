Milestones are used to track project progress, trigger review, acceptance, and payment obligations, and may include events such as completion of onboarding, user acceptance testing (UAT), go-live, report delivery, or other key deliverables and deadlines. Upon achievement and confirmation by the Client, milestones typically trigger the Vendor’s right to invoice the Client, as specified in the SOW and Agreement. Milestones are set forth in the project plan and fee schedule, and may be adjusted through approved Change Requests or Change Orders. They serve as agreed benchmarks or deadlines that the Service Provider must meet, and their completion may be itemized on invoices and used to measure progress, trigger payments, and fulfill acceptance procedures.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 181, "prompt_tokens": 635, "total_tokens": 816, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
