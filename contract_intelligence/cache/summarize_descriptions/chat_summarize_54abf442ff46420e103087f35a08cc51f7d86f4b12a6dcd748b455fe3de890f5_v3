The clause is designed to provide flexibility and manage risk for the parties involved.\n\nTypically, the clause permits either party to terminate the agreement or any SOW/PO for convenience, with advance written notice required. The notice periods vary depending on the parties and the specific contract, ranging from as short as thirty (30) days to as long as one hundred eighty (180) days. In some instances, the clause specifies different notice periods for each party; for example, Contoso may terminate with thirty (30) days’ notice while its counterpart (such as Acme, Atlas, Gamma, or Nova) may require sixty (60) days’ notice. In other cases, the clause allows either party to terminate with the same notice period, such as forty-five (45), sixty (60), ninety (90), or one hundred eighty (180) days.\n\nCertain versions of the clause include additional conditions, such as the completion of ongoing SOWs/POs unless otherwise agreed, payment of early termination fees (as in the case of a lease after the first anniversary), or obligations for the terminating party to mitigate damages or complete critical services during the notice period. The clause may also reference specific sections (e.g., Clause 4.2, Clause 4.3) that detail the termination rights and associated obligations, including payment or refund requirements.\n\nOverall, the \"TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE CLAUSE\" provides both parties—such as Contoso, Acme, Atlas, Nova, Gamma, the Company, the Service Provider, the Client, the Vendor, or the Tenant—the right to end the contractual relationship for any reason, subject to the agreed-upon notice periods and any specified conditions or obligations. This clause reflects a desire for contractual flexibility and risk management, with the exact terms tailored to the needs and negotiations of the parties involved.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 439, "prompt_tokens": 1009, "total_tokens": 1448, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
