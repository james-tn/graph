Across various descriptions, the MONETARY CAP is defined as a multiple of the total fees paid or payable by the client to the vendor in the twelve months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. Specifically, the cap has been described as: (1) the total fees paid or payable by Contoso to Summit Tech in the 12 months preceding the claim event; (2) two times the total fees paid or payable by Contoso to Acme under the agreement during the twelve months preceding the event giving rise to the claim; and (3) five times the total fees paid or payable by Client to Vendor in the twelve months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. Resolving these variations, the MONETARY CAP is best summarized as a contractual provision that sets the maximum liability amount at a specified multiple—commonly ranging from one to five times—of the total fees paid or payable by the client to the vendor in the twelve months prior to the claim event, depending on the specific agreement between the parties.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 229, "prompt_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 461, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
