This right is generally subject to advance written notice requirements, which may vary depending on the specific parties and agreements involved. Common notice periods specified include thirty (30) days, forty-five (45) days, sixty (60) days, and up to one hundred eighty (180) days prior written notice. In some cases, such as with Tenant, the right to terminate for convenience may only be exercised after a certain period (e.g., after the first anniversary of the Lease) and may require payment of an early termination fee. Overall, this provision ensures that either party can end the contractual relationship for any reason, provided they adhere to the agreed-upon notice period and any additional conditions outlined in the agreement.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 209, "prompt_tokens": 554, "total_tokens": 763, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
