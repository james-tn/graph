It generally requires one party to obtain the explicit written approval of the other party before proceeding with certain activities. Specifically, prior written consent is required for the assignment or transfer of the agreement or any rights and obligations under it, except in specified cases such as assignments to an Affiliate or Successor in Interest. For example, the Client must obtain the Vendor’s prior written consent before assigning or transferring the agreement, and this consent may be withheld at the Vendor’s sole discretion.\n\nAdditionally, prior written consent is necessary before engaging subprocessors or subcontractors to process Personal Data or Client Data. Entities such as Summit Tech, Vanguard, Acme, and Vendor must obtain Contoso’s or the Client’s written approval before engaging any subprocessor or subcontractor for these purposes.\n\nThe condition also extends to publicity and marketing, requiring the Service Provider to obtain the Company’s written approval before using its name, logos, or trademarks in any publicity or marketing materials. In the context of indemnification, the indemnifying party must secure the indemnified party’s prior written consent before settling any claim that imposes liability or obligation on the indemnified party.\n\nFurthermore, prior written consent is required before any set-off, withholding, or deduction of amounts owed, unless such action is ordered by a court or arbitrator, or as required by law or for bona fide disputed amounts. For instance, Contoso must obtain Acme’s written consent before withholding or deducting payments, except in these specified circumstances.\n\nIn summary, \"PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT\" serves as a safeguard in agreements, ensuring that significant actions such as assignment, amendment, engagement of subprocessors or subcontractors, publicity, settlement of claims, and financial adjustments cannot be undertaken unilaterally and require the express written approval of the relevant party, subject to certain exceptions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 387, "prompt_tokens": 517, "total_tokens": 904, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
