Typically, the Survival Clause ensures that key provisions such as confidentiality, intellectual property rights, indemnification, limitation of liability, insurance, data protection, dispute resolution, general provisions, payment obligations, warranties, remedies, and ongoing Change Orders survive beyond the end of the contract.\n\nConfidentiality obligations commonly survive for a period of five years following expiration or termination, with extended protection for trade secrets and Personal Data for as long as they retain their legal status. Payment obligations, accrued liabilities, and other enduring terms also continue to be enforceable. Specific sections and articles, such as those referenced in Clauses 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 5.6, 5.7, 16.8, 16.10, 16.12, and 16.13, detail which provisions survive, including those related to confidentiality, intellectual property, indemnification, limitation of liability, insurance, data protection, dispute resolution, force majeure, and general provisions.\n\nThe Survival Clause may also state that any provisions which, by their nature, should survive expiration or termination will continue to be effective. This ensures that essential protections and obligations, particularly those concerning confidentiality, payment, and liability, remain enforceable even after the formal end of the agreement or lease.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 302, "prompt_tokens": 1338, "total_tokens": 1640, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
