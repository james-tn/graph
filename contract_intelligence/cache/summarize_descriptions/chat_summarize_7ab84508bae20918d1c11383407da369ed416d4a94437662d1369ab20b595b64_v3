These standards include uptime commitments, response and resolution times, restoration targets, and other quantitative and qualitative metrics that ensure the required level of service performance. The SERVICE LEVELS are set forth primarily in Article XII of the Agreement and may also be detailed in any applicable Statement of Work (SOW), Service Level Schedule, or related schedules.\n\nSERVICE LEVELS apply to various types of services, including hosting, monitoring, managed analytics, and incident management, and are enforceable even after acceptance of deliverables. The Vendor (or named entities such as Acme, Atlas Ventures LLC, or Nova) is obligated to meet these standards when providing services and deliverables to the Client (such as Contoso Enterprises, Inc.), with persistent or repeated failure to do so potentially constituting a material breach of the Agreement. Remedies and cure rights for breaches of SERVICE LEVELS are specified in Article XII.\n\nSERVICE LEVELS may be adjusted through Change Management, upon renewal or extension of the Agreement’s term, or in response to a Force Majeure Event. They also reference the Vendor’s obligation to correct errors or provide workarounds in the event of a software warranty breach. Overall, SERVICE LEVELS define the expected quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of the services, and set the criteria by which the Vendor’s performance is measured and enforced under the Agreement and any applicable SOW.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 321, "prompt_tokens": 1584, "total_tokens": 1905, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
