This right applies to various entities, such as Contoso, which is entitled to receive service credits if vendors like Atlas, Vanguard, Acme, or Nova fail to meet specified service levels or availability thresholds. The service credits are typically calculated as a percentage of monthly fees, based on the level of service availability achieved, and are applicable against future fees.
