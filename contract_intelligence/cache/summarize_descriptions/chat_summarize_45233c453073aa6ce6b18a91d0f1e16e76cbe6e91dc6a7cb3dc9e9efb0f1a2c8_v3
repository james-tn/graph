Specifically, it requires that assignment or transfer of the Statement of Work (SOW) generally needs the other Party's prior written consent, except in cases of assignment to an Affiliate or successor in interest. Additionally, any settlements that would impose liability or obligations on the Indemnified Party require that party's prior written consent. The condition also applies to actions such as assignment, amendment, or publicity, which must be approved in writing by the other Party as specified in various contract clauses. Furthermore, the Service Provider must obtain the Company's prior written consent before incorporating certain open-source software into the Deliverables. Overall, \"CONDITION OF WRITTEN CONSENT\" ensures that key contractual changes or actions are subject to approval, protecting the interests of all parties involved.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 183, "prompt_tokens": 240, "total_tokens": 423, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
