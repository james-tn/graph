Subcontractors are not employees of the engaging entity and may be engaged to process Personal Data or perform material portions of the Services. Their engagement is subject to specific obligations, including confidentiality, data protection, and security requirements, and they must be bound by written agreements that are consistent with the primary provider’s obligations under the contract. In certain cases, such as when engaged by Vanguard or Acme, prior written consent from another party (e.g., Contoso) may be required, and the subcontractor must comply with all protective agreements and contract terms.
