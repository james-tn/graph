This term is used as a unit of time measurement for calculating various deadlines, response times, and review periods related to contractual obligations. \"BUSINESS DAYS\" is applied to set timeframes for actions such as providing certificates of insurance (e.g., ten business days after the Effective Date), delivering written notices for suspension of services (e.g., ten business days’ prior notice), disputing invoices (e.g., fifteen business days for Client to dispute invoices), and curing late payments (e.g., ten business days for cure periods).\n\nAdditionally, \"BUSINESS DAYS\" is used to measure periods for reviewing and providing feedback on deliverables (e.g., not to exceed ten business days unless otherwise agreed), negotiating and escalating disputes, and evaluating change requests. It also defines the timeframes for notification and advance communication of scheduled maintenance, as well as the duration and response times for service disruptions and incident management under the Lease.
