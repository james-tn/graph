These credits are typically calculated as a percentage of monthly fees, including SaaS Fees, and are applied against future invoices rather than being redeemable for cash or refunds. SERVICE CREDITS constitute the sole and exclusive monetary remedy available to the affected party for such service level failures, and may require a written request to be awarded. In some cases, credits are mutually agreed upon and allocated monthly for ongoing managed services, serving both as a measure and compensation for service delivery.
