This obligation requires the Receiving Party to use at least a reasonable degree of care—no less than the care it uses to protect its own similar information—to prevent unauthorized use, access, or disclosure of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party must use the Confidential Information solely for the purposes of the Agreement or contract, and not disclose it to third parties except as expressly permitted by the Agreement. The Receiving Party is also required to limit access to the Confidential Information, ensuring that only authorized employees, contractors, or advisors who are bound to comply with confidentiality obligations have access. These requirements are typically detailed in specific sections or articles of the Agreement, such as Section 5.2, Section 5.3, or Article V, and are set forth in the Confidentiality Clause. Overall, the obligation encompasses using, protecting, and restricting disclosure of Confidential Information, and applies equally to both parties in the context of mutual confidentiality agreements.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 215, "prompt_tokens": 693, "total_tokens": 908, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
