This clause allows the disputing party—typically the Client or Contoso—to withhold payment of the disputed portion of an invoice, provided that specific conditions are met. These conditions generally include providing written notification of the dispute, often required within fifteen (15) days of receiving the invoice, and cooperating in good faith to resolve the dispute.\n\nThe clause also stipulates that the undisputed portions of the invoice must be paid promptly, ensuring that only the contested amounts are withheld. In some versions, such as Clause 3.7, there are additional restrictions placed on the Vendor, preventing them from suspending services due to amounts that are under dispute. The clause emphasizes the importance of cooperation between the parties to resolve disputes efficiently and maintains obligations for continued service during the dispute resolution process.\n\nOverall, the \"DISPUTED AMOUNTS CLAUSE\" provides a clear framework for notification, payment of undisputed amounts, and collaborative resolution of invoice disputes, protecting the interests of both the paying and receiving parties, such as Contoso and Vanguard.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 246, "prompt_tokens": 578, "total_tokens": 824, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
