The clause details the client's entitlement to service credits, which are calculated based on the percentage of uptime achieved and are specified in the Statement of Work (SOW). In some cases, such as Clause 12.3, the clause sets out that service credits are the sole and exclusive remedy for SLA breaches, while also specifying conditions under which a material breach may be deemed to occur. Clause 12.4 further provides for the possibility of additional remedies beyond service credits if the vendor fails to meet guaranteed service levels. Overall, the \"REMEDIES FOR SLA BREACHES CLAUSE\" ensures that clients are compensated through service credits or other specified remedies when service providers do not fulfill their contractual service level obligations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 316, "total_tokens": 519, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
