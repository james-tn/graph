Typically, termination under this clause requires written notice and provides a cure period—often thirty (30) days—during which the breaching party may remedy the breach. If the breach is not cured within the specified period, or if insolvency or similar events occur, termination may be immediate. The clause may also outline specific events of default and remedies, such as recovery of possession in lease agreements. Clauses referenced as 4.3, 4.3.1, and 4.4 consistently permit either party to terminate the Agreement or SOWs for material breach or insolvency, with detailed conditions, notice requirements, and cure periods. Overall, the \"TERMINATION FOR CAUSE CLAUSE\" provides a mechanism for parties to exit the contract in response to serious breaches or financial instability, ensuring protection and recourse in such circumstances.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 249, "prompt_tokens": 873, "total_tokens": 1122, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
