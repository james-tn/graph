It requires explicit written consent—often via email—from the relevant party before proceeding with certain activities. Specifically, \"WRITTEN APPROVAL\" is necessary for Vanguard to incur any single expense exceeding $1,500, and for a Client to authorize actions such as exceeding monthly estimates or incurring specific expenses. Additionally, the Company must obtain written approval for timeline extensions, fee adjustments, or other changes to the Agreement or Statement of Work (SOW). In the context of Summit Tech, written approval from Contoso is required before using open-source or third-party software in deliverables.
