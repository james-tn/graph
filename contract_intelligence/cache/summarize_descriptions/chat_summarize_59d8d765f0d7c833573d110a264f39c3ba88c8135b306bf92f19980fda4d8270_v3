It is generally required for the assignment or transfer of the Agreement, except in cases involving Affiliates, Successors in Interest, or other specified circumstances as detailed in the Assignment Clause. Specifically, written consent is necessary for the Company to assign, transfer, or dispose of the Agreement, as outlined in the Assignment Clause.\n\nAdditionally, \"WRITTEN CONSENT\" is required in several other contexts:\n- Contoso’s written consent is needed for Acme to exceed five percent (5%) per annum in certain fees.\n- Summit Tech must obtain Contoso’s prior written consent before engaging subcontractors for material portions of the services.\n- The Indemnified Party’s prior written consent is required before the Indemnifying Party may settle any claim that imposes admission of fault or non-monetary obligations.\n- The Service Provider’s prior written consent is necessary for the Company to withhold, offset, or deduct amounts from Fees, except as required by law or permitted by the Agreement.\n- Vendor may not notify third parties about a Data Breach without Client’s prior written consent, unless required by Applicable Law.\n\nOverall, \"WRITTEN CONSENT\" serves as a protective contractual mechanism, ensuring that certain actions—such as assignment, fee changes, subcontracting, claim settlements, fee deductions, and data breach notifications—cannot be taken without the explicit, prior approval of the relevant party, except in circumstances expressly permitted by the Agreement or required by law.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 311, "prompt_tokens": 360, "total_tokens": 671, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
