Article XIV details a multi-step process that typically begins with good faith negotiation and may include escalation to senior executives within defined timeframes. If disputes are not resolved through negotiation, the Article provides for mediation as the next step. Should mediation fail, the procedures allow for further resolution through arbitration and/or litigation, including provisions for venue, jurisdiction, and injunctive relief. Overall, Article XIV ensures that disputes are addressed through a structured process involving informal negotiation, escalation, mediation, and, if necessary, formal legal proceedings.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 355, "total_tokens": 513, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
