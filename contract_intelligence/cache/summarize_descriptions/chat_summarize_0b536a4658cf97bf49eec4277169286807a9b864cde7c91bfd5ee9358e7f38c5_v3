This condition is specifically referenced as a trigger for various contractual remedies, including indemnification obligations and termination rights. If a material breach occurs and is not cured within the specified period—typically thirty (30) days following written notice—the non-breaching party may terminate the Agreement or SOW for cause. Material breach may also arise from persistent or severe service level failures, failure of deliverables to meet acceptance criteria after two resubmissions, or significant violations of contract terms or applicable law by either party.\n\nIn the context of the Agreement, a material breach can result in remedies beyond service credits, affect cost allocation for transition assistance, and may lead to the revocation of licenses to use Vendor Pre-Existing Materials, Work Product, or Deliverables, particularly if the breach is by the Client or Company and remains uncured. Both Vendor and Client are subject to indemnification obligations if they materially breach the Agreement or violate applicable law. Overall, \"MATERIAL BREACH\" is a critical contractual condition that, if not remedied within the cure period, entitles the non-breaching party—such as Contoso—to pursue termination for cause and other specified remedies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 261, "prompt_tokens": 963, "total_tokens": 1224, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
