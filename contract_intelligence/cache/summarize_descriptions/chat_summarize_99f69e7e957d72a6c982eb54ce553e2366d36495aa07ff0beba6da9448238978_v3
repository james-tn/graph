This clause generally limits each party’s liability for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, as well as for loss of profits, revenue, business, goodwill, or anticipated savings, except for specified exceptions. It sets monetary caps on aggregate liability, which may be defined as a multiple (such as three or five times) of the amounts paid or payable by one party to the other in the twelve months preceding the claim event. In some cases, the cap is set to the total fees paid or payable, while in high-risk engagements, the clause may specify that there is no contractual cap on liability.\n\nThe clause also includes exclusions for certain claims, such as indemnification obligations, gross negligence, willful misconduct, intellectual property infringement, and obligations to pay rent or restore damage in the context of a lease. It allocates risk between the parties and may define carve-outs or exceptions to the general limitations, ensuring that some liabilities remain uncapped or are subject to different rules.\n\nSections within Article IX, such as 9.1 to 9.4, further detail the exclusions, caps, exceptions, and aggregation of claims, and may specify that the limitation of liability clause survives termination or expiration of the agreement. Overall, the \"LIMITATION OF LIABILITY CLAUSE\" in Article IX serves to balance and allocate risk between the parties by clearly defining the types and amounts of damages recoverable, setting caps on liability, and outlining exceptions where liability may be uncapped or subject to different terms.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 349, "prompt_tokens": 1170, "total_tokens": 1519, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
