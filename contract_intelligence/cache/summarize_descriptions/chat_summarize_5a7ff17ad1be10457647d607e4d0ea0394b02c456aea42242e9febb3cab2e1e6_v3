Typically, this clause specifies that in the event of a conflict between the main agreement and any Statement of Work (SOW), the main agreement prevails unless the SOW expressly modifies or supersedes a specific provision, and such modification is clearly stated and signed by both parties. The clause may also outline a broader hierarchy among documents, generally prioritizing the main body of the agreement, followed by the SOW, then Change Orders, Purchase Orders (PO), and other incorporated or referenced documents, unless otherwise specified. In some cases, specific sub-clauses (such as Clause 16.13) may state that a SOW or Change Order can prevail over the agreement, and a Change Order can prevail over a SOW, if expressly stated. Additionally, when personal data processing is involved, the clause may establish that the Data Processing Agreement takes precedence over the Master Agreement in case of conflict regarding personal data processing. Overall, the \"ORDER OF PRECEDENCE CLAUSE\" provides a clear framework for determining which document governs in the event of conflicting terms, ensuring contractual clarity and minimizing disputes.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 252, "prompt_tokens": 450, "total_tokens": 702, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
