This risk encompasses non-compliance with data protection and privacy laws, such as GDPR and CCPA, as well as export control regulations, confidentiality requirements, and travel and expense policies. Non-compliance may affect the performance of services or deliverables, potentially resulting in legal or contractual consequences, rejection of deliverables, or the need for remediation.\n\nThe risk is mitigated through various mechanisms, including representations and warranties, compliance obligations, audit rights, and contractual safeguards. Specific clauses, such as Clause 7.3, address the risk of the Client’s use of deliverables or services violating applicable law or processing regulated data without proper agreement. Vendor obligations, including background checks and adherence to written policies and specifications, further help ensure compliance. Both parties are responsible for ensuring that their actions under the Agreement comply with all relevant laws and contractual requirements, with failure to do so potentially impacting service delivery and contract performance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 237, "prompt_tokens": 555, "total_tokens": 792, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
