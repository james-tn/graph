These obligations apply to entities such as Contoso Enterprises, the Company, the Client, the Tenant, and other Parties, and include payments to service providers like Vanguard Solutions, Inc., Nova, and Vendors, as referenced in Article III and the Survival Clause of the Agreement.\n\nPayment Obligations are specifically excluded from liability limitations as per Section 9.3, meaning parties remain responsible for these payments regardless of any caps or limits on liability elsewhere in the Agreement. These obligations survive the expiration or termination of the Agreement, ensuring that financial commitments accrued prior to termination must still be fulfilled.\n\nFurthermore, Payment Obligations are not excused, suspended, or delayed during disputes or Force Majeure Events, except in cases where payment systems are directly impacted. This means that, even in the event of extended Force Majeure or ongoing disputes, each Party is required to pay undisputed amounts for all services performed and deliverables provided up to the effective date of termination. In summary, \"PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS\" ensure that all parties remain accountable for their financial commitments under the Agreement, regardless of termination, dispute, or most Force Majeure circumstances.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 275, "prompt_tokens": 471, "total_tokens": 746, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
