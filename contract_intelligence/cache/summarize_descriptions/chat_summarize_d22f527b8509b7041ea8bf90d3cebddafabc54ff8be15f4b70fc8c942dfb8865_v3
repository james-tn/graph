This clause applies to changes in scope, deliverables, timelines, schedules, milestones, specifications, service levels, fees, and other terms under the Agreement or any Statement of Work (SOW). It outlines procedures for both Party-initiated changes, including those requested by the Landlord or Tenant in the context of a Lease, and ensures that all changes—whether to the Building, Services, Premises, Common Areas, or project plan—are properly requested, documented, assessed, and approved.\n\nThe clause requires that changes be proposed via written Change Requests or Change Orders, which must be evaluated and formally approved by both Parties before implementation. Material changes to schedules, milestones, or contract value are subject to this process, and all modifications must be documented in a Change Order executed by both Parties. Article XIII comprises multiple sub-clauses (such as 13.1–13.4) detailing the specific steps and rights involved in the change management process, ensuring transparency, accountability, and mutual agreement for any adjustments to the contractual terms.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 257, "prompt_tokens": 673, "total_tokens": 930, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
