Contoso has the right to terminate the relevant portion of the SOW if Vanguard is unable to correct material nonconformities after a reasonable number of attempts, as well as in the event of breach of warranty and non-conformity. Either party may terminate an individual SOW for convenience or cause, and such termination does not automatically terminate the main Agreement. The Service Provider has the right to terminate the applicable SOW if infringement claims cannot be reasonably resolved. Additionally, either party may terminate the affected SOW if a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, provided written notice is given.
