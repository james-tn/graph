This clause typically allows the recipient (Acme, Vanguard, Vendor, Nova, or the Service Provider) to freely use, disclose, reproduce, license, and otherwise exploit any feedback received, without restriction, obligation, or payment. In several instances, the clause also requires that the provider of feedback (such as Contoso, Client, or the Company) will not be identified as the source of the feedback without their prior written consent. Additionally, some versions of the clause stipulate that all rights in the feedback are assigned to the recipient (e.g., Vanguard or the Service Provider), granting them full ownership and control over its use. Overall, the \"FEEDBACK CLAUSE\" ensures that feedback can be utilized by the recipient for any purpose, while protecting the identity of the provider unless explicit consent is given.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 215, "prompt_tokens": 306, "total_tokens": 521, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
