This clause establishes default payment milestones that are tied to specific project phases and deliverables, with designated percentages of the total Contract Value or fees allocated to each milestone. Typical milestones include payments due upon contract execution, completion of key project milestones, delivery of work, acceptance of deliverables, and final project completion. The clause requires that each Statement of Work (SOW) specify the relevant payment milestones, which may include deposits, milestone-based payments, and periodic invoicing. It also provides representative examples of how fees may be distributed across various stages of project delivery and acceptance, ensuring clarity in the payment schedule and expectations for both parties.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 282, "total_tokens": 441, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
