It encompasses any governmental or taxing authority imposing taxes, as referenced in the definition of Taxes, and includes jurisdictions where Contoso uses Deliverables or Products, which are pertinent for determining infringement of Intellectual Property Rights.\n\nWithin agreements, \"JURISDICTION\" is referenced in relation to applicable law, particularly concerning interest rates, tax obligations, and tax withholding, as well as in governing law and dispute resolution clauses. Courts of competent jurisdiction are cited for awarding damages, resolving claims, and handling compelled disclosures, including those required by law, regulation, or court order. Specific examples include the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington, and San Francisco County, California, which may have exclusive jurisdiction and venue for disputes arising under certain agreements.\n\n\"JURISDICTION\" also covers legal territories relevant to data protection and insurance requirements, such as the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and the United States, especially in the context of data transfer restrictions and compliance with regulations like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is relevant for determining where services are performed, where insurers must be licensed, and for workers’ compensation requirements.\n\nThe term further includes references to federal, state, county, municipal, local, or foreign governments, and courts or tribunals of competent jurisdiction, as defined in specific clauses (e.g., Clause 1.12). \"JURISDICTION\" is often implied by references to \"Applicable Law,\" which governs interest rates, maximum interest on late payments, tax exemption certificates, insurance and liability clauses, limitation of liability, damages, trade secret status, and other legal matters. While the specific jurisdiction may not always be explicitly named in the agreement, it is typically present or defined elsewhere in the contract.\n\nIn summary, \"JURISDICTION\" in contractual contexts refers to the legal authority and geographic area that governs the agreement’s interpretation, enforcement, compliance, dispute resolution, and regulatory obligations, including but not limited to tax, data protection, insurance, labor, workplace, immigration, and other relevant laws and regulations. It may be explicitly stated (such as specific courts or regions) or implied through references to applicable law and regulatory requirements.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 488, "prompt_tokens": 2532, "total_tokens": 3020, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
