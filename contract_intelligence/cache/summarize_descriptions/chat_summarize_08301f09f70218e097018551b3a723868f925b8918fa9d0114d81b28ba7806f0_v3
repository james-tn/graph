This clause specifies that the party seeking indemnification (the Indemnified Party) must provide prompt notification to the party responsible for indemnifying (the Indemnifying Party) regarding any claims. It details the rights and obligations related to the control of the defense, including allowing the Indemnifying Party to assume and manage the defense of such claims. The procedures also address restrictions on settlement, ensuring that settlements cannot be made without appropriate consent, and emphasize the requirement for cooperation between both parties throughout the process.
