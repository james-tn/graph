This term applies in various contexts, such as:\n\n- A license granted by Vanguard to Contoso for use of Vanguard’s Pre-Existing IP, which does not prevent Vanguard from granting similar rights to others.\n- A license granted to a company and its affiliates to use Service Provider Materials, as specified in Clause 6.2, without exclusivity, allowing the Service Provider to grant similar rights to others.\n- A license arrangement where Vendor is permitted to use Client Materials and Client is permitted to use Vendor Pre-Existing IP and Third-Party Materials, with neither party excluded from granting similar rights to others.\n- The nature of licenses exchanged between Landlord and Tenant for use of certain intellectual property, indicating that neither party has exclusive rights.\n- Licenses granted to Contoso for Vendor Materials and to Summit Tech for Client Materials, both of which are non-exclusive.\n- Licenses granted by Client to Vendor for use of Client Materials, which are non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable except as specifically permitted.\n\nIn summary, a \"NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE\" is a license that allows the licensee to use specified materials or intellectual property, but does not prevent the licensor from granting the same or similar rights to other parties. It may also include additional restrictions such as being non-transferable and non-sublicensable, depending on the specific agreement.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 321, "prompt_tokens": 355, "total_tokens": 676, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
