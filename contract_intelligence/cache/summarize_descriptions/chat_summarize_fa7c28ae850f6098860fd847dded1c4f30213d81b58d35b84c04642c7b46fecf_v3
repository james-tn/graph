Clause 2.2 outlines the foundational requirements for SOWs, mandating that each SOW must reference the overarching Agreement, be sequentially numbered, and include detailed descriptions, specifications, schedules, fees, and conditions for resolving any conflicts between the Agreement and individual SOWs. Clause 2.3 further specifies the required contents of each SOW, including a clear definition of services, deliverables, timelines, fees, personnel, service levels, scope, milestones, dependencies, terms, and acceptance criteria. It also describes the process for entering into SOWs, emphasizing the need for written agreement between the Parties on the nature and scope of services, deliverables, assumptions, and other relevant details. Overall, the \"STATEMENTS OF WORK CLAUSE\" allows the Parties to agree to written SOWs that describe specific projects, deliverables, fees, and schedules, while providing mechanisms for conflict resolution and ensuring comprehensive documentation of all relevant aspects of each SOW.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 227, "prompt_tokens": 324, "total_tokens": 551, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
