Such unauthorized assignments or transfers are expressly prohibited by the agreement and, if attempted, are deemed null and void, thereby invalidating the transaction and potentially the associated contractual rights or obligations. In the context of a lease, this includes the risk that a tenant may assign the lease or sublet the premises without proper consent, which would constitute an Event of Default. The Assignment Clause is designed to mitigate this risk by ensuring that any assignment, transfer, or delegation without proper consent is rendered ineffective and does not impact the enforceability of the agreement.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 179, "prompt_tokens": 446, "total_tokens": 625, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
