In such cases, the clause ensures that the remaining provisions of the agreement continue in full force and effect, provided that essential terms and conditions, including economic terms, are not materially affected. The clause typically stipulates that the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision shall either be severed from the agreement, enforced to the maximum extent permissible, or modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable. Furthermore, the parties are generally required to negotiate in good faith to replace the invalid provision with a valid substitute that closely reflects the original intent of the parties. This approach maintains the integrity and enforceability of the agreement as a whole, even if individual provisions are found to be problematic.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 208, "prompt_tokens": 1235, "total_tokens": 1443, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
