This assistance is typically provided for a period of up to ninety (90) days, although in some cases, such as Clause 4.7, the duration may be up to sixty (60) days. The services are intended to ensure an orderly and smooth transition of services to the client or a successor provider.\n\nTransition assistance is generally provided at the service provider’s then-current time and materials (T&M) rates, at standard rates, or as otherwise agreed in a separate SOW or Change Order. The client is usually responsible for the associated costs unless the termination is due to the service provider’s uncured material breach, in which case the obligation to provide transition services may be limited or the cost allocation may differ. In some instances, transition assistance must be requested in writing prior to termination or expiration.\n\nOverall, the clause is designed to facilitate the transfer of services and minimize disruption, ensuring continuity for the client during the transition period.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 261, "prompt_tokens": 446, "total_tokens": 707, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
