This risk specifically excludes unsuccessful attempts or activities that do not result in actual access, exfiltration, or compromise of data. A data breach compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Personal Data or Confidential Information in the possession or control of the Vendor or Service Provider, and may affect the rights and freedoms of individuals.\n\nA data breach is defined in agreements as an incident requiring notification to affected parties and, where applicable, to regulatory authorities under Applicable Law (as described in Article XI). It triggers obligations for notification, cooperation, mitigation, and remediation, and may also activate additional audit rights for clients such as Contoso under Security Audits Clauses. Data breaches are subject to data protection obligations, and are often covered by the Vendor’s Cyber Liability insurance, though liability caps may apply except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\nIn summary, a \"DATA BREACH\" encompasses any unauthorized access, acquisition, disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction of Personal Data or Client Data processed under an agreement, requiring prompt notification, mitigation, and remediation, and is addressed by contractual security measures, insurance coverage, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 296, "prompt_tokens": 824, "total_tokens": 1120, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
