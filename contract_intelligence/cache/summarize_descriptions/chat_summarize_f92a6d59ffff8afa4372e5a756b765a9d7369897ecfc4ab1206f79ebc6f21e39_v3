Under this clause, the Service Provider is required to retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to perform the contracted services or as required by applicable law. Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, or upon the Client’s or Company’s request, the Service Provider must return or securely delete/anonymize all Personal Data and Client Data, except where retention is mandated by law, legal obligations, or specific policy exceptions.\n\nThe clause further specifies that these obligations apply to all relevant data, including client materials, and may require certification of deletion. Certain sections and sub-clauses (such as Clause 11.5, 11.6, 11.7, 11.8, and 11.9) detail the processes and conditions for retention, deletion, and return, including requirements for secure deletion, anonymization, and handling of backup systems. The clause also addresses ongoing confidentiality and data protection obligations, ensuring that data is handled in compliance with legal and business requirements. In summary, the \"DATA RETENTION AND DELETION CLAUSE\" ensures that Service Providers like Acme, Nova, Atlas, Vendor, Vanguard, Phoenix, and Summit Tech manage Personal Data and Client Data responsibly, retaining it only as necessary and securely deleting or returning it upon contract termination, expiration, or request, subject to applicable laws and exceptions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 327, "prompt_tokens": 1071, "total_tokens": 1398, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
