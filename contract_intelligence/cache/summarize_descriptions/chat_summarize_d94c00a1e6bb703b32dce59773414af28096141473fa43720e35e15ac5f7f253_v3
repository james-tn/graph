Generally, if a Force Majeure Event persists for more than sixty consecutive days and substantially prevents or materially affects the performance of a material obligation or service, either party may terminate the affected SOW(s), the Agreement, or relevant portions thereof without penalty. In some cases, termination rights may be triggered after thirty consecutive days if all SOWs are affected, or after ninety consecutive days if the Force Majeure Event continues to materially affect performance. The specific duration and scope of termination rights may vary, but the core principle is that prolonged Force Majeure Events that significantly impact contractual performance grant either party the right to terminate the Agreement or affected SOWs.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 199, "prompt_tokens": 449, "total_tokens": 648, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
