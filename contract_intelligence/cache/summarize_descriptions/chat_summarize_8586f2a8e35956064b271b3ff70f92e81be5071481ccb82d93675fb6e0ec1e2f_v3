The clause consistently states that all fees for services and deliverables are exclusive of applicable taxes. The primary responsibility for paying taxes associated with the services or deliverables—such as sales, use, value-added, or similar taxes—rests with the Client or Company (e.g., Contoso), except for taxes based on the Service Provider’s or Vendor’s own net income, property, franchise, gross receipts, or employment-related taxes, which remain the responsibility of the Service Provider or Vendor.\n\nThe clause further outlines procedures for tax invoicing, requiring that taxes be separately itemized and documented on invoices. It also addresses the process for providing and handling tax exemption certificates, allowing the Client or Company to claim exemptions where applicable. In cases where withholding taxes are required by law, the clause specifies the procedures for withholding and remitting such taxes, and may include gross-up obligations to ensure the Service Provider receives the agreed net amount after any required deductions.\n\nOverall, the \"TAXES CLAUSE\" ensures clarity regarding which party is responsible for which taxes, mandates proper documentation and invoicing of taxes, and provides mechanisms for tax exemption and compliance with legal requirements, thereby minimizing disputes and facilitating cooperation to mitigate the tax impact on both parties.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 304, "prompt_tokens": 1016, "total_tokens": 1320, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
