These risks include the possibility that termination, expiration, or transition of agreements or Statements of Work (SOW) may disrupt the orderly transfer of services to the Client or a successor provider. Service disruption may also occur if parties such as Contoso fail to perform their responsibilities in a timely manner, or if the Vendor does not meet uptime or response time commitments, which could lead to service termination and potential refunds. Additional risks stem from incidents, scheduled maintenance, system instability, or changes that may materially impact service availability or the Service Provider’s ability to meet agreed timelines. Furthermore, services may be disrupted or become unavailable due to Force Majeure Events, third-party failures, or other specified exclusions. Overall, \"RISK OF SERVICE DISRUPTION\" encompasses all these scenarios that could negatively affect the continuity and reliability of services provided under the agreement.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 200, "prompt_tokens": 334, "total_tokens": 534, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
