This state may also encompass situations such as bankruptcy, receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or cessation of business operations. Under the terms described, if a party becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, makes an assignment for creditors, or ceases business, the other party is granted immediate rights to terminate the Agreement or Statement of Work (SOW) for cause. These termination rights are triggered by insolvency or related proceedings, ensuring that a party may end the contractual relationship if the other party is unable to meet its financial obligations or is subject to bankruptcy or similar events.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 445, "total_tokens": 588, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
