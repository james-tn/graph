According to one description, the clause specifies that liability caps are expressly uncapped and interpreted in favor of the Vendor, meaning there is no upper limit to the Vendor's liability. However, another description states that the clause, found in Section 9.2, caps each Party’s aggregate liability to two times the total fees paid by the Company to the Service Provider in the twelve months preceding the claim event. Reconciling these descriptions, the comprehensive summary is as follows:\n\nThe \"LIABILITY CAP CLAUSE\" is a contractual provision that generally seeks to limit each Party’s aggregate liability to two times the total fees paid by the Company to the Service Provider in the twelve months preceding the claim event, as specified in Section 9.2. However, the clause also contains language indicating that liability caps may be expressly uncapped and interpreted in favor of the Vendor, suggesting that in certain circumstances, the Vendor’s liability may not be subject to the stated cap. This dual approach means that while a liability cap is established for most situations, exceptions may exist where the cap does not apply, particularly benefiting the Vendor.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 244, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 431, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
