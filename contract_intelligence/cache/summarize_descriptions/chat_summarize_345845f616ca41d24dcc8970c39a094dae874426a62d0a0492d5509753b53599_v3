Specifically, the liability cap is calculated as a multiple of the total fees paid or payable by the Company (or Client) to the Service Provider (or Vendor) within the preceding twelve months. There are variations in the multiple used: in some instances, the liability cap is defined as three times the total fees paid or payable by Contoso to Atlas in the preceding twelve months, while in other cases, it is set at two times the total fees paid or payable by the Company to the Service Provider in the same period. Overall, the \"LIABILITY CAP\" clause ties the maximum liability directly to the \"FEES\" paid or payable, with the specific multiple subject to the terms agreed between the parties.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 402, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
