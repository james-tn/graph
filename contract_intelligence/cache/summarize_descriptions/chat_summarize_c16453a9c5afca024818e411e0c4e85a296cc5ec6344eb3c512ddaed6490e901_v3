This obligation includes payment for all undisputed fees, properly documented and non-cancellable expenses, and any approved unreimbursed or wind-down assistance expenses, as specified in the agreement, statements of work, and purchase orders. \n\nPayment obligations are triggered by the completion of milestones as set forth in the project plan and fee schedule, and are a condition for the client’s ownership of deliverables and associated intellectual property rights. The company or client is required to pay all undisputed amounts due under properly issued invoices within thirty (30) days of receipt, and to fulfill all outstanding payment obligations upon termination, including those accrued prior to the effective date of termination.\n\nImportantly, “PAYMENT OBLIGATION” is specifically excluded from relief or suspension under the Force Majeure Clause, meaning that payment commitments must still be fulfilled even if the agreement is terminated due to a Force Majeure Event or extended Force Majeure. These obligations survive termination and are not excused by such events. Payment obligations are also referenced as exceptions to liability caps in the agreement.\n\nIn summary, “PAYMENT OBLIGATION” encompasses the parties’ duty to pay for all services, products, and deliverables provided and accepted up to termination, including all undisputed fees and expenses, and remains enforceable regardless of termination circumstances, including those involving Force Majeure.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 337, "prompt_tokens": 784, "total_tokens": 1121, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
