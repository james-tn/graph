Under the Force Majeure Clause, it requires the affected party to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of a Force Majeure Event and resume performance. For Service Providers, this standard obligates them to use reasonable efforts to minimize disruption to the Company upon termination for convenience, and to correct any reproducible nonconformity in deliverables at no additional charge. Vendors are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure Managed Services are available at least 99.9% of the time and to correct non-conformities in deliverables.
