The specific expiration date varies depending on the context and the particular agreement referenced. Across the provided descriptions, \"EXPIRATION DATE\" has been defined as several different dates, including but not limited to: May 1, 2026; July 10, 2027; August 22, 2027; October 25, 2027; November 18, 2027; January 27, 2028; February 23, 2028; March 27, 2028; April 15, 2028; July 15, 2028; October 24, 2028; November 11, 2028; November 29, 2028; December 22, 2028; January 8, 2029; April 16, 2029; June 14, 2029; June 29, 2029; and July 3, 2029. In some cases, the expiration date marks the end of the initial term, after which renewal or extension may be possible, or holdover provisions may apply (such as in a Lease). The expiration date may also apply to the end of a Statement of Work or project, subject to extensions or change orders.
