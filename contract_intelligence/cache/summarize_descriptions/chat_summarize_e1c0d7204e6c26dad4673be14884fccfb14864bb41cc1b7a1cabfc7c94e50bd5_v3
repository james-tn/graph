It specifies that fees may be structured as fixed fees for defined deliverables or project services, time-and-materials fees for advisory, support, or managed services, milestone-based fees, recurring service or subscription fees, license fees, reimbursable expenses, pass-through costs, and contingency or change order budgets. The clause details that the applicable fee components—such as base subscription, usage-based charges, professional services, implementation, support, and change order fees—are set forth in each Statement of Work (SOW) or as specified in the agreement. For example, in agreements between Contoso and Acme or Vanguard, the clause identifies the types of fees payable, including fixed, time-and-materials, recurring, license, implementation, support, and expenses. Overall, the \"FEE STRUCTURE CLAUSE\" provides a comprehensive framework for the calculation and payment of fees, ensuring clarity regarding the types, components, and basis for charges associated with services and deliverables under the contract.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 224, "prompt_tokens": 493, "total_tokens": 717, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
