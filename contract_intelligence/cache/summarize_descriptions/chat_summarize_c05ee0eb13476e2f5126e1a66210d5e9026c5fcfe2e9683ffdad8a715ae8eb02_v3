Each SOW details the requirements, specifications, and acceptance criteria for Deliverables and Work Product, and may also include instructions for processing personal data, personnel requirements, and obligations related to third-party materials, licensing, and intellectual property ownership.\n\nSOWs are incorporated by reference into the Agreement and may supplement, modify, or supersede certain terms of the main contract, as referenced in clauses such as Priority of Documents and Order of Precedence. They may specify exceptions to ownership, assignment, or licensing terms for Deliverables and Work Product, and can include additional terms regarding support hours, service levels, incident categories, escalation paths, and authorized uses.\n\nSOWs are subject to amendment through Change Orders or other change management processes, and may be terminated or expired independently of the main Agreement under certain conditions, such as extended Force Majeure Events, breach of warranty, unresolved infringement claims, or for convenience or cause as specified in the Agreement. Termination provisions may allow either Party, or specific parties such as the Vendor, Contoso, Phoenix, or the Company, to terminate an SOW under defined circumstances.
