These taxes include, but are not limited to, sales, use, value-added, goods and services, and similar taxes. The obligation specifically excludes taxes that are based on the Vendor’s, Service Provider’s, or other counterparty’s net income, property, or employment (including employee-related taxes). In some cases, if withholding of taxes is required by law, the Client may be required to gross up payments to ensure the Vendor receives the full amount due. Additionally, the obligation to pay taxes does not extend to taxes for which the Client, Contoso, or the Company is exempt. Overall, the entity is responsible for all taxes arising from or relating to the agreement, except those directly attributable to the other party’s income, property, or employment.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 205, "prompt_tokens": 424, "total_tokens": 629, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
