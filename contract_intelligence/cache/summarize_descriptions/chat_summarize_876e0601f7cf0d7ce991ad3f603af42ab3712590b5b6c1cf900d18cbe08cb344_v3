This encompasses a broad range of information, including but not limited to business plans, strategies, financial information, technical data, product plans, designs, roadmaps, customer and supplier information, client data, software (including source code and object code), specifications, documentation, trade secrets, know-how, research and development, security reports, marketing plans, pricing, personal data, and the terms and conditions of the agreement itself.\n\n\"CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\" includes any information that is designated as confidential by the disclosing party or that should reasonably be understood to be confidential, whether disclosed orally, visually, in writing, or in any other form. It may also include information belonging to either party, their affiliates, or third parties, and is subject to specific confidentiality obligations, including restrictions on unauthorized use, disclosure, or misuse by the receiving party, its subcontractors, or service providers.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, \"CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\" must be protected by both parties and, where applicable, by subcontractors. The parties are required to implement appropriate security measures and may seek injunctive, interim, or equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent unauthorized disclosure or use, misappropriation, or threatened misuse of such information. Upon termination or expiration of the agreement, \"CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\" must generally be returned or destroyed by the receiving party, except as required by law or for archival/audit purposes, and subject to specific exceptions outlined in the agreement (such as retaining one archival copy).\n\nThe definition of \"CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\" is typically set forth in Section 5.1, Article V, or other specified clauses of the agreement, and may be referenced in related provisions such as the Publicity Clause, which prohibits the disclosure of such information in marketing or publicity materials by either party. The confidentiality obligations also extend to personal data and client data, with additional privacy protections as referenced in relevant articles of the agreement.\n\nIn summary, \"CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\" refers to all non-public, proprietary, or sensitive information disclosed in connection with the agreement, which must be protected from unauthorized use or disclosure, is subject to return or destruction upon termination, and may be safeguarded by legal remedies including injunctive relief.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 526, "prompt_tokens": 3469, "total_tokens": 3995, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
