This risk encompasses scenarios where Deliverables do not meet contractual requirements, acceptance criteria, or defined documentation, potentially leading to rejection, remediation, or the need for correction and resubmission. To address and mitigate this risk, various contractual mechanisms are employed, including warranty and remedy provisions, acceptance procedures, and obligations for the Vendor, Service Provider, or Acme to correct non-conformities within a reasonable period. Clients or Companies may also have rights to review, reject, request fee adjustments, or obtain refunds if non-conformities are not cured. Overall, the \"RISK OF NON-CONFORMITY\" is managed through a combination of contractual remedies, correction obligations, and acceptance processes to ensure that Deliverables, software, or services ultimately meet the agreed-upon standards and requirements.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 202, "prompt_tokens": 531, "total_tokens": 733, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
