This means that the designated party’s insurance will respond first to claims related to the services provided or acts and omissions under the agreement, and any insurance held by the other party will be considered excess and will not contribute to the coverage. The clause does not limit the obligations of the party providing the primary insurance under the agreement and, in some cases (such as Clause 10.3), specifically applies to the extent of the indemnification obligations of the Vendor. Overall, the \"PRIMARY COVERAGE CLAUSE\" ensures that the specified party’s insurance is the first to respond to claims, with the other party’s insurance only applying after the primary coverage is exhausted.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 193, "prompt_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 458, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
