According to the provided descriptions, deliverables are generally deemed accepted either upon written acceptance by the client or company, or after a specified period if no written notice of material non-conformity is provided. The specified periods vary among the descriptions: one states thirty days, another fifteen business days, and another ten business days. To resolve these contradictions and provide a coherent summary, the \"ACCEPTANCE CONDITION\" can be described as follows:\n\nThe \"ACCEPTANCE CONDITION\" stipulates that deliverables are deemed accepted upon the client's or company's written acceptance, or automatically after a defined period—typically ranging from ten to thirty business days—if no written notice of material non-conformity or rejection is provided by the client (such as Contoso) to the supplier (such as Acme). This condition ensures that acceptance is either explicitly confirmed in writing or implied after the lapse of the specified notification period without objection.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 206, "prompt_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
