Each SOW details specific services, deliverables, milestones, service levels, fees, payment terms, and costs for particular projects or engagements.

They serve as the governing contract for the obligations, remedies, and limitations related to the described services or deliverables, including remedies such as service credits. SOWs can be individually terminated or modified under certain circumstances, such as in the event of non-conforming Deliverables or Work Product, or if a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty days.
