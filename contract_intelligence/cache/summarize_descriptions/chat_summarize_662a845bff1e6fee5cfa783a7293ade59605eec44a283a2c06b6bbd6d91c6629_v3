It generally requires that, if a dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation and escalation, either party may propose or request mediation, or the parties may mutually agree to submit the dispute to mediation. The clause specifies that mediation may be conducted in various locations, including San Francisco County, California; Seattle, Washington; King County, Washington; Dallas, Texas; Wilmington, Delaware; New York, New York; London, UK; and Singapore. In some instances, mediation is administered by specific organizations such as the Singapore Mediation Centre or CEDR, or by another mutually agreed provider or mediator.\n\nThe clause typically requires that mediation be non-binding, meaning the outcome is not enforceable unless the parties reach a settlement. Costs of mediation are generally shared equally between the parties, except for attorneys’ fees, which are borne individually. The clause may specify procedures for mediator selection, the location of mediation, and the administration of the process. In some versions, mediation must be attempted in good faith and is a prerequisite before litigation can be initiated. Overall, the \"MEDIATION CLAUSE\" provides a flexible framework for parties to resolve disputes amicably through mediation in a mutually agreed location and manner, with shared costs and without binding outcomes unless agreed upon.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 279, "prompt_tokens": 669, "total_tokens": 948, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
