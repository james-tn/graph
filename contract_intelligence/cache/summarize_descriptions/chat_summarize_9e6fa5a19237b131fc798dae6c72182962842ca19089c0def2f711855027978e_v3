This risk encompasses several scenarios, including:\n\n- The risk that a party may be unable to perform its obligations due to Force Majeure Events or other unforeseen circumstances, which may excuse or mitigate non-performance under specific contractual clauses.\n- The risk that repeated or material failure to meet agreed milestones or performance standards may constitute a breach of contract, subject to cure provisions and potentially leading to disputes or other consequences.\n- The risk that a Vendor or Service Provider may fail to perform services or deliverables in a professional and timely manner, impacting the operations of the receiving company (such as Contoso or Company).\n- The risk that a Vendor may be unable to meet milestones or performance standards if the Client fails or delays in fulfilling its own responsibilities, thereby affecting the Vendor’s ability to perform.\n- The risk that either party may not fulfill its obligations under the agreement, with such risks potentially mitigated by force majeure and other contractual clauses.\n\nOverall, \"RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE\" captures the various ways in which contractual obligations may not be met, whether due to internal failures, dependencies on the other party’s timely actions, or external events beyond the parties’ control.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 307, "prompt_tokens": 596, "total_tokens": 903, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
