Failure to provide such notification only relieves the Indemnifying Party of its obligations if actual and material prejudice results from the delay. This condition also applies in specific contexts, such as when a Client must notify a Vendor in writing of any non-conformity within a ninety (90) day warranty period to trigger the Vendor's obligation to correct the issue, or when Contoso must notify Vanguard in writing of any breach of the Services Warranty within thirty (30) days after the performance of nonconforming services. Overall, the \"CONDITION OF NOTIFICATION\" ensures that timely written notice is provided to the responsible party to enable them to address claims or breaches, and the obligation to indemnify or correct is contingent upon such notification, except where a delay does not cause actual and material prejudice.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 197, "prompt_tokens": 370, "total_tokens": 567, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
