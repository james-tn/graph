This clause typically requires that any engaged subprocessors or subcontractors are bound by written agreements that impose data protection obligations equivalent to those in the main contract. The Vendor or Service Provider remains fully responsible and liable for the acts and omissions of these subprocessors and must ensure their compliance with all relevant data protection requirements. Specific sub-clauses, such as Clause 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, and 11.8, detail these requirements, including the necessity for written agreements, the Vendor's ongoing responsibility, and, in some cases (e.g., Clause 11.8), the customer’s (such as Contoso’s) right to object to the use of certain subprocessors. Overall, the SUBPROCESSORS CLAUSE ensures that the engagement of subprocessors is tightly controlled and that the protection of Personal Data remains a priority, with the Vendor or Service Provider retaining accountability for compliance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 233, "prompt_tokens": 344, "total_tokens": 577, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
