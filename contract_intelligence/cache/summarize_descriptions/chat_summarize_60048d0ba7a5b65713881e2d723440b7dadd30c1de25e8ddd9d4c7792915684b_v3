These obligations commonly include the return or destruction of Confidential Information, Client Materials, Software, Documentation, or Personal Data. For example, a written request may be required for transition assistance, for obtaining certificates of insurance, or for receiving a list of sub-processors from a vendor or service provider. In some cases, entities such as Nova may require Contoso to certify the deletion or destruction of software and documentation, while the Company may request information or actions from the Service Provider, such as the deletion of Personal Data or provision of a list of sub-processors. The Disclosing Party may also require the Receiving Party to return or destroy Confidential Information upon written request. Overall, \"WRITTEN REQUEST\" serves as the formal mechanism that triggers these contractual obligations and ensures that certain actions, such as the return, deletion, or certification of data and materials, are carried out in accordance with the terms specified in agreements like leases or service contracts.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 225, "prompt_tokens": 360, "total_tokens": 585, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
