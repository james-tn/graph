It refers to all tangible and intangible outputs, products, results, work product, or materials that the Service Provider, Vendor, or other named entity is obligated to create, develop, customize, or deliver to the Client or Company under the Agreement, any Statement of Work (SOW), or Purchase Order (PO).\n\nThese deliverables encompass a wide range of items, including but not limited to reports, analyses, documents, software code, software modules, configurations, models, diagrams, designs, specifications, documentation, training materials, dashboards, data compilations, integration interfaces, test plans, scripts, custom developments, and other work products. Deliverables may also include completed or in-progress items for which the Client or Company has paid or is obligated to pay, and may be subject to change requests, change orders, or change management processes as specified in the Agreement or SOW.\n\nDeliverables are typically required to conform to the specifications, acceptance criteria, and quality requirements set forth in the Agreement and applicable SOWs. They are subject to review, acceptance, and may be referenced in clauses regarding warranties, indemnification, liability, insurance, intellectual property infringement, ownership, licensing, and confidentiality. Ownership of deliverables may vest in the Client or Company upon full payment, except for embedded Vendor Pre-Existing IP, Vendor Tools, Vendor Background IP, or Third-Party Materials, which may be licensed rather than assigned. Deliverables may also be considered Confidential Information and are subject to data processing and protection obligations.\n\nIn summary, “DELIVERABLES” represents the specific outputs, products, results, or work product that the Service Provider or Vendor is required to provide to the Client or Company under the terms of the Agreement and any related SOWs or POs.
