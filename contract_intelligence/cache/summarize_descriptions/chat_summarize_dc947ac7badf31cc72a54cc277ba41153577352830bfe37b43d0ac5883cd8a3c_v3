This clause outlines the obligations of both the Disclosing and Receiving Parties to safeguard confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information—including technical data, business plans, and financial information—from unauthorized use and disclosure.\n\nArticle V provides a comprehensive framework by defining what constitutes Confidential Information and specifying exclusions to this definition. It details the obligations of confidentiality, including restrictions on use and disclosure, and sets forth permitted disclosures and exceptions, such as compelled disclosure by law or regulation. The clause also establishes procedures for the return or destruction of Confidential Information upon request or termination of the Agreement.\n\nAdditionally, Article V addresses remedies for breaches, including the availability of injunctive relief, and stipulates that confidentiality obligations survive the termination or expiration of the Agreement. The clause is referenced as an exception to the limitation of liability, underscoring its importance within the contractual framework.\n\nIn summary, the \"CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSE\" in Article V of the Agreement comprehensively defines Confidential Information, sets out exclusions, details the obligations and permitted disclosures of the Parties, provides for compelled disclosure, return or destruction of information, remedies, and ensures the survival of confidentiality obligations beyond the term of the Agreement.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 278, "prompt_tokens": 793, "total_tokens": 1071, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
