This obligation is typically governed by specific sections of the Agreement, such as Section 5.4, Section 5.5, Section 5.6, Section 11.5, and Article XI, which may outline the procedures and exceptions involved.\n\nThe obligation applies to all tangible and electronic copies of Confidential Information, and in some cases, Personal Data. Exceptions are generally made for retaining one archival or backup copy for legal, compliance, or regulatory purposes, as permitted by the relevant sections of the Agreement. The Receiving Party may also be required to certify the destruction of Confidential Information, as described in certain sections (e.g., Section 4.4.1 and 5.5).\n\nIn summary, the \"OBLIGATION TO RETURN OR DESTROY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\" ensures that, at the conclusion of the business relationship or upon request, each Party safeguards the other’s Confidential Information by returning or destroying it, subject to limited exceptions for legal retention and compliance, and in accordance with the specific provisions of the Agreement.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 271, "prompt_tokens": 887, "total_tokens": 1158, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
