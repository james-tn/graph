Reimbursement is generally subject to the policies of the reimbursing party and may require additional approval for expenses exceeding specified thresholds (e.g., over $1,000). The clause may also specify that each party bears its own expenses, except in cases where one party incurs expenses on behalf of the other, in which case reimbursement is required—sometimes with payment terms such as Net 60. Covered expenses typically include travel and living costs, and all reimbursements must comply with the relevant company or client policies and be properly documented and pre-approved. This clause is often detailed in specific sections, such as Clause 3.7, and is designed to ensure clarity and fairness in the handling of expenses related to service provision.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 226, "prompt_tokens": 338, "total_tokens": 564, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
