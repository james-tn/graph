The Termination for Convenience Clause allows a party, such as the Tenant, to terminate the agreement for convenience, and it typically defines the monetary value of the Early Termination Fee that must be paid to the Service Provider if such a fee is specified in the Statement of Work (SOW). However, the clause also clarifies that Contoso is not liable for any Early Termination Fee in the event of termination for convenience, indicating that the obligation to pay the fee may depend on the specific parties involved or the terms set forth in the SOW. In summary, the Early Termination Fee is generally required for a Tenant to exercise the right to terminate for convenience, as defined by the Termination for Convenience Clause, unless the clause specifically exempts a party, such as Contoso, from this obligation.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 435, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
