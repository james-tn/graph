This risk is specifically identified in the Agreement as a factor that may result in serious consequences, such as bodily injury, death, or property damage. \"WILLFUL MISCONDUCT\" is a key consideration in indemnification obligations for both Vendor and Client, meaning that if such intentional misconduct occurs, the responsible party may be required to indemnify the other. Additionally, this risk is excluded from any limitation of liability provisions, so parties cannot limit their liability for damages resulting from willful misconduct. In cases where willful misconduct is present, the Client may be entitled to remedies beyond standard service credits for breaches of service level agreements (SLAs). Overall, \"WILLFUL MISCONDUCT\" encompasses any intentional wrongful conduct by a party or its personnel that leads to harm or liability under the Agreement, and it significantly impacts the allocation of risk, indemnification, and available remedies between the parties.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 224, "prompt_tokens": 379, "total_tokens": 603, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
