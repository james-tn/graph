These rights include: the Client’s ability to terminate the SOW if the Vendor fails to remedy non-conforming Services or Deliverables within a reasonable period; Contoso’s right to terminate the affected SOW and receive a pro-rata refund if remedies for infringement are not commercially reasonable; and the Company’s right to terminate the SOW upon written notice if infringement cannot be resolved in a commercially reasonable manner. Additionally, either Party has the right to terminate the affected SOW if a Force Majeure Event persists for more than sixty days and materially impacts performance. These provisions collectively ensure that parties have clear recourse to terminate the SOW in cases of unresolved non-conformance, infringement issues, or prolonged force majeure events.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 431, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
