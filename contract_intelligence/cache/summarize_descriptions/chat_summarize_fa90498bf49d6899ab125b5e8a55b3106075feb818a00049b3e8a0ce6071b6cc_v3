Service credits are typically calculated as a percentage of the monthly subscription or recurring fees, based on the actual uptime or service availability achieved. These credits are applied to future invoices and are not redeemable for cash or refunds.\n\nThe clause may specify that service credits are the Client’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for the Vendor’s failure to meet availability targets, though this does not limit other rights under the broader Agreement. There are defined conditions and procedures for requesting credits, including limitations such as caps—commonly set at 10% or 20% of monthly recurring fees per month. Specific sub-clauses (such as Clause 12.3, 12.4, 12.4.1-12.4.2, and 12.5) detail the entitlement, calculation, and application of credits, including scenarios where credits are granted for failure to meet uptime or Severity 1 SLA commitments. Overall, the SERVICE CREDITS CLAUSE ensures that Clients are compensated in the form of future invoice credits when Vendors do not meet agreed-upon service levels.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 307, "prompt_tokens": 598, "total_tokens": 905, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
