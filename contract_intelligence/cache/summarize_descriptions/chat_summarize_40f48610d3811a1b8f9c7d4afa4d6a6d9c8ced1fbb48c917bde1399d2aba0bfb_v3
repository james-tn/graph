The cap amount varies across different agreements: in some instances, it is set at five times the total fees paid or payable by the Client to the Vendor; in others, it is set at two times the total fees paid or payable by the Company to the Service Provider or by the Client to the Vendor. Additionally, Section 9.2 of one agreement specifies a cap of three times the total fees paid or payable by Contoso to Atlas in the twelve months preceding the claim event, with exceptions for excluded claims. Generally, the \"LIABILITY CAP\" serves to limit each party’s aggregate liability, except for certain excluded claims, to a multiple (ranging from two to five times) of the fees paid or payable in the relevant twelve-month period prior to the claim.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 205, "prompt_tokens": 291, "total_tokens": 496, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
