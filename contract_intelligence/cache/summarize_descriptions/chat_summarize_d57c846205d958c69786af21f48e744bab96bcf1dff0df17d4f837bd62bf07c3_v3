Each STATEMENT OF WORK is a document executed by both Parties that references and is governed by the AGREEMENT, and is deemed incorporated by reference. The AGREEMENT contains clauses requiring SOWs to specify detailed project information, including services, deliverables, acceptance criteria, milestones, delivery dates, timelines, fees, payment schedules, and other project-specific terms. SOWs define the scope of individual projects or engagements, and may be terminated independently. The AGREEMENT references, incorporates, and governs all SOWs, which detail the specific requirements, terms, and deliverables for each engagement or project phase. In summary, the AGREEMENT establishes the overarching terms, while each STATEMENT OF WORK supplements the AGREEMENT by specifying the detailed requirements, services, deliverables, criteria, and payment terms for individual projects executed by the Parties.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 827, "total_tokens": 1030, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
