It typically imposes interest on overdue amounts, with rates commonly set at 1% per month or up to the maximum rate permitted by law, and may also include a late charge of five percent (5%) as a reasonable estimate of administrative costs. The clause applies to undisputed amounts, with exceptions made for validly disputed payments.\n\nIn addition to interest and late charges, the clause grants the Vendor or Service Provider the right to suspend services, withhold deliverables, or, in cases of material breach, terminate the Agreement or Statement of Work (SOW). Suspension of services is generally subject to written notice and an opportunity for the Client to cure the non-payment before remedies are enforced. The clause may also specify that only non-critical services can be suspended, and it often limits the Service Provider’s remedies for non-payment.\n\nFurther, the clause may provide for the recovery of collection costs incurred due to late payment. It applies to various types of payments, including rent or other sums due under the agreement. Overall, the \"LATE PAYMENT CLAUSE\" ensures that the Vendor or Service Provider has clear, enforceable rights and procedures for addressing late payments, while also affording the Client notice and a chance to remedy the default before penalties or service suspensions are imposed.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 278, "prompt_tokens": 747, "total_tokens": 1025, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
