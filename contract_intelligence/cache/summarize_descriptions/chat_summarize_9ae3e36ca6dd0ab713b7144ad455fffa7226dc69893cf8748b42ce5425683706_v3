This right typically requires the provider to give written notice to the client, and in some cases, an opportunity to cure the late payment. The suspension may occur if undisputed amounts remain unpaid for more than thirty (30) days after the due date, or, in certain agreements, for more than fifteen days after written notice. In addition to suspending services, the provider may also withhold deliverables, disable access to systems, or, in some cases, terminate the agreement or statement of work (SOW) due to non-payment. This right is designed to protect the service provider from continued non-payment while ensuring the client is given notice and a chance to resolve outstanding balances.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 200, "prompt_tokens": 430, "total_tokens": 630, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
