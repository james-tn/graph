This clause explicitly supersedes and replaces all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, representations, and communications, whether written or oral, between the Parties regarding the subject matter of the Agreement. Its purpose is to ensure that no previous or external documents, negotiations, or representations have any legal effect, and that the rights and obligations of the Parties are governed solely by the Agreement and its incorporated documents. This clause may appear in various forms, including in Consulting Services Agreements and leases, but consistently serves to consolidate all relevant contractual terms and to prevent reliance on prior agreements or communications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 222, "prompt_tokens": 1092, "total_tokens": 1314, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
