The cap is typically based on the amount of fees or payments made in the preceding twelve months. Common formulations include limiting liability to the amount of fees paid or payable by the Client to the Vendor, two times the total amounts of base rent and additional rent paid by the Tenant to the Landlord, or up to five times the total fees paid or payable by the Client to the Vendor. These caps generally apply except for certain excluded claims, which are not subject to the liability limitation. The specific multiplier and payment basis may vary depending on the context of the agreement, but the primary purpose of the \"CAP ON LIABILITY\" is to restrict each party’s financial exposure under the contract.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 394, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
