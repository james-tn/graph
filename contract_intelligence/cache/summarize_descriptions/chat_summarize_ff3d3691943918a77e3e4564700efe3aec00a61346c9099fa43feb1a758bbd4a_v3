SOWs are subsidiary or subordinate contracts that define the specific scope, requirements, services, deliverables, milestones, project phases, schedules, acceptance procedures, and fee structures for particular projects or engagements under the Agreement. The Agreement may automatically terminate all SOWs in effect unless otherwise stated, and termination of the Agreement may also result in the termination of subordinate SOWs. SOWs may be amended by the Agreement and its Change Orders, and they may specify additional terms, exceptions, and specifications as needed. Each SOW sets forth project-specific details, including service levels, work product requirements, payment terms, and obligations, and may be renewed or terminated according to the terms of the Agreement.
