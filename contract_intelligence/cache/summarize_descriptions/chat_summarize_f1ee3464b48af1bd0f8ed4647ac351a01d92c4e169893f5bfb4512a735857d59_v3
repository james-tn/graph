This term also encompasses courts referenced in the Injunctive Relief Clause, where either party may seek equitable or injunctive remedies, and courts with authority to rule on matters involving Confidential Information or Intellectual Property Rights, such as IP infringement remedies.\n\nAdditionally, a \"COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION\" includes any court with the legal authority to enforce arbitral awards, enter judgment on arbitration decisions, or grant interim, provisional, or preliminary injunctive relief under the Agreement.
