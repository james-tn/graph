Such events include, but are not limited to, acts of God, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes), war, terrorism, civil unrest, epidemics or pandemics, governmental actions or regulatory changes, labor disputes (excluding those involving the affected party’s own workforce), power failures, failures of telecommunications, utilities, or networks, widespread internet outages, and failures of third-party service or hosting providers.\n\nA Force Majeure Event may excuse a Party from performance or delay obligations under the Agreement, except for payment obligations, and may also exclude certain outages from service credit eligibility under Service Level Agreements (SLA) or uptime commitments. In the context of leases, such events may materially prevent a tenant from using the premises for its intended purpose for a specified period (e.g., more than 180 consecutive days). The occurrence of a Force Majeure Event is intended to protect parties from liability for non-performance or delays caused by extraordinary, unforeseen circumstances outside their control.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 267, "prompt_tokens": 1267, "total_tokens": 1534, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
