This term encompasses entities affiliated with or related to various parties, including Contoso Enterprises, Vanguard Solutions, Inc., Vertex Group, LLC, Epsilon Group, Atlas Ventures, LLC, Acme Corp, Pinnacle Services, Quantum Labs LLC, and the Vendor. An AFFILIATE may receive assignment or subletting of the Agreement, Statement of Work (SOW), or lease without the prior written consent of the other party or the Landlord, provided certain conditions are met. These conditions typically require the Affiliate to assume all obligations under the Agreement or SOW and, in some cases, to agree in writing to be bound by the terms of the Agreement. Assignments to an AFFILIATE may also occur in connection with corporate events such as mergers, acquisitions, corporate reorganizations, or sales of assets. Additionally, AFFILIATES may be treated as beneficiaries under certain provisions of the Agreement. The Assignment Clause specifies the circumstances under which such assignments or novations are permitted, ensuring that the rights and obligations of the original parties are maintained by the AFFILIATE.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 250, "prompt_tokens": 684, "total_tokens": 934, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
