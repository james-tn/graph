This clause typically covers claims arising from breaches of the agreement, intellectual property infringement, misconduct, violations of law, provision of infringing materials, and instructions regarding personal data.\n\nThe clause details the procedures and remedies for indemnification, including the obligations of the indemnifying party to defend, cooperate, and refrain from settling claims without the consent of the indemnified party. It also specifies the rights of the indemnified party regarding the management of claims. The scope of indemnification may favor one party in certain agreements, but generally, it is structured as a mutual obligation.\n\nThe indemnification clause is referenced in survival provisions, ensuring that these obligations persist beyond the termination or expiration of the agreement. In some instances, the clause requires specific parties, such as Contoso, to indemnify designated indemnitees (e.g., Vanguard Indemnitees) for claims arising from particular activities, such as the use of software or services in violation of the agreement or law.\n\nOverall, the \"INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSE\" in Article VIII comprehensively outlines the allocation of risk between the parties, the scope of indemnification, and the procedures for addressing third-party claims, thereby providing a framework for protecting each party and their affiliates from specified liabilities.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 335, "prompt_tokens": 870, "total_tokens": 1205, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
