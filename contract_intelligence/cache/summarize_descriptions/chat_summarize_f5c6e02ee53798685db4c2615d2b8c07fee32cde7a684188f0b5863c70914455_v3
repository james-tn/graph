This clause establishes performance metrics and expectations, referencing service levels set forth in Article XII of the Lease and applicable Statements of Work (SOWs). It requires service providers, including Acme, to perform services with skill, care, diligence, and professionalism, in accordance with specified service levels and applicable law. The clause details required service uptime percentages and outlines corresponding service credits for failures to meet those levels. Article XII further specifies standards for building services, uptime targets, response times, and remedies for breaches of service levels. Clause 2.5.3 allows the parties to agree on specific service levels and performance metrics within an SOW, subject to certain exclusions and remedies. Additionally, the clause in Article XII sets forth the required service levels, performance standards, and Service Level Agreement (SLA) commitments that Vanguard must meet or exceed. Overall, the SERVICE LEVELS CLAUSE ensures that all parties are held to clearly defined standards of performance, with mechanisms for accountability and remedies in case of non-compliance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 240, "prompt_tokens": 317, "total_tokens": 557, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
