This clause requires the Service Provider or Vendor to comply with applicable Data Protection Laws when transferring Personal Data across national borders. It mandates the implementation of appropriate data transfer mechanisms, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, and may require obtaining consent for transfers to countries without adequate protection. The clause also obligates cooperation between the Parties to ensure the necessary safeguards are in place for cross-border data transfers. Specifically, Clause 11.8 requires the Vendor to ensure compliance with Data Protection Laws during such transfers, while Clause 11.9 requires the Parties to implement suitable data transfer mechanisms for transfers from the EEA, UK, or Switzerland to countries lacking adequate protection.
