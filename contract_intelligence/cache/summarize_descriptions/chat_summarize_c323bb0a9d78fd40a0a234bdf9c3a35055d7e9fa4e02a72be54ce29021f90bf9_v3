According to the various descriptions, the clause allows either party to submit disputes that remain unresolved after mediation to arbitration administered by either the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), depending on the specific agreement. The arbitration may be conducted in different locations, including Seattle, Washington; Wilmington, Delaware; San Francisco, California; or Singapore, with the applicable rules of the chosen arbitration institution (AAA or SIAC) governing the proceedings.\n\nIn some versions, the clause specifies that arbitration will be administered by the AAA, with proceedings held in Seattle, Wilmington, or San Francisco, and may involve a panel of three arbitrators with the authority to award both damages and equitable relief. In other versions, the clause requires that unresolved disputes be finally and bindingly resolved by arbitration administered by SIAC, with the seat of arbitration in Singapore and the award being final and binding.\n\nOverall, the \"ARBITRATION CLAUSE\" provides for binding arbitration as the final method of dispute resolution, administered by either AAA or SIAC, in a specified location, and ensures that the resulting judgment or award is enforceable in courts of competent jurisdiction. The clause may also include provisions for the number of arbitrators and the types of relief that may be awarded.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 279, "prompt_tokens": 344, "total_tokens": 623, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
