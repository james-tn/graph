The term \"Party,\" as defined within the Statement of Work, refers to the contracting entities involved. While one description identifies Contoso Enterprises and Pinnacle Services as the Parties entering into the Statement of Work, another defines \"Party\" as referring to Contoso Enterprises and Epsilon Group. To resolve this contradiction, it can be concluded that the Statement of Work involves Contoso Enterprises as a consistent contracting entity, with the other Party being either Pinnacle Services or Epsilon Group, depending on the specific context or version of the agreement. Therefore, the Statement of Work is an agreement entered into by Contoso Enterprises and another contracting entity, which may be Pinnacle Services or Epsilon Group, with \"Party\" referring to each of these entities as defined within the Statement of Work.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 357, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
