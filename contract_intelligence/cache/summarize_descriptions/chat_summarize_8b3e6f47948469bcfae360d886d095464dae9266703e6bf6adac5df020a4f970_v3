When gross negligence occurs—defined as serious disregard or reckless indifference to contractual duties—it triggers indemnification obligations, meaning the responsible party must compensate for losses caused by such conduct. Additionally, gross negligence serves as an exception to the limitations of liability, including aggregate liability caps, as specified in various sections (such as Article IX, Section 9.2, and Section 9.3). This means that if either party, such as Vendor, Client, Atlas, or Phoenix, acts with gross negligence or willful misconduct, the usual liability limitations do not apply, and additional remedies may be available to the affected party (e.g., Contoso in the case of Phoenix’s serious carelessness). In summary, \"GROSS NEGLIGENCE\" is a severe form of negligence that, when present, overrides standard liability limitations and triggers indemnification and other remedies under the agreement.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 204, "prompt_tokens": 407, "total_tokens": 611, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
