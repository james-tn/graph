In various contexts, RISK ALLOCATION may pertain to the relationship between Contoso and Acme, or between Landlord and Tenant, with the allocation reflected in the agreement’s terms, fees, and limitations of liability. The allocation is considered a fair basis for transactions with a medium risk profile, particularly in landlord-tenant arrangements. However, in some agreements, the distribution of risk is described as heavily Vendor-favorable, indicating that the terms may disproportionately benefit the vendor. Overall, RISK ALLOCATION is determined by the negotiated limitations, exclusions, and insurance provisions, shaping the responsibilities and protections of each party within the agreement.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 165, "prompt_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 411, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
