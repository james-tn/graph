This risk encompasses the possibility that the Service Provider may not meet required service availability levels, resulting in service downtime. However, this risk is mitigated through various mechanisms, including service level obligations, uptime commitments, maintenance and support services, and remedies such as service credits. Scheduled maintenance, emergency maintenance, force majeure events, and other factors beyond the Service Provider’s reasonable control are generally excluded from the definition of downtime. Specific terms, such as those described in Clause 2.5.3, outline permitted downtime and related exclusions. Overall, the risk of service downtime is managed through contractual commitments to service availability and procedures designed to minimize operational impact on Contoso.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 183, "prompt_tokens": 347, "total_tokens": 530, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
