This obligation primarily applies to the Receiving Party, who must use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information solely for the purposes of performing obligations or exercising rights under the Agreement, or for receiving or providing services as specified. The Receiving Party is required to protect Confidential Information with reasonable care, restrict its disclosure, and ensure it is not used for any other purpose except as expressly permitted by the Agreement.\n\nDisclosure of Confidential Information to third parties is strictly limited; it may only occur as permitted by the Agreement, and access must be restricted to individuals with a legitimate need who are themselves bound by written confidentiality and data protection terms that are no less protective than those in the Agreement. This includes ensuring that all subcontractors and authorized persons processing Personal Data are subject to confidentiality obligations and, where applicable, receive appropriate data protection training.\n\nThe obligation extends to maintaining the confidentiality of Confidential Information for a period of five years after the termination of the Agreement, and for trade secrets, for as long as they remain trade secrets. Specific parties, such as Phoenix and Vanguard, are required to ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data are bound by confidentiality commitments or statutory obligations. Vendors, such as those referenced in Article V and the Residuals clause, must also maintain the confidentiality of the Client’s Confidential Information.\n\nOverall, the \"OBLIGATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY\" ensures that Confidential Information is used only as necessary for the Agreement, protected from unauthorized use or disclosure, and that all individuals with access are appropriately bound by similar confidentiality obligations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 335, "prompt_tokens": 586, "total_tokens": 921, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
