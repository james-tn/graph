Notification timelines vary by entity: Acme must notify Contoso within 48 hours of any actual or suspected personal data breach, while Phoenix is required to notify Contoso within 72 hours, and Summit Tech must notify Contoso without undue delay. The obligation applies to both confirmed unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal data and suspected breaches.\n\nUpon notification, the responsible party must provide relevant information about the breach, cooperate fully in the investigation, containment, and remediation efforts, and assist with notifications to authorities or affected individuals as required. Each party is expected to bear its own costs related to the breach unless the breach is caused by the other party’s negligence. Additionally, Phoenix must restrict third-party notifications without Contoso’s consent. The Service Provider is also required to mitigate the effects of any data breach and cooperate with the Company in all related notifications. These obligations may be further detailed under specific contractual clauses, such as Clause 11.6 for Vendors, which mandates notification to the Client in the event of a data breach.\n\nOverall, the DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION OBLIGATION ensures timely communication, cooperation, and mitigation between parties in the event of a data breach, with specific requirements tailored to the roles and relationships of the entities involved.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 296, "prompt_tokens": 356, "total_tokens": 652, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
