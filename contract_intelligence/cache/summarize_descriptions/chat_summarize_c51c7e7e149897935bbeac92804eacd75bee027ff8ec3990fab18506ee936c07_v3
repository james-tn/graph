These events typically include, but are not limited to, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes), acts of God, war, terrorism, pandemics or epidemics, civil unrest, strikes or labor disputes, governmental actions, utility failures, power outages, and failures of third-party providers. When a FORCE MAJEURE EVENT occurs, it may excuse or delay a party’s performance under the relevant contract, as defined in specific sections or articles (such as Section 15.1 or Article XV) of the agreement. The concept is designed to address extraordinary risks and disruptions that are outside the control of the affected party, ensuring that obligations are adjusted fairly in the face of unforeseen and uncontrollable circumstances.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 197, "prompt_tokens": 615, "total_tokens": 812, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
