It is specifically excluded from the definition of a Force Majeure Event when caused by the affected party’s own actions. In indemnification clauses, willful misconduct serves as a trigger for indemnification obligations, meaning that if either party intentionally violates their duties under the agreement, indemnification may be required.\n\nFurthermore, willful misconduct is consistently excepted from limitations of liability; liability for such conduct cannot be limited or excluded under the agreement. This condition also limits a client’s indemnification obligation, excluding losses directly caused by a vendor’s willful misconduct. If a party acts with willful misconduct, the aggregate liability cap and other limitations of liability, as defined in relevant sections (such as Section 9.2, Section 9.3, and Article IX), do not apply. This ensures that intentional wrongdoing or deliberate violation of obligations by either party results in full liability and may trigger additional remedies, such as when Phoenix intentionally fails to meet its obligations, potentially allowing Contoso to seek further recourse.\n\nIn summary, \"WILLFUL MISCONDUCT\" is a contractual condition that refers to intentional wrongdoing by either party, and when present, it triggers indemnification obligations and removes any limitations or caps on liability, ensuring that parties remain fully accountable for losses or damages resulting from their deliberate actions.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 295, "prompt_tokens": 481, "total_tokens": 776, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
