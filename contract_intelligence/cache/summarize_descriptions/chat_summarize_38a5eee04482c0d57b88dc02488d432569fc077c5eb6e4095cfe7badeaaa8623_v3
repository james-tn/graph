Such events include, but are not limited to, acts of God, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods, or storms), pandemics, epidemics, war, terrorism, civil unrest, strikes or labor disputes (excluding those involving the affected Party’s own workforce), government actions or orders, embargoes, power outages, failures or outages of third-party telecommunications or internet service providers, utility failures, and other major system disruptions. These occurrences may excuse performance, extend project timelines, or impact service availability and obligations under the Agreement or Lease. Events caused by the affected Party’s own negligence or misconduct are excluded from this definition. In certain contexts, such as the Permitted Downtime Clause, a FORCE MAJEURE EVENT may also refer to service unavailability or failures outside the control of the parties, and may limit the liability of service providers like Summit Tech or Gamma.
