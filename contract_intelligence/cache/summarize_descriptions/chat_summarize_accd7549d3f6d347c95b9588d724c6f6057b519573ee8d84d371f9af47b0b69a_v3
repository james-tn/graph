Specifically, it requires that a party materially breaches the agreement, and if the breach is capable of being cured, the breaching party must fail to cure the breach within thirty (30) days of receiving notice. If the material breach is incapable of cure, the non-breaching party may terminate the agreement or SOW immediately. For example, Vanguard may terminate the agreement immediately if Contoso materially breaches its payment obligations and fails to cure within thirty days. Additionally, this condition allows the Vendor to revoke the Client’s license to Work Product in the event of a material breach. Overall, termination for cause is contingent upon a material breach and the failure to cure within the specified thirty-day period, or if the breach cannot be cured at all.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 183, "prompt_tokens": 273, "total_tokens": 456, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
