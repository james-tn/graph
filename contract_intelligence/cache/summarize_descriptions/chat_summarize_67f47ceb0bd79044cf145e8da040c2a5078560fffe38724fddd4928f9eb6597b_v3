Within the context of the Agreement, a \"CHANGE ORDER\" is a defined term referring to a formal, mutually agreed amendment that modifies the Agreement or an applicable SOW. Change Orders are used to alter the contract value, milestones, scope, fees, or other terms and obligations, including the scope of transition assistance. \n\nThe Agreement contains specific provisions requiring that any Change Requests must be documented in signed Change Orders to become effective. Once approved and executed, a Change Order amends the relevant SOW and becomes an integral part of the Agreement, with all Change Orders incorporated by reference into the Agreement. Thus, Change Orders serve as referenced documents that formally modify or add to the Agreement’s terms and obligations, ensuring that any changes to the scope or terms of services are properly documented and governed by the Agreement.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 352, "total_tokens": 548, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
