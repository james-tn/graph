This clause generally permits these entities to engage sub-processors, provided that the sub-processors are bound by written agreements imposing data protection obligations that are at least as protective as those outlined in the main agreement or Data Processing Addendum (DPA). The clause typically requires that the engaging entity—whether Acme, Vendor, or the Service Provider—remains fully liable and responsible for the acts and omissions of any sub-processors.\n\nSpecific provisions, such as Clause 11.4, authorize or permit the Service Provider or Vendor to engage sub-processors, subject to the condition that equivalent data protection obligations are imposed on them. Clause 11.6 further stipulates that the Service Provider may engage sub-processors under certain conditions, including the requirement for written agreements, ongoing liability, notification to the Company, and the Company’s right to object to the engagement of specific sub-processors. In some cases, the clause restricts the Service Provider from engaging sub-processors without compliance with the DPA and obtaining the Company’s consent.\n\nOverall, the \"SUB-PROCESSORS CLAUSE\" ensures that any subcontractors involved in processing Personal Data are subject to robust data protection standards, and that the primary contracting entity remains accountable for their performance and compliance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 299, "prompt_tokens": 403, "total_tokens": 702, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
