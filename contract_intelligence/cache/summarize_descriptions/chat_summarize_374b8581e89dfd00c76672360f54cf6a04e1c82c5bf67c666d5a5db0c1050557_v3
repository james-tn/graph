This obligation includes taking steps to resume performance as soon as practicable or reasonably possible. In some contexts, such as upon termination for convenience, the Service Provider is specifically required to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate disruption to the Company. Additionally, under Clause 15.2(b), the affected Party is explicitly required to mitigate the effects of a Force Majeure Event. In a separate context, Phoenix has a mitigation obligation to ensure that the use of open source software does not subject Deliverables or Contoso proprietary software to copyleft or similar license requirements. Overall, the MITIGATION OBLIGATION encompasses the duty to minimize adverse impacts and resume contractual performance promptly, using reasonable commercial efforts, in various scenarios including Force Majeure Events and software licensing.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 191, "prompt_tokens": 419, "total_tokens": 610, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
