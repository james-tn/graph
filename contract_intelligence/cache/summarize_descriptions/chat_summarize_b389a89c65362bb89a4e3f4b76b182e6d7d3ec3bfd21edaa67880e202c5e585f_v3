Each SOW is a defined term within the Agreement and is subordinate to its terms. SOWs are individual documents, often referenced as attachments or addenda, that specify detailed scope, services, deliverables, payment terms, milestones, project schedules, and other specific obligations between the parties. The Agreement allows for the creation, amendment (including via Change Orders), and termination of individual SOWs, which may be modified separately and may define exceptions, additional services, or specific requirements for deliverables and products.\n\nSOWs are subject to the Agreement’s termination and renewal provisions and may be terminated in whole or in part under certain conditions, such as infringement claims, non-conforming deliverables, or if a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty days. SOWs may also automatically expire with the termination of the Agreement, unless otherwise specified, and may remain in effect independently in some cases. The Agreement includes SOWs as part of the entire contract, and they are considered within the definition of Confidential Information. SOWs may specify additional fees, roles, obligations, remedies, service levels, and license terms, and are subject to indemnification and other contractual provisions.\n\nIn summary, the Agreement governs all aspects of SOWs, which detail the specific commitments, costs, services, deliverables, and terms for each engagement between the parties, and provides mechanisms for their amendment, termination, and renewal under various circumstances.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 314, "prompt_tokens": 1367, "total_tokens": 1681, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
