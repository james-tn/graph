These circumstances include assignment to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all assets, provided that the assignee assumes all obligations under the agreement. In some cases, such as with Contoso, the right to assign extends to any affiliate or successor in interest without requiring Summit Tech’s consent. Additionally, the Vendor may have the right to assign the agreement under certain conditions, while the Client’s right to assign may be restricted and require the Vendor’s consent. Overall, the right to assign is designed to facilitate business transitions while ensuring that the assignee remains responsible for fulfilling all contractual obligations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 317, "total_tokens": 478, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
