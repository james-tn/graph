Change Orders are typically executed by authorized representatives of both Parties and require mutual written agreement. They may take the form of amendments, addenda, or orders, and are incorporated by reference into the Agreement, Statement of Work (SOW), or Purchase Order (PO), becoming part of the entire contract upon execution.\n\nThe Change Order process is governed by specific clauses in the Agreement, such as the Change Management Clause (often referenced in Article XIII or Sections 13.1 and 13.2), the Entire Agreement Clause, and the Priority of Documents Clause. Change Orders are used to formalize and authorize changes requested via a Change Request, detailing the nature, impact, and terms of the proposed change, including adjustments to scope, deliverables, timelines, fees, resources, and other contractual provisions. In urgent circumstances, a Change Order may be authorized via email and formalized thereafter.\n\nChange Orders prevail over the SOW in case of conflict and are required for material modifications, especially after repeated correction cycles or when significant changes to deliverables, contract value, or project milestones are necessary. They ensure that all agreed changes are documented, approved, and binding, thereby protecting the rights and obligations of both Parties under the Agreement.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 302, "prompt_tokens": 2176, "total_tokens": 2478, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
