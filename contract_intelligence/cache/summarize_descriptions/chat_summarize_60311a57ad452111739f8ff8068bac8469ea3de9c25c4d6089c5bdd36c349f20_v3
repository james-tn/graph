These disputes can pertain to the interpretation, performance, or execution of the contract or agreement, and may specifically include issues such as payment or invoice amounts. The risk encompasses disputes between clients and vendors, or other parties, and may result in delayed payments or require continued service obligations during the resolution process. To address and mitigate this risk, agreements typically include procedures for notification, cooperation, and defined dispute resolution mechanisms such as negotiation, mediation, arbitration, or litigation. The presence of a Dispute Resolution Clause or similar provisions in the agreement helps ensure that any disagreements or claims are managed in an orderly manner, minimizing disruption and facilitating resolution.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 163, "prompt_tokens": 503, "total_tokens": 666, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
