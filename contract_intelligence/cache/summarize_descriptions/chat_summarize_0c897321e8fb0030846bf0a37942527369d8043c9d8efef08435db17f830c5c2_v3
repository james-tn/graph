This clause specifies the roles of entities such as the Client, Contoso, and Gamma in the review and acceptance process. It includes defined review or acceptance periods (often referred to as the Acceptance Period or Review Period), during which the Client or Contoso evaluates the deliverables against established criteria. If non-conformities or deficiencies are identified, the clause details the procedures for notification, correction, and remedying such issues, including timelines for correction and alternatives if deliverables cannot be corrected.
