These claims typically include third-party allegations of infringement related to deliverables, products, or services, as well as regulatory or governmental actions. The obligation is generally set forth in Article VIII or Section 8.1(a) of the relevant agreement and is often referenced in the preamble, insurance, and risk allocation clauses.\n\nThis indemnification obligation is designed to allocate risk between the parties and may be interpreted broadly in favor of the Vendor, sometimes including uncapped liability and specific protections regarding indemnity and intellectual property rights. The obligation survives the termination or expiration of the agreement or lease, as specified in the Survival Clause, and is typically excluded from any limitation of liability provisions. While the obligation may be subject to certain exclusions and limitations as detailed in the agreement, it requires the indemnifying party to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the other party against covered claims. Each party may have reciprocal indemnification responsibilities, subject to the limits and exceptions set forth in the agreement or lease.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 247, "prompt_tokens": 491, "total_tokens": 738, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
