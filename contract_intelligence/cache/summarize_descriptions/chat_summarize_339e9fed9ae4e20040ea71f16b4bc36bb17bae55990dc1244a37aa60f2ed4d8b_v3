Across various descriptions, the clause is presented in multiple forms, specifying different governing jurisdictions depending on the context or version of the agreement.\n\nCommonly, the \"GOVERNING LAW CLAUSE\" specifies that the agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of a particular jurisdiction, often explicitly excluding conflict of law principles or choice of law rules to ensure that only the named jurisdiction's laws apply. The jurisdictions referenced in the provided descriptions include the State of California (with several clauses and sections, such as Section 16.1, Article XVI, Section 16.1, Clause 14.5, Clause 16.1, Section 16.8, and Section 16.9), the State of Delaware (Clause 16.1, Clause 16.8), the State of Texas, the State of Washington, the State of New York, the Republic of Singapore, and England and Wales.\n\nSome clauses extend the governing law to related disputes or statements of work (SOW), and may also specify that arbitration is the exclusive forum for dispute resolution or exclude the application of international conventions such as the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.\n\nIn summary, the \"GOVERNING LAW CLAUSE\" is a contractual provision that designates the laws of a specific jurisdiction—most frequently the State of California, but also Delaware, Texas, Washington, New York, Singapore, and England and Wales—as the governing law for the agreement and any related disputes, typically excluding conflict of law principles to avoid the application of other jurisdictions’ laws. The clause may also address dispute resolution mechanisms and the survival of the clause beyond termination or expiration of the agreement. The specific jurisdiction named in the clause should be referenced in the agreement itself, as it may vary depending on the parties and context.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 405, "prompt_tokens": 888, "total_tokens": 1293, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
