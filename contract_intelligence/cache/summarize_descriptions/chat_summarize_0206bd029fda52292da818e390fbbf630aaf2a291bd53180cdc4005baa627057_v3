This condition applies in several scenarios, including termination of the Agreement due to a Force Majeure Event that continues for more than sixty days, where prior written notice is required. The Client must provide thirty (30) days’ prior written notice before exercising the right to terminate an affected Service or Statement of Work (SOW), and similarly, thirty days’ prior written notice is required before terminating an SOW for chronic Service Level Agreement (SLA) failures. In cases of termination for convenience, a more extended notice period of one hundred eighty (180) days’ prior written notice is required. Additionally, prior written notice is necessary before certain actions such as assignment, subletting, or assessment of interest. Overall, \"PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE\" ensures that parties are informed in advance—typically ranging from thirty to one hundred eighty days depending on the action—before significant contractual changes or terminations are executed.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 218, "prompt_tokens": 300, "total_tokens": 518, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
