It also details procedures for changing notice addresses and may specify when notices are considered effective upon delivery. The clause may appear as Clause 16.5, 16.6, 16.7, 16.8, or 16.9, depending on the agreement, and applies to both the main agreement and related documents such as Statements of Work.
