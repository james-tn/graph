These risks may arise from various circumstances, including intellectual property infringement, data protection breaches, bodily injury, gross negligence, willful misconduct, violation of law, or breach of contract. Specifically, third-party claims may result from the Client’s use and operation of the Services and Deliverables, with such risks primarily allocated to the Client.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, the Agreement includes a No Third-Party Beneficiaries Clause, which expressly excludes third parties from claiming rights or remedies under the Agreement or Statement of Work (SOW), except for indemnified parties as specified in Section 16.9. Indemnification obligations further address liabilities related to third-party claims, ensuring that only designated parties may seek remedies. Overall, the \"RISK OF THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS\" encompasses the possibility that either party may face legal or financial consequences due to actions or assertions by entities not party to the Agreement, with contractual provisions in place to limit such exposure.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 240, "prompt_tokens": 485, "total_tokens": 725, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
