To exercise this right, the client must provide written notice to the vendor (such as Nova) specifying the disputed amount and the basis for the dispute. The notification period varies, with some descriptions specifying ten (10) business days from the invoice date and others specifying fifteen (15) business days from receipt of the invoice. During the dispute process, the client is required to pay only the undisputed portion of the invoice within the agreed payment term.
