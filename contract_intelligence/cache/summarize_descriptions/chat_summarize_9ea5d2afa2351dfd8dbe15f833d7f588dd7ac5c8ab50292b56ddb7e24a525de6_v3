This risk encompasses scenarios where delays may arise due to the Company's (including entities such as Contoso, its affiliates, or third-party providers) failure to provide necessary access, data, approvals, resources, or to fulfill its responsibilities. It also includes delays resulting from the Client's lack of cooperation, withheld approvals, changes in scope, or failure to meet obligations, which may impact the Vendor’s ability to perform services on schedule or deliver agreed milestones and deliverables.\n\nAdditionally, \"RISK OF DELAY\" covers circumstances where delays are caused by Force Majeure events or other unforeseen factors, such as personnel replacement, which may materially impact project timelines, service levels, or the achievement of business objectives. In cases where delays are attributable to the Company, Client, or third parties, adjustments to schedules or fees may occur as specified in contractual provisions (e.g., Article XIII), and the Vendor is not liable for such delays. Overall, \"RISK OF DELAY\" highlights the importance of timely cooperation, provision of required information, and fulfillment of responsibilities by all parties to mitigate the impact on project outcomes and service performance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 258, "prompt_tokens": 570, "total_tokens": 828, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
