Specifically, it mandates that insurance policies may not be canceled or materially changed without providing at least thirty days’ written notice to the other party, such as Contoso. Vanguard is required to give Contoso thirty days’ prior written notice in the event of cancellation or material reduction in insurance coverage. Similarly, Nova must use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Contoso with thirty days’ notice of any cancellation or material reduction in insurance coverage. Additionally, this notice period applies to either party wishing to terminate affected Statements of Work (SOWs) following a prolonged Force Majeure Event.
