According to Clause 6.1, the Company (or Client, such as Contoso) acquires all rights, title, and interest in the deliverables upon full payment, with exceptions for Service Provider or Vendor Tools, Vendor Background IP, and third-party materials embedded in the deliverables. Section 6.2 further addresses ownership, specifying that while the Company is granted a license to use the deliverables, the Vendor or Service Provider retains ownership of intellectual property rights in certain aspects of the deliverables, particularly those involving embedded third-party or Service Provider IP. The clause also notes that all intellectual property rights in the work product may be owned exclusively by the Service Provider, subject to specific sections and exceptions. Overall, the clause establishes that ownership of deliverables generally transfers to the Company upon payment, but excludes pre-existing Vendor or third-party intellectual property, with the Company typically receiving a license to use these excluded elements.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 325, "total_tokens": 541, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
