This clause generally restricts either Party from assigning or transferring the Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party. However, there are specific exceptions: assignment is permitted without consent in cases involving Affiliates, or in connection with certain corporate transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, corporate reorganizations, or sales of assets, provided that the assignee or successor agrees in writing to be bound by all terms and obligations of the Agreement.\n\nFor Contoso, the clause allows assignment to any Affiliate or successor without Summit Tech’s consent, as long as written notice is provided. Conversely, Summit Tech (or the Vendor) may assign the Agreement to Affiliates or in connection with corporate transactions, often with notice to the Client (or Company), while the Client’s ability to assign is more restricted and typically requires the Vendor’s prior written consent except in the aforementioned circumstances.\n\nThe clause also prohibits assignment to direct competitors and declares any attempted assignment in violation of its terms to be null and void. Successors and permitted assigns are bound by the Agreement, and unauthorized assignments have no legal effect. In summary, the ASSIGNMENT CLAUSE provides a balanced framework for assignment and transfer, ensuring that both Parties’ interests are protected while allowing flexibility for legitimate corporate changes.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 320, "prompt_tokens": 1276, "total_tokens": 1596, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
