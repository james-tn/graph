Specifically, Nova is obligated to refund the pro rata portion of prepaid license or subscription fees for periods beyond the effective date of termination, with the exception of any non-refundable fees. Additionally, the Vendor has a duty to refund the Client any prepaid fees for services not yet performed if the Statement of Work (SOW) is terminated due to intellectual property (IP) infringement remedies. Thus, the obligation encompasses both the refund of unused prepaid fees upon termination and specific scenarios such as termination due to IP infringement, while recognizing that some fees may be designated as non-refundable.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 152, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 347, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
