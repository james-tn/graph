Deliverables must materially conform to the specifications and requirements outlined in the applicable Statement of Work (SOW) or Agreement. Acceptance is typically achieved through one of the following: written acceptance by the Company or Client; expiration of the review or acceptance period (usually ten (10) Business Days) without the Company or Client providing written notice of material non-conformity or rejection; or use of the Deliverable in production for thirty consecutive days.\n\nIf the Company or Client does not provide written notice of material non-conformance within the specified review period, the Deliverable is deemed accepted. In cases of deficiencies, the Service Provider is required to correct the Deliverable to meet the acceptance criteria. All Deliverables and milestones must be developed in accordance with the defined specifications and are subject to review, testing, and acceptance as set forth in the relevant sections of the Agreement (such as Section 2.5 and Section 2.6). Acceptance of Deliverables, milestones, or services is a prerequisite for triggering the Warranty Period, related rights, and payment obligations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 250, "prompt_tokens": 566, "total_tokens": 816, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
