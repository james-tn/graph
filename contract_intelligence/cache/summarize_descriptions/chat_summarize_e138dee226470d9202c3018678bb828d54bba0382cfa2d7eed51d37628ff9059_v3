Such events include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, pandemics, wars, terrorism, civil unrest, labor strikes (excluding those involving the affected Party’s own employees), governmental actions, embargoes, failures of service providers, and widespread internet or power outages.\n\nThe clause establishes that, except for payment obligations, both Parties are excused from liability for failure or delay in performance caused by a Force Majeure Event. In the event of such occurrences, the affected Party must promptly notify the other Party and undertake reasonable mitigation efforts to minimize the impact. The clause provides for the suspension of contractual obligations (other than payment) during the period of impairment, with extension of timelines as necessary.\n\nIf a Force Majeure Event persists for more than sixty consecutive days, either Party has the right to terminate the affected Statement of Work (SOW), Purchase Order (PO), or the Agreement itself upon written notice, with limited liability except for obligations accrued prior to termination. The clause outlines the procedures and consequences for affected Parties, including notification, mitigation, suspension of obligations, and termination rights in the event of extended force majeure. Overall, Article XV comprehensively addresses the definition, procedures, and consequences of Force Majeure Events, ensuring clarity regarding the Parties’ rights and obligations in such circumstances.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 318, "prompt_tokens": 1274, "total_tokens": 1592, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
