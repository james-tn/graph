This clause typically excludes the Vendor’s or Service Provider’s liability for service level failures resulting from the Client’s misuse, unauthorized modifications, failure to follow instructions, or events outside the Service Provider’s control, including third-party issues, scheduled maintenance, equipment failures, and force majeure events. It also lists situations where service levels and service credits are not applicable, such as failures caused by the Company, third-party vendors, or factors beyond the Service Provider’s reasonable control.\n\nAdditionally, the Exclusions Clause may specify items excluded from Operating Expenses, such as the Landlord's income taxes, capital improvements (except for amortized cost reductions), and fines not caused by the Tenant. In the context of indemnification, the clause outlines circumstances under which the Vendor or Service Provider is not obligated to indemnify the Client or Company, including modifications by others, unauthorized combinations, compliance with the Client’s specifications, use outside the license scope, or continued use after notification of non-infringing alternatives.\n\nFurthermore, the Exclusions Clause often defines what is not considered Confidential Information. This includes information that is publicly available, lawfully known prior to disclosure, lawfully disclosed by a third party, or independently developed by the receiving party. These exclusions are typically detailed in specific sections of the agreement, such as Section 5.2, Section 5.4, and Section 8.5.\n\nOverall, the \"EXCLUSIONS CLAUSE\" serves to clarify the boundaries of liability, indemnification, service level commitments, and confidentiality within the agreement, ensuring that parties are not held responsible for failures or claims arising from circumstances beyond their control or outside the agreed scope of services.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 375, "prompt_tokens": 777, "total_tokens": 1152, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
