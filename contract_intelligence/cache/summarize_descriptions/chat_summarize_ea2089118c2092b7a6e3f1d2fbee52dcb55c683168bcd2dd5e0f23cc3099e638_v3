This clause requires that any amendment, modification, waiver, or supplementation of the Agreement—including changes to the Statement of Work or the lease—must be documented in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Email alone is not considered sufficient to constitute an amendment unless expressly acknowledged as such, and there are specific requirements for what constitutes a signed writing. While the general rule is that all changes must be in writing and signed, there may be limited exceptions for urgent Change Orders. The clause ensures that any alterations to the Agreement are formally agreed upon and properly executed to maintain clarity and enforceability.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 697, "total_tokens": 871, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
