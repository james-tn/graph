These rights typically arise in the following situations:\n\n1. **Force Majeure Events:** Either party may terminate the affected SOW or Agreement if a Force Majeure Event materially affects performance and continues beyond a specified period, which may range from thirty (30), forty-five (45), sixty (60), or up to 180 consecutive days, depending on the contract. Termination may require prior written notice, typically thirty (30) days, and may be exercised without penalty.\n\n2. **Material Breach and Service Level Failures:** The Client, Contoso, or the Company may terminate the Agreement or affected SOW in the event of a material breach by the Vendor, uncured material breaches, or persistent and severe failures to meet agreed service levels or uptime commitments. These rights are often referenced in specific contract articles (e.g., Article IV) and may require written notice and an opportunity to cure.\n\n3. **Chronic SLA Failures and Uptime Commitments:** The Client or Contoso may terminate the affected SOW or services without penalty and receive a pro rata refund if there are repeated failures to meet uptime or response time commitments, such as failing in three or more months within a rolling six- or twelve-month period, or as described in a Chronic SLA Failures Clause.\n\n4. **Non-Conforming Deliverables:** Contoso or the Company may terminate the applicable SOW or services if deliverables repeatedly fail to conform to specifications, including after correction attempts or resubmissions, upon written notice and without penalty.\n\n5. **Infringement Issues:** The Vendor has the right to terminate the affected SOW if infringement issues cannot be remedied in a commercially reasonable manner.\n\nIn summary, \"TERMINATION RIGHT\" encompasses the ability of either party to end the Agreement, SOW, or specific services under conditions such as prolonged force majeure, uncured material breaches, chronic service level failures, repeated non-conformance of deliverables, or unresolved infringement, often with requirements for prior written notice and, in some cases, entitlement to refunds or termination without penalty.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 475, "prompt_tokens": 732, "total_tokens": 1207, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
