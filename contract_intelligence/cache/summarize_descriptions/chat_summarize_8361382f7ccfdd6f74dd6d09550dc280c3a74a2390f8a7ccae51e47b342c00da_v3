These conditions include the requirement for the Company to provide written notice to terminate an affected Statement of Work (SOW) and receive a pro rata refund. Clients must notify Vendors in writing of any material non-conformity to trigger remedies during the Warranty Period. Any changes to notice details or assignments must be communicated by written notice in accordance with the Notices Clause, and assignment by Contoso is valid only upon written notice to Summit Tech.\n\nIn the event of a Force Majeure, the affected party must promptly provide written notice of the event and its expected duration to the other party. Written notice is also required to trigger termination or suspension rights, and any termination for convenience or cause must be communicated via written notice specifying the reason, effective date, and, in the case of breach, a cure period, all within specified timeframes. Dispute actions and invoice disputes must also be preceded by written notice detailing the nature of the dispute.\n\nFor indemnification claims, the indemnified party must promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of any claim for which indemnification is sought. Written notice is required in various other circumstances, such as changes to insurance and notice addresses, as specified in the Notice Clause. Overall, \"CONDITION OF WRITTEN NOTICE\" ensures that termination, disputes, assignments, indemnification claims, and other significant contractual actions are formally communicated in writing within the timeframes and procedures outlined in the agreement, thereby providing clarity and legal enforceability for all parties involved.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 332, "prompt_tokens": 569, "total_tokens": 901, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
