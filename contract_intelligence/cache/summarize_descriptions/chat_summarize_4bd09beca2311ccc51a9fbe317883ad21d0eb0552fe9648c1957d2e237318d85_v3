These circumstances commonly include material breach of contract, insolvency, or other specified financial events. Termination may be immediate or subject to notice and cure periods, depending on the severity and nature of the breach or event. In some cases, termination can occur upon written notice if the other party engages in unethical or illegal conduct. Additionally, either party may terminate the Agreement or SOW(s) if performance is substantially prevented by a Force Majeure Event, typically with thirty days’ prior written notice. In lease agreements, the Landlord may have the right to terminate the Lease and recover possession upon the Tenant’s default, subject to applicable law. Overall, the \"RIGHT TO TERMINATE FOR CAUSE\" ensures that both parties have a mechanism to exit the contractual relationship in the event of serious breaches, insolvency, or other significant issues, with procedures that may include immediate termination or allow for cure periods and written notice.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 226, "prompt_tokens": 568, "total_tokens": 794, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
