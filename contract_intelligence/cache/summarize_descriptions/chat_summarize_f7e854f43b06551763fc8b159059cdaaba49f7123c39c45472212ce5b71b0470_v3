This clause also recognizes electronic signatures—including those executed via facsimile, PDF, DocuSign, or similar electronic platforms—as having the same legal effect, validity, and binding nature as handwritten signatures. Specific references such as Article XVI, Section 16.10, Section 16.11, and Clause 16.13 confirm that the agreement may be signed in counterparts and that electronic signatures are treated as originals for all purposes, making the execution of the agreement valid, effective, and enforceable. This provision facilitates flexible and efficient contract execution by permitting parties to sign separately and by electronic means, ensuring that all such signatures are legally recognized and fully effective.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 181, "prompt_tokens": 860, "total_tokens": 1041, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
