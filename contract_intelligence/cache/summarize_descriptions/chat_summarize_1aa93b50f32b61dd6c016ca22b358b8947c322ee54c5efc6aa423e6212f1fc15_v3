This clause typically includes exceptions for cases involving fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence, and death or personal injury caused by negligence. It also covers liabilities that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable law. Additionally, the clause specifies exceptions for indemnification obligations, breaches of confidentiality or data protection (including personal data breaches), breaches of license restrictions, intellectual property infringement, and payment obligations such as amounts due for fees or expenses. Clause 9.3 or Section 9.3 of the agreement often details these exceptions, clarifying that liability for fraud, death or personal injury, and other non-excludable matters is not limited by the agreement. Overall, the \"EXCEPTIONS CLAUSE\" ensures that certain critical liabilities remain fully enforceable despite any general limitations or caps on liability set forth elsewhere in the contract.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 191, "prompt_tokens": 363, "total_tokens": 554, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
