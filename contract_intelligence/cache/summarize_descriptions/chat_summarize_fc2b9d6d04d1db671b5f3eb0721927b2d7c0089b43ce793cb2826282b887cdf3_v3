The Agreement specifies the types of Deliverables to be produced and delivered, often as described in Statements of Work (SOWs), and outlines the associated obligations, warranties, and remedies.\n\nDeliverables are a key term within the Agreement, forming part of the Vendor’s or Service Provider’s obligations and the Client’s or Company’s rights.
