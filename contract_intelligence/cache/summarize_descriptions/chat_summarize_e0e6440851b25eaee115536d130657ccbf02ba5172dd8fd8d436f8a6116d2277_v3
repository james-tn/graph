This clause obligates the Service Provider or Vendor (e.g., Acme, Nova, Vanguard, Gamma) to provide certificates of insurance to the Client (e.g., Contoso, Contoso Enterprises, the Company) upon request or written request. The certificates must evidence the required insurance coverage and, in certain cases, name the Client (such as Contoso or Contoso Enterprises) as an additional insured under specified policies.\n\nAdditionally, the clause requires the Service Provider or Vendor to notify the Client promptly of any cancellation, non-renewal, material reduction, material change, or adverse modification in the insurance coverage. These notice requirements may be specified in particular sections of the contract, such as Clause 10.2 or Section 10.2, and may also apply upon renewal or any material changes to the coverage. The overall intent of the \"CERTIFICATES OF INSURANCE CLAUSE\" is to ensure that the Client is kept informed and protected regarding the insurance status of the Service Provider or Vendor throughout the term of the agreement.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 267, "prompt_tokens": 626, "total_tokens": 893, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
