Each party, such as Nova, Acme, Summit Tech, Phoenix, Contoso, Vanguard, Vendor, and Service Provider, is required to ensure that persons authorized to process Personal Data are bound by appropriate confidentiality obligations, which may be statutory or contractually mandated. These obligations extend to subcontractors and require that confidentiality and data protection standards are no less protective than those set forth in the relevant agreements or Statements of Work.\n\nThe confidentiality obligation is referenced in various contractual clauses, including limitation of liability (where it is often excluded from certain limitations), indemnification triggers (where breaches may result in indemnification), and survival clauses (where the obligation persists beyond expiration or termination of the agreement or lease). Breaches of confidentiality may result in remedies such as injunctive relief.\n\nSpecific requirements include maintaining the confidentiality and security of retained Personal Data, especially data stored in backup systems, and ensuring that audits and related information are subject to reasonable confidentiality requirements to protect the operations and information of the parties involved. The obligation also requires each party to protect and not disclose Confidential Information received from the other party, as referenced in specific sections of the agreement (e.g., Section 5.1 and Article V).\n\nOverall, the \"CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATION\" is a fundamental and enduring requirement for all parties and their representatives to safeguard confidential information and Personal Data, comply with data protection standards, and ensure that these obligations survive the termination of the agreement and apply to all relevant personnel and subcontractors.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 343, "prompt_tokens": 707, "total_tokens": 1050, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
