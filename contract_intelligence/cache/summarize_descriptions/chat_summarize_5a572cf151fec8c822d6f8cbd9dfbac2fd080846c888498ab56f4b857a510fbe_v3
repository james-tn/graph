This risk encompasses scenarios where a party, such as Contoso, Acme, or a Service Provider, may improperly disclose or use Nova’s or the Company’s Confidential Information, either directly or through third parties or representatives. It also includes the possibility that residual knowledge, archival copies, or residuals retained by a party could result in unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information or Personal Data. Such breaches may lead to legal and equitable remedies, and are considered exceptions to the liability cap due to the potential for irreparable harm. The Agreement’s Confidentiality Clause is specifically designed to mitigate these risks by imposing strict obligations on the Receiving Party and all involved entities to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 192, "prompt_tokens": 430, "total_tokens": 622, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
