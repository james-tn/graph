These expenses typically include travel and living costs and must be documented and comply with the Client’s or Company’s travel and expense policies. The clause may specify approval thresholds, require prior approval for certain expenses, and sometimes set caps (e.g., a $2,500 limit per trip/event for Gamma without prior approval). Reimbursement is contingent upon the Vendor providing appropriate documentation and, where applicable, adhering to the Client’s or Company’s pre-approval requirements and expense policies. The clause may be referenced in specific contract sections, such as Clause 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, or 3.9, and can address pass-through costs. Overall, the clause ensures that Vendors or Service Providers are compensated for reasonable, necessary, and approved expenses incurred while delivering services, subject to the Client’s or Company’s policies and documentation requirements.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 254, "prompt_tokens": 631, "total_tokens": 885, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
