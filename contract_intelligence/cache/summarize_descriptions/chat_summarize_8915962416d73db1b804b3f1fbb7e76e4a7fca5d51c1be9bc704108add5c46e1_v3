This refund is provided to the entitled party—such as the Company or Client—under specific circumstances, including termination of a Statement of Work (SOW) or Service due to infringement issues, chronic failure, non-conformity that cannot be corrected, or objection to a new Subprocessor. In each case, the refund is calculated based on the unused portion of the Term for the affected Services, ensuring that only the fees corresponding to the unutilized period are returned. For example, Contoso is entitled to a pro rata refund from Acme if Acme cannot correct a non-conformity or if Contoso terminates due to objection to a new Subprocessor.
