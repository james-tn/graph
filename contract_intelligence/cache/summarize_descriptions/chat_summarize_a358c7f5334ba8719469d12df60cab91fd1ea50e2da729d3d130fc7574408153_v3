It outlines the invoicing schedules, including monthly and milestone-based invoicing, and specifies the level of detail required in invoices to ensure clarity and sufficiency. The clause establishes payment deadlines, most commonly requiring that all undisputed, properly invoiced amounts be paid within thirty (30), forty-five (45), or sixty (60) days from the date of invoice or receipt (Net 30, Net 45, or Net 60), depending on the specific terms agreed by the parties. For example, Contoso and other clients are typically required to pay undisputed invoices within thirty (30) or sixty (60) days, with some exceptions such as Base Rent, which may be due in advance.\n\nAccepted payment methods include U.S. Dollars via electronic funds transfer, wire transfer, ACH, or other mutually agreed methods, and the responsibility for any bank or transaction charges is generally assigned to the payer. The clause also addresses procedures for disputing invoices and specifies that only undisputed amounts are subject to the stated payment timelines. Overall, the \"PAYMENT TERMS CLAUSE\" ensures clear expectations regarding payment schedules, methods, and responsibilities, promoting timely and accurate financial transactions between parties.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 268, "prompt_tokens": 697, "total_tokens": 965, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
