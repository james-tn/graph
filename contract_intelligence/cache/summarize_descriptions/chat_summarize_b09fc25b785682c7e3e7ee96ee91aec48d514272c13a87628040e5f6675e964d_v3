These obligations typically arise from claims related to use, occupancy, acts or omissions, breaches of agreement, violations of legal requirements, intellectual property infringement, and data protection breaches, and are subject to exclusions and conditions such as exceptions for gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\nThe indemnification duties are often detailed in specific sections of agreements (e.g., Article VIII or the Indemnification Clause) and may survive termination of the agreement. The obligations may be interpreted broadly to favor certain parties (such as Nova Systems LLC), sometimes including uncapped liability and enhanced protections regarding indemnity and intellectual property rights. Each party is generally required to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party and its affiliates or indemnitees to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, following specified procedures and conditions. In summary, the \"OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY\" establishes a comprehensive framework for risk allocation and protection among contracting parties, ensuring coverage for a wide range of third-party claims and related damages.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 299, "prompt_tokens": 930, "total_tokens": 1229, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
