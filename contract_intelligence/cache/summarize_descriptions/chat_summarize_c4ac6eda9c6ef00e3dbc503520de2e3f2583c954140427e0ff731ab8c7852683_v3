This clause generally permits these entities to subcontract portions of the services to qualified third parties, provided several key conditions are met:\n\n1. **Responsibility and Liability:** The primary entity (e.g., Summit Tech, Acme, Vendor, Service Provider, Vanguard) remains fully responsible and liable for the performance of the subcontracted services and the acts or omissions of its subcontractors.\n\n2. **Confidentiality and Data Protection:** Subcontractors must be bound by confidentiality and data protection obligations that are consistent with those in the main agreement, ensuring the protection of sensitive information.\n\n3. **Consent for Material Portions:** For material or significant portions of the services, prior written consent from the client or company (e.g., Contoso) is required before subcontracting. This restriction ensures that the client maintains oversight and control over critical aspects of the service delivery.\n\n4. **Identification and Notification:** The Service Provider may be required to identify subcontractors upon request, providing transparency to the client regarding who is involved in service delivery.\n\n5. **Written Obligations:** Subcontractors must be bound by written obligations that are consistent with the terms of the main contract, ensuring alignment and enforceability.\n\nSpecific references to clause numbers (such as Section 16.7, Clause 16.11, and Clause 2.7) indicate where these provisions may be found in various agreements. Overall, the \"SUBCONTRACTING CLAUSE\" balances the flexibility for service providers to engage third parties with safeguards that protect the interests of the client, including responsibility, confidentiality, and the requirement for consent for significant subcontracting arrangements.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 365, "prompt_tokens": 442, "total_tokens": 807, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
