Clause 14.3 states that unresolved disputes are to be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales. Clause 14.4 specifies that legal actions or proceedings must be brought exclusively in state or federal courts located in California, specifically Santa Clara or San Francisco County, and that the parties submit to the jurisdiction and venue of those courts. Clause 16.2 requires that legal actions be brought in the state or federal courts of San Francisco County, California, with parties submitting to the jurisdiction of those courts. Clause 16.10, however, specifies that legal actions or proceedings related to the agreement must be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in King County, Washington.\n\nThese clauses present conflicting requirements regarding the exclusive venue and jurisdiction for legal actions, naming courts in England and Wales, California (Santa Clara and San Francisco County), and King County, Washington. To resolve these contradictions, the agreement should clarify which clause takes precedence or specify the circumstances under which each venue applies. As currently described, the \"VENUE AND JURISDICTION CLAUSE\" contains multiple, mutually exclusive provisions regarding the location and jurisdiction for legal proceedings, and parties should seek clarification to ensure compliance with the intended venue and jurisdiction requirements.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 289, "prompt_tokens": 277, "total_tokens": 566, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
