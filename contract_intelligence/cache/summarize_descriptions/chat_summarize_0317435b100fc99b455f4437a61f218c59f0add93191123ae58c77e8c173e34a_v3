It generally refers to any day on which business is conducted, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and days when banks or commercial institutions in a specified jurisdiction (such as Delaware, California, Washington, New York, Texas, England, or Singapore) are authorized or required by law to be closed, including public or legal holidays.\n\nWithin the context of agreements, \"BUSINESS DAY\" serves as the standard unit of time for calculating review periods, acceptance timelines, payment schedules, cure periods, notice requirements, and response and resolution times for incidents, disputes, and support or maintenance obligations. It is used to define timeframes for actions such as dispute notification, negotiation, escalation, mediation, arbitration, and delivery or receipt of notices, including those sent by mail or courier. The term is also referenced in Service Level Agreements (SLA) to set response times for support requests, restoration, and remediation targets, and to specify advance notification periods for scheduled maintenance.\n\n\"BUSINESS DAY\" is crucial for determining the effective date of communications, measuring deadlines for invoice disputes and payments, and establishing periods for review and acceptance of deliverables. The definition may vary slightly depending on the jurisdiction specified in the agreement, but it consistently excludes weekends and recognized holidays. In some agreements, it is further defined by local banking holidays, such as those in Delaware, California, Washington, New York, Texas, England, or Singapore.\n\nIn summary, \"BUSINESS DAY\" is a key contractual term representing a standard working day, used to measure and define timeframes for all time-sensitive actions, obligations, and rights under an agreement, typically excluding weekends and public or bank holidays in the relevant jurisdiction.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 369, "prompt_tokens": 2437, "total_tokens": 2806, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
