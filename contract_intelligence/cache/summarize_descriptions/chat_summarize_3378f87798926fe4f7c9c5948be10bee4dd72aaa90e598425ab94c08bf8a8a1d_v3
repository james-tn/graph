This includes modifications, enhancements, derivative works, and any other items arising out of or relating to the services, but specifically excludes the service provider’s pre-existing intellectual property (such as Vendor Pre-Existing Materials, Acme Background IP, or Vanguard’s Pre-Existing IP), third-party materials, and client-provided materials.\n\n\"WORK PRODUCT\" may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, indemnification, warranty, and insurance coverage provisions as defined in the Agreement. Ownership of the Work Product is typically transferred to the client (such as Contoso) upon full payment, and may be treated as a \"work made for hire\" or assigned, except where expressly stated otherwise in the SOW. In some cases, underlying ownership may be retained by the service provider unless otherwise agreed. The Work Product must conform to agreed specifications and may survive termination of the Agreement if fully paid for. It is also subject to non-infringement obligations and may exclude approved open source components.\n\nIn summary, \"WORK PRODUCT\" encompasses all deliverables and related outputs created by the service provider for the client under the Agreement, with specific exclusions and subject to defined ownership, licensing, warranty, and indemnification terms.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 335, "prompt_tokens": 979, "total_tokens": 1314, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
