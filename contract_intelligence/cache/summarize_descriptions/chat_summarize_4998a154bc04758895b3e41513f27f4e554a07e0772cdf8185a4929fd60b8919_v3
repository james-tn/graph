This clause consistently states that the agreement is intended solely for the benefit of the Parties involved and their permitted successors and assigns. It explicitly excludes the creation of rights, benefits, or remedies for any third party, ensuring that no external entity can claim entitlement under the agreement. However, there is a specific exception: as expressly provided in Article VIII, certain indemnified parties or Indemnitees (and, in some cases, their Affiliates) may be granted rights or benefits under the agreement. This exception is referenced in multiple sections and clauses, including Article XVI, Section 16.7, Clause 16.9, Clause 16.10, and Clause 16.12, all of which reiterate that, except as set forth in Article VIII regarding indemnified parties, the agreement does not confer any rights or benefits on third parties. In summary, the \"NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES CLAUSE\" ensures that only the Parties to the agreement and their permitted successors and assigns are beneficiaries, with the sole exception of indemnified parties as expressly provided in Article VIII.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 250, "prompt_tokens": 696, "total_tokens": 946, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
