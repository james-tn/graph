These obligations require each party and any persons authorized to process personal data to commit to confidentiality regarding such data. Specifically, the Receiving Party must use Confidential Information only as necessary for the purposes of the Agreement, not disclose it to third parties except as permitted, and protect it with reasonable care. Parties are also required to ensure that any third parties to whom Confidential Information is disclosed are bound by similar confidentiality obligations. Breach of these confidentiality obligations, as set forth in Article V (including Section 5.2), is treated as an exception to the limitation of liability provisions, such as those in Section 9.2, meaning that liability for breaches of confidentiality is not subject to the usual liability caps. Overall, \"CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS\" encompass the requirement for all parties to use, protect, and not disclose Confidential Information except as permitted by the Agreement, with special provisions for personal data and exceptions to standard liability limitations.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 231, "prompt_tokens": 510, "total_tokens": 741, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
