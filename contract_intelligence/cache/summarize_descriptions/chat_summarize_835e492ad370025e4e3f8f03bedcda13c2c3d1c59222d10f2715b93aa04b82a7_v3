This condition commonly applies to the assignment or transfer of the agreement, meaning that a party cannot assign or transfer its rights or obligations under the agreement without obtaining the other party’s prior written consent, except in situations explicitly provided for in the agreement. Additionally, within the Indemnification Procedures Clause, this condition requires that the Indemnifying Party may not settle any claim in a way that imposes liability or an admission of fault on the Indemnified Party without first obtaining the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent.
