This right applies under specified circumstances, typically outlined in the Lease or indemnification clauses, and covers certain claims and losses, particularly those arising from third-party claims. The indemnification ensures that the Indemnified Party (and its affiliates and indemnitees) receives protection from the Indemnifying Party against such claims, including legal defense and compensation for losses.
