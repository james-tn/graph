Typically, these negotiations begin between project managers or relevant representatives. If the dispute remains unresolved, the clause mandates escalation to senior executives or senior management for further attempts at resolution. Only after these steps have been exhausted may the Parties proceed to formal dispute resolution methods such as mediation, arbitration, or litigation. This clause is generally included as a sub-clause of the broader Dispute Resolution Clause and emphasizes good faith efforts to resolve disputes informally and at progressively higher levels of authority before seeking external remedies.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 357, "total_tokens": 518, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
