Generally, the clause restricts the use of Contoso’s name, logo, or trademarks in marketing materials, advertising, press releases, public announcements, and client lists without Contoso’s prior written consent. Exceptions are sometimes made for the inclusion of Contoso’s name and logo in confidential customer lists or non-public marketing materials, provided such use complies with Contoso’s branding or trademark guidelines and does not disclose confidential information or engagement details.\n\nFor example, Atlas and Vanguard may identify Contoso as a customer in marketing materials and on their websites, subject to Contoso’s branding guidelines and reasonable restrictions, but other public announcements require Contoso’s prior written consent. Acme is generally restricted from using Contoso’s name, logo, or trademarks in publicity or marketing materials without prior written consent, except for identifying Contoso as a customer in customer lists unless Contoso objects. Phoenix Industries is prohibited from issuing press releases or public announcements about the agreement or using Contoso’s name or logo for promotional purposes without Contoso’s prior written consent, which may be withheld at Contoso’s sole discretion.\n\nThe clause also typically requires mutual consent for press releases or public announcements regarding the relationship or statement of work. In some cases, Contoso is permitted to include the service provider or vendor in internal communications and procurement records without consent. Additionally, joint marketing activities may be allowed by separate agreement.\n\nOverall, the \"PUBLICITY CLAUSE\" ensures that Contoso retains control over how its name, logo, and trademarks are used in external communications, with limited exceptions for customer identification in non-public or confidential materials, and always subject to Contoso’s guidelines and consent requirements.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 381, "prompt_tokens": 797, "total_tokens": 1178, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
