This clause requires the Service Provider to give advance notice to the Client (also referred to as Contoso), typically at least five business days prior to the maintenance window, except in cases of emergency. Maintenance windows are subject to restrictions on timing and duration, with efforts made to schedule maintenance outside normal business hours and to minimize business disruption. The aggregate duration of scheduled maintenance is limited, commonly not exceeding eight hours per calendar month, and such maintenance does not count as downtime for the purposes of availability or uptime commitments. The clause also specifies that significant downtime requires additional advance notice, and all scheduled maintenance must be performed within agreed windows, with requirements for off-peak scheduling and written notification. Overall, the clause is designed to balance the Service Provider’s need to maintain and upgrade services with the Client’s need for service continuity and minimal disruption.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 211, "prompt_tokens": 483, "total_tokens": 694, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
