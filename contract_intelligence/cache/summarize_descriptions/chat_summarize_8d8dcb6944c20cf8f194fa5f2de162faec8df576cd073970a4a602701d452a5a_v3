This clause specifies a multi-step process that typically begins with informal or good faith negotiations between the parties. If the dispute is not resolved, the process escalates to senior executives or senior representatives for further negotiation.\n\nShould escalation fail to resolve the dispute, the clause requires mediation as a next step, and in some cases, provides for optional or non-mandatory binding arbitration. Litigation is available as a final recourse, with the clause detailing procedures for venue, jurisdiction, and the allocation or entitlement of attorneys’ fees. The clause also allows for interim or injunctive relief, particularly to protect Confidential Information or Intellectual Property Rights.\n\nThroughout the dispute resolution process, the clause may specify that the parties must continue to perform their obligations under the Agreement. It is referenced in the survival provision, meaning it remains in effect even after the termination or expiration of the Agreement. Overall, the \"DISPUTE RESOLUTION CLAUSE\" in Article XIV provides a structured, escalating framework for resolving disputes, emphasizing negotiation, mediation, and, if necessary, arbitration or litigation, while ensuring the protection of key interests and the continuity of contractual performance.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 266, "prompt_tokens": 734, "total_tokens": 1000, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
