Each SOW specifies the detailed scope, deliverables, and requirements for particular services, projects, or engagements to be performed under the Agreement. It describes in detail the specific Services and Deliverables to be provided, including project phases, milestones, timelines, schedules, acceptance criteria, responsibilities, assumptions, and associated fees or payment terms. The SOW may also include specifications, performance metrics, service levels, personnel requirements, and other project-specific or engagement-specific terms and conditions.\n\nEach SOW is mutually executed by authorized representatives of the Parties and may be attached as a schedule, incorporated by reference, or issued as a work order or similar document. SOWs can be amended, renewed, or terminated independently, and are subject to the terms and governance of the overarching Agreement. They may also include exhibits, attachments, or additional details for optional or professional services, and are subject to amendment by Change Order if necessary.
