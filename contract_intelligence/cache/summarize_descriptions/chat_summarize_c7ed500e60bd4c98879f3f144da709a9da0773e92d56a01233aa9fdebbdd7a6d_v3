This clause unequivocally disclaims all warranties except those expressly provided in the Agreement, Article VII, or a signed Statement of Work (SOW). It covers both express and implied warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, satisfactory quality, and non-infringement, as well as warranties arising from course of dealing. The clause states that, except as expressly set forth, neither party makes any other representations or warranties, and all implied warranties are disclaimed. In some instances, it clarifies that all software, services, and deliverables are provided \"as is,\" and the Vendor (or Atlas, as referenced) disclaims all other warranties. The clause also notes that Acme's indemnity obligations and express warranties are not limited by this disclaimer. Overall, the \"DISCLAIMER CLAUSE\" serves to limit the parties' liability by ensuring that only those warranties explicitly stated in the Agreement or signed SOWs are recognized, and all other warranties, whether express or implied, are excluded.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 243, "prompt_tokens": 994, "total_tokens": 1237, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
