It specifies the courts in which legal actions or proceedings related to the Agreement must be brought and to whose jurisdiction the Parties submit. While the clause may designate different exclusive jurisdictions—such as the state or federal courts located in New York County, New York; Delaware; or King County, Washington—it generally requires that Parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the specified courts and waive any objections to venue. The precise jurisdiction named in the \"JURISDICTION CLAUSE\" should be determined by the specific Agreement, but its core function is to clearly define the legal forum for resolving disputes and recognizing intellectual property rights under the Agreement.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 169, "prompt_tokens": 255, "total_tokens": 424, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
