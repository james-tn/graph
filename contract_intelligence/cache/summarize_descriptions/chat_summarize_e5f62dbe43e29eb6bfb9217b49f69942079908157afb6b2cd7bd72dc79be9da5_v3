The duration of the cure period varies depending on the nature of the breach or default:\n\n- For late payments or payment defaults, the cure period is typically fifteen (15) days.\n- For material breaches or other non-monetary defaults, the period is generally thirty (30) days, but may be extended up to sixty (60) or even ninety (90) days for more complex non-monetary obligations, or if additional time is reasonably granted or agreed upon by the parties.\n- In cases involving bankruptcy dismissal, a cure period of sixty (60) days may apply.\n\nThe cure period serves as a protective mechanism, allowing the breaching party an opportunity to correct the breach or default before the non-breaching party may exercise rights such as termination of the agreement, suspension of services, or other remedies for cause. In landlord-tenant relationships, the cure period allows the tenant or landlord to remedy a default after receiving notice, with similar timeframes (typically thirty days, extendable up to ninety days for non-monetary obligations).\n\nOverall, the \"CURE PERIOD\" ensures fairness by providing a specified window for remediation before more severe contractual consequences are enforced.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "protected_material_code": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 292, "prompt_tokens": 723, "total_tokens": 1015, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}}
