The duration of the REVIEW PERIOD varies depending on the agreement or Statement of Work, but is most commonly specified as ten (10) or fifteen (15) Business Days. In some cases, a thirty (30) day period may apply, particularly for Contoso. If the Client or Company identifies issues, subsequent five (5) day periods may be allotted for the review of corrected deliverables. The REVIEW PERIOD is intended to ensure that deliverables are assessed for material conformity with requirements and acceptance criteria, and that timely feedback is provided.
