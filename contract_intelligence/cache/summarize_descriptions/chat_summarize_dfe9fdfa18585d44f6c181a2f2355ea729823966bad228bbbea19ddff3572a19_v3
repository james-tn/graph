Service Levels are detailed in Article XII of the Agreement and in applicable Statements of Work (SOWs). They encompass performance metrics, standards, and commitments, including specific requirements for service quality, availability, and uptime. These standards apply to the Services, including those provided by Nova, and set measurable benchmarks that the Vendor must meet. The Agreement also preserves the Client’s rights regarding Service Levels even after the acceptance of deliverables, emphasizing their ongoing importance.
