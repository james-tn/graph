-Goal-
Given a contract document, identify all entities of the types specified below and all relationships between them.

-Entity Types-
Contract, Party, Clause, Obligation, Right, Term, Condition, Jurisdiction, MonetaryValue, Risk

-Relationship Types-
IS_PARTY_TO, CONTAINS_CLAUSE, IMPOSES_OBLIGATION, GRANTS_RIGHT, DEFINES_TERM, CONDITIONAL_ON, AMENDS, LOCATED_IN, HAS_VALUE, MITIGATES_RISK, GOVERNED_BY, SIGNED_BY

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following: Contract, Party, Clause, Obligation, Right, Term, Condition, Jurisdiction, MonetaryValue, Risk
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity" | "entity_name" | "entity_type" | "entity_description")

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all relationships. For each relationship, extract the following information:
- source_entity: Name of the source entity
- target_entity: Name of the target entity
- relationship_description: Explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating the strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship" | "source_entity" | "target_entity" | "relationship_description" | "relationship_strength")

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When describing the content of a relationship, summarize the specific nature of the link. For example, if a Contract contains a Clause, describe what that clause is about in the relationship description.

-Examples-
Example 1:
Entity_types: [Party, Contract, Clause]
Text:
This Master Services Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between Acme Corp ("Customer") and Beta Ltd ("Provider"). The Provider shall indemnify the Customer against all claims.
Output:
("entity" | "Master Services Agreement" | "Contract" | "The primary agreement between Acme Corp and Beta Ltd.")
{record_delimiter}
("entity" | "Acme Corp" | "Party" | "The Customer in the agreement.")
{record_delimiter}
("entity" | "Beta Ltd" | "Party" | "The Provider in the agreement.")
{record_delimiter}
("entity" | "Indemnification Clause" | "Clause" | "A clause requiring Provider to indemnify Customer.")
{record_delimiter}
("relationship" | "Acme Corp" | "Master Services Agreement" | "Acme Corp is a party to the Master Services Agreement" | 10)
{record_delimiter}
("relationship" | "Beta Ltd" | "Master Services Agreement" | "Beta Ltd is a party to the Master Services Agreement" | 10)
{record_delimiter}
("relationship" | "Master Services Agreement" | "Indemnification Clause" | "The Agreement contains an indemnification clause" | 8)
{record_delimiter}
("relationship" | "Beta Ltd" | "Indemnification Clause" | "Beta Ltd is responsible for the indemnification obligation" | 9)
