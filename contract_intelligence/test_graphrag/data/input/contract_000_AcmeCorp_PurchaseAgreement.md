## SCOPE OF SERVICES AND WORK

2.1 **General Description.** During the Term, Acme shall provide to Contoso the Products, Services, and Deliverables described in this Agreement and in one or more SOWs or POs executed pursuant hereto. The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement is intended to establish a master framework, and that specific scopes of work shall be defined in individual SOWs or POs referencing this Agreement.

2.2 **Products.** Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Acme shall sell and deliver to Contoso the Products identified in applicable POs, which may include, without limitation: (a) network appliances and related hardware components; (b) perpetual or subscription-based software licenses; and (c) associated accessories and replacement parts. Each PO will specify the Product description, quantity, unit price, shipment terms, and delivery location.

2.3 **Services.** Acme shall perform the Services as described in the applicable SOW(s), which may include the following categories:

   2.3.1 **Implementation and Integration Services.** Acme shall configure and implement the Products in Contoso’s designated environment, including:  
   (a) assessment of Contoso’s existing infrastructure;  
   (b) design of integration architecture;  
   (c) installation and configuration of Products;  
   (d) integration with applicable Contoso systems, applications, and third-party platforms (to the extent specified in the SOW); and  
   (e) system and integration testing.

   2.3.2 **Customization and Development.** Where specified in an SOW, Acme shall design, develop, and test custom configurations, scripts, or modules to meet Contoso’s business requirements. Acme shall ensure that all customizations conform to industry best practices, are compatible with the core Products, and are documented sufficiently to enable maintenance and support.

   2.3.3 **Training.** Acme shall provide training to Contoso’s designated personnel on the use, administration, and basic troubleshooting of the Products and any Deliverables. Training may include on-site, remote, and/or recorded sessions as specified in the applicable SOW, and shall include training materials in electronic form.

   2.3.4 **Support and Maintenance.** Acme shall provide support and maintenance for the Products and Deliverables in accordance with Article XII (Service Level Agreements) and any applicable support schedule. Such support shall include helpdesk services, incident management, bug fixes, updates, and upgrades, subject to any specific terms in the SOW.

2.4 **Deliverables; Milestones.** Each SOW shall identify the Deliverables, along with associated acceptance criteria, milestones, and delivery dates. By way of illustration (and not limitation), Deliverables may include:  
(a) a detailed solution design document;  
(b) configuration documentation;  
(c) test plans and test results;  
(d) training guides and user manuals; and  
(e) final deployment readiness and “go-live” reports.

   2.4.1 **Delivery and Acceptance.** Unless otherwise stated in an SOW, Contoso shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of a Deliverable to review and either: (a) accept the Deliverable in writing; or (b) reject the Deliverable by providing a written notice of non-conformity that describes in reasonable detail the deficiencies with reference to the applicable acceptance criteria. If Contoso timely rejects a Deliverable, Acme shall, at no additional cost to Contoso, promptly correct the deficiencies and resubmit the Deliverable for re-testing and re-acceptance within a commercially reasonable period agreed by the Parties.

   2.4.2 If Contoso neither accepts nor rejects a Deliverable within the applicable review period, the Deliverable shall not be deemed accepted by silence; instead, Acme may provide written notice requesting a decision, and if Contoso does not respond within fifteen (15) days of such notice, the Deliverable may, upon mutual written agreement, be deemed accepted. The Parties expressly acknowledge that the intent is to ensure active acceptance rather than passive deemed acceptance, in line with the low-risk, client-favorable allocation.

2.5 **Performance Standards.** Acme shall perform all Services:  
(a) in a professional and workmanlike manner, using personnel with appropriate skill, experience, and qualifications;  
(b) in accordance with industry best practices and the standards typically observed by reputable providers of similar services;  
(c) in compliance with all applicable Laws and with Contoso’s written policies and security requirements provided to Acme in advance; and  
(d) so as not to unreasonably interfere with Contoso’s business operations.

2.6 **Project Management and Governance.**

   2.6.1 **Project Managers.** Each Party shall appoint a project manager who shall be responsible for day-to-day coordination, approvals, and communication regarding the Services. The project managers shall meet (in person or by teleconference) at least monthly, or as otherwise reasonably requested by either Party, to review project status, milestones, and issues.

   2.6.2 **Status Reporting.** Acme shall provide regular written status reports at least monthly during the performance of any SOW, summarizing progress against milestones, issues, risk assessments, and any proposed mitigation plans. Contoso may reasonably request more frequent reporting during critical phases (e.g., pre go-live).

   2.6.3 **Change Management.** Changes to scope, schedule, or Fees shall be handled in accordance with Article XIII (Change Management). No change shall be effective unless documented in a Change Order executed by both Parties.

2.7 **Contoso Responsibilities.** Contoso shall:  
(a) provide Acme with timely access to relevant personnel, systems, and information reasonably necessary for Acme to perform the Services;  
(b) designate a primary contact and subject matter experts for the project;  
(c) fulfill any assumptions or dependencies identified in the SOW; and  
(d) review and provide feedback on Deliverables within the timeframes specified herein. Acme shall not be liable for delays or failures to meet milestones to the extent directly caused by Contoso’s failure to fulfill such responsibilities, provided that Acme has given prompt written notice of such failure and its impact.

2.8 **Subcontractors.** Acme may use subcontractors in the performance of the Services only with Contoso’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). Acme shall remain fully responsible for the acts and omissions of its subcontractors as if they were the acts and omissions of Acme, and shall ensure that all subcontractors are bound by written agreements that are at least as protective of Contoso’s rights as this Agreement.

## ARTICLE III  
## FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 **Contract Value.** The Parties acknowledge that the anticipated aggregate contract value under this Agreement, inclusive of all Products, Services, and Deliverables, is approximately Two Million One Hundred Sixty-Four Thousand Eight Hundred Four U.S. Dollars (US $2,164,804), subject to the issuance and acceptance of specific POs and SOWs. This figure is an estimate and not a commitment by Contoso to purchase any minimum volume unless expressly set forth in an applicable SOW or PO.

3.2 **Fee Schedules.** Fees for Products, Services, and Deliverables shall be set forth in one or more fee schedules attached to SOWs or referenced in POs. Such schedules may include:  
(a) fixed-fee amounts for defined Deliverables or project phases;  
(b) time-and-materials rates on an hourly or daily basis, with agreed rate cards; and  
(c) unit prices for Products and any recurring fees (e.g., annual support or subscription fees).

3.3 **Milestone-Based Payments.** Where applicable, SOWs shall specify milestone-based payment schedules. By way of example, an SOW may specify:  
- 20% of total Fees upon SOW execution;  
- 30% upon completion and acceptance of detailed design;  
- 30% upon completion and acceptance of system integration testing; and  
- 20% upon final acceptance and go-live.

In no event shall Contoso be obligated to pay for any milestone unless the corresponding Deliverables and/or Services have been completed and accepted in accordance with Section 2.4.

3.4 **Invoicing.** Acme shall issue invoices to Contoso in accordance with the applicable SOW or PO. Unless otherwise specified:  
(a) invoices for fixed-fee milestones shall be issued upon acceptance of the relevant milestone;  
(b) invoices for time-and-materials services shall be issued monthly in arrears, with detailed timesheets attached; and  
(c) invoices for Products shall be issued upon shipment or delivery, as specified in the PO.

Each invoice shall reference the applicable SOW or PO number, provide a clear description of the Products or Services provided, and include any supporting documentation reasonably requested by Contoso.

3.5 **Payment Terms.** Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Contoso shall pay undisputed amounts properly invoiced within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of the applicable invoice (**“Net 60”**). Payment shall be made in U.S. Dollars by electronic funds transfer or such other method as the Parties may agree in writing.

3.6 **Disputed Amounts.** If Contoso disputes any portion of an invoice in good faith, Contoso shall notify Acme in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of the invoice, specifying the nature and basis of the dispute. Contoso shall timely pay all undisputed amounts. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any disputed amounts promptly. No failure to timely dispute an invoice shall waive Contoso’s right to dispute charges arising from fraud, manifest error, or non-compliance with this Agreement.

3.7 **Late Payment.** Any undisputed amount not paid when due may accrue interest at a rate not to exceed one percent (1%) per month (or the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law, if lower), calculated from the date due until the date paid. Acme may not suspend performance of Services or withhold Deliverables for late payment unless: (a) such amounts are undisputed; (b) remain unpaid for at least thirty (30) days after written notice of non-payment; and (c) Acme has engaged in good faith discussions with Contoso to resolve the delinquency. Under no circumstances shall late payment penalties exceed reasonable amounts consistent with a low-risk, client-favorable arrangement.

3.8 **Expenses and Reimbursements.** Contoso shall reimburse Acme for reasonable, pre-approved, out-of-pocket travel and related expenses incurred in connection with the performance of Services, provided that:  
(a) such expenses are in accordance with Contoso’s travel and expense policies provided to Acme;  
(b) Acme obtains Contoso’s written approval (which may be by email) prior to incurring any single travel expense exceeding US $1,000; and  
(c) Acme submits original receipts or other reasonable documentation with its expense reimbursement requests. Expenses shall be invoiced separately and shall be payable under the same Net 60 terms as other Fees.

3.9 **Taxes.** All Fees are exclusive of sales, use, value-added, or other similar taxes imposed by governmental authorities, which shall be the responsibility of Contoso, excluding taxes based on Acme’s net income, property, or employment. Acme shall itemize any applicable taxes on its invoices. If Contoso provides Acme with a valid tax exemption certificate, Acme shall not collect such exempted taxes.

3.10 **Most-Favored Customer.** During the Term, Acme represents that the pricing offered to Contoso for Products and Services of comparable scope and volume is no less favorable than the pricing offered to other similarly situated customers under substantially similar circumstances. If Acme subsequently offers more favorable pricing or discounts for materially similar offerings, Acme shall extend such pricing or discounts to Contoso prospectively upon written request.

   4.5.3 Termination shall not relieve either Party of any liability or obligation that has accrued prior to the effective date of termination, including payment obligations for Fees properly due and payable, or any obligations that by their nature are intended to survive, as specified in Section 16.8.

4.6 **Transition Assistance.** Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, and upon Contoso’s written request before or within thirty (30) days after such expiration or termination, Acme shall provide reasonable transition assistance for up to ninety (90) days to facilitate a smooth migration of Services to Contoso or a third-party provider, at Acme’s then-standard time-and-materials rates (or as otherwise agreed in an SOW), subject to a mutually agreed plan.

8.4 **Infringement Remedies.** In the event of any Claim alleging infringement by the Deliverables, Products, or Services, Acme may, at its option and expense:  
(a) procure for Contoso the right to continue using the affected items;  
(b) modify or replace the affected items so that they are non-infringing while retaining substantially equivalent functionality; or  
(c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially practicable, terminate the applicable SOW or PO and refund to Contoso any prepaid Fees for unused Services or undelivered Products, plus a pro rata portion of any prepaid amounts for affected Deliverables. The foregoing, together with the indemnity obligations set forth in Section 8.1(a), shall be Contoso’s exclusive remedy for claims of intellectual property infringement, subject to the limitations in Article IX and the exceptions in Section 9.3.

8.5 **Exclusions.** Acme shall have no obligation under Section 8.1(a) to the extent that a Claim results from:  
(a) modifications to the Deliverables or Products made by anyone other than Acme or its authorized subcontractors;  
(b) combination or use of the Deliverables or Products with other products, software, or services not provided or specified by Acme, if the Claim would not have arisen but for such combination or use;  
(c) Compliance with specifications or designs provided by Contoso, if the Claim would not have arisen but for such compliance; or  
(d) use of the Deliverables or Products by Contoso after Acme has notified Contoso of, and made available, a non-infringing alternative that provides substantially equivalent functionality.

## ARTICLE IX  
## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 **Cap on Liability.** EXCEPT FOR THE EXCLUSIONS LISTED IN SECTION 9.3, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CONTOSO TO ACME UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

9.2 **Exclusion of Certain Damages.** EXCEPT FOR THE EXCLUSIONS LISTED IN SECTION 9.3, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR LOSS OF DATA), ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR IF SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE.

9.3 **Exceptions.** The limitations set forth in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 shall not apply to:  
(a) a Party’s indemnification obligations under Article VIII;  
(b) a Party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under Article V or data protection obligations under Article XI (to the extent involving unauthorized disclosure or use of Client Data or other Confidential Information);  
(c) a Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; or  
(d) amounts due and payable for Fees or expenses under this Agreement.  

The foregoing reflects a client-favorable allocation of risk in light of the low risk level of this engagement.

9.4 **Multiple Claims.** Multiple Claims shall not enlarge the limitations set forth in this Article IX. The cap in Section 9.1 is a cumulative cap, not a per-claim cap.

10.3 **Subcontractors.** Acme shall require its subcontractors that perform Services under this Agreement to maintain insurance coverage appropriate to the nature and scope of the subcontracted Services, and in no event less than coverage required by applicable Law.

## ARTICLE XI  
## DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY

11.1 **Compliance with Data Protection Laws.** Each Party shall comply with all applicable data protection and privacy Laws in connection with its performance under this Agreement, including, to the extent applicable, the CCPA, the GDPR, and any similar Laws in other jurisdictions.

11.2 **Role of the Parties.** The Parties acknowledge that, with respect to Personal Data contained in Client Data:  
(a) Contoso acts as a “business” under the CCPA and as a “controller” under the GDPR (or equivalent terms under other Laws); and  
(b) Acme acts as a “service provider” under the CCPA and a “processor” under the GDPR, solely processing such Personal Data on behalf of Contoso and in accordance with Contoso’s documented instructions and this Agreement.

11.3 **Use and Disclosure Restrictions.** Acme shall:  
(a) process Client Data, including Personal Data, only to perform the Services and provide the Products and Deliverables under this Agreement, and for no other purpose;  
(b) not “sell” or “share” (as those terms are defined under the CCPA) any Personal Data, nor retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any commercial purpose other than as permitted by this Agreement;  
(c) not combine Personal Data with personal data received from other sources, except as permitted by applicable Law and necessary to provide the Services; and  
(d) not disclose Client Data to any third party without Contoso’s prior written consent, except to subprocessors authorized under this Agreement or as required by Law.

11.4 **Security Measures.** Acme shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Client Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access, including, at a minimum:  
(a) access controls and authentication measures;  
(b) encryption of Client Data at rest and in transit, where reasonably appropriate;  
(c) regular vulnerability testing and patch management;  
(d) physical security measures for facilities where Client Data is stored or processed; and  
(e) incident response procedures.

11.5 **Data Breach Notification.** In the event of any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized access, acquisition, or disclosure of Client Data, or other personal data breach involving Client Data (a **“Data Breach”**), Acme shall:  
(a) notify Contoso promptly and in any event within seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Data Breach;  
(b) provide Contoso with reasonably detailed information about the nature of the Data Breach, the affected Client Data, and the steps taken or proposed to remediate and mitigate the Data Breach; and  
(c) cooperate with Contoso, at Acme’s expense (to the extent the Data Breach is attributable to Acme’s breach of this Agreement), in any investigation, remediation, notification to affected individuals or regulators, and any other measures required under applicable Law.

11.6 **Subprocessors.** Acme may engage subcontractors as subprocessors to process Client Data only with Contoso’s prior written consent (which may be by approval of a subprocessor list). Acme shall enter into written agreements with all subprocessors that impose data protection obligations substantially similar to those set out in this Agreement. Acme shall remain fully responsible for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors relating to Client Data.

11.7 **Data Subject Rights and Assistance.** Acme shall, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Acme, provide reasonable assistance to Contoso in responding to requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under applicable data protection Laws (e.g., rights of access, deletion, correction, and portability), and in complying with security, data breach notification, impact assessments, and consultation obligations under the GDPR and similar Laws.

11.8 **Data Retention and Deletion.** Acme shall retain Client Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services and as required by applicable Law.

## ARTICLE XII  
## SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS

12.1 **Applicability.** This Article XII applies to any hosted or managed services, support, or maintenance Services provided by Acme under this Agreement, as further defined in applicable SOWs.

12.2 **Availability/Uptime.** Acme shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make the applicable hosted services available at least **99.9%** of the time in each calendar month, excluding Permitted Downtime. “Permitted Downtime” means:  
(a) scheduled maintenance windows notified to Contoso at least five (5) Business Days in advance and limited to four (4) hours per calendar month;  
(b) emergency maintenance required to address critical security or performance issues, provided Acme uses reasonable efforts to minimize disruption and informs Contoso as soon as practicable; and  
(c) downtime due to Force Majeure Events, provided Acme complies with Article XV.

12.3 **Support Response and Resolution Times.** Acme shall provide support and incident management in accordance with the following target response and resolution times, measured from the time Contoso submits a ticket through Acme’s designated support channels:

   - **Severity 1 (Critical)**: System unavailable or severely impacted.  
     - Initial response: within 1 hour (24x7).  
     - Target resolution or workaround: within 4 hours.

   - **Severity 2 (High)**: Major functionality impaired, no reasonable workaround.  
     - Initial response: within 4 Business Hours.  
     - Target resolution or workaround: within 1 Business Day.

   - **Severity 3 (Medium)**: Non-critical issue with workarounds available.  
     - Initial response: within 1 Business Day.  
     - Target resolution or workaround: within 5 Business Days.

   - **Severity 4 (Low)**: Minor issues, cosmetic defects, or general inquiries.  
     - Initial response: within 2 Business Days.  
     - Resolution on a commercially reasonable efforts basis.

12.4 **Service Credits.** If Acme fails to meet the uptime commitment in Section 12.2 in any calendar month (excluding Permitted Downtime), Contoso shall be entitled to service credits as follows, calculated as a percentage of the monthly Fees for the affected hosted services:

   - Actual uptime of 99.0% to < 99.9%: 5% credit  
   - Actual uptime of 98.0% to < 99.0%: 10% credit  
   - Actual uptime of < 98.0%: 20% credit  

To receive a service credit, Contoso must submit a written request within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the failure occurred. Service credits shall be applied against the next invoice or, if no future invoices remain, refunded to Contoso.

12.5 **Chronic SLA Failures.** If Acme fails to meet the uptime commitment in three (3) or more calendar months in any rolling six (6)-month period, or if Acme repeatedly fails to meet Severity 1 response times, such failures shall constitute a material breach, and Contoso may, in addition to any other remedies, terminate the affected SOW or hosted services upon thirty (30) days’ written notice if Acme does not cure.

12.6 **SLA as Exclusive Remedy.** Service credits under this Article XII shall be Contoso’s sole and exclusive monetary remedy for failure to meet the uptime commitments, except where such failure constitutes a material breach not cured as provided above, in which case Contoso may also pursue termination and other remedies consistent with this Agreement.

## ARTICLE XIII  
## CHANGE MANAGEMENT

13.1 **Change Requests.** Either Party may request changes to the scope, Deliverables, schedule, or other aspects of the Services under an SOW by submitting a written change request describing the proposed change in reasonable detail.

13.2 **Evaluation of Changes.** Upon receipt of a change request, the receiving Party shall promptly review the request. If Acme receives a change request from Contoso, Acme shall, within ten (10) Business Days (or such other period as the Parties agree), provide a written impact assessment including:  
(a) changes to scope or Deliverables;  
(b) any impact on Fees;  
(c) any impact on schedule or milestones; and  
(d) any associated assumptions or risks.

13.3 **Change Orders.** No change shall be effective unless documented in a written Change Order that:  
(a) references the applicable SOW or PO;  
(b) describes the agreed changes;  
(c) sets forth any adjustments to Fees, schedule, or other terms; and  
(d) is executed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Until a Change Order is fully executed, the Parties shall continue to perform their respective obligations under the existing SOW or PO without change.

13.4 **Urgent Changes.** For urgent changes necessary to address critical issues or regulatory requirements, the Parties may agree in writing (including by email between authorized representatives) to a temporary change pending formal documentation in a Change Order, provided that such temporary agreement clearly states its scope and duration.

## ARTICLE XIV  
## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

14.1 **Good Faith Negotiations.** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof (a **“Dispute”**), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute promptly by negotiation between executives who have authority to settle the Dispute. Either Party may initiate negotiation by providing written notice of the Dispute to the other Party. The executives shall meet (in person, by telephone, or by videoconference) within fifteen (15) days after such notice and as often as they reasonably deem necessary.

14.2 **Mediation.** If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute through negotiation within thirty (30) days after initiation of negotiation, either Party may request that the Dispute be submitted to non-binding mediation. The Parties shall select a mutually acceptable mediator within fifteen (15) days of such request. The mediation shall be conducted in San Francisco, California, unless the Parties agree otherwise, under the rules of a recognized mediation provider (e.g., JAMS). The Parties shall share the mediator’s fees and expenses equally, and each Party shall bear its own costs and attorneys’ fees.

14.3 **Arbitration or Litigation.** If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days after the mediator is appointed, either Party may pursue its rights and remedies in court or, by mutual agreement at that time, arbitration. In the absence of such mutual agreement to arbitrate, each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and waives any objection based on inconvenient forum.

14.4 **Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction at any time if necessary to protect its Confidential Information, Intellectual Property Rights, or Client Data, or to prevent irreparable harm, without first engaging in negotiation or mediation.

14.5 **Continued Performance.** During the pendency of any Dispute, the Parties shall continue to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement to the extent reasonably practicable, except to the extent such performance is the subject of the Dispute or has been properly terminated.

---

## ARTICLE XV  
## FORCE MAJEURE

15.1 **Force Majeure Events.** Neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance under this Agreement (other than payment obligations) to the extent caused by events beyond its reasonable control, including: acts of God, natural disasters, epidemics or pandemics, war, terrorism, civil unrest, labor disputes (other than those of the affected Party’s own workforce), governmental actions, or failures of third-party telecommunications or hosting providers (each, a **“Force Majeure Event”**).

15.2 **Notice and Mitigation.** The affected Party shall:  
(a) promptly notify the other Party in writing of the Force Majeure Event and its anticipated duration and impact;  
(b) use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event; and  
(c) resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable.

15.3 **Termination for Extended Force Majeure.** If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and materially affects performance of a material part of the Services, either Party may terminate the affected SOW or PO upon written notice, without further liability except for payment of Fees for Services performed and Products delivered prior to the effective date of termination.
